<h3>RELIGION IN OUR STATE INSTITUTIONS.</h3>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p>“No member of this State shall be disfranchised or deprived of any of the rights or privileges secured to
any citizens thereof, unless by the law of the land or the judgment of his peers.”</p>

<p>“The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference,
shall for ever be allowed in this State to all mankind.”&mdash;<cite>Constitution of the State of New York</cite>,
Art. i. Sects. 1 and 3.</p>

</div>

<p>The first article of all the old
English charters which were embodied
in, and confirmed by, the
Great Charter wrung from King
John, was, “First of all, we wish the
church of God to be free.” In the
days when those charters were
drawn up there was no dispute as
to which was “the church of God.”
The religious unity of Christendom
had not yet been reformed into a
thousand contending sects, each of
which was a claimant to the title
of “the church of God.” The two
sections of our own constitution
quoted from above, which establish
in their fullest sense the civil and
religious liberty of the individual,
are taken from those grand old
charters of Catholic days. The
only thing practically new in them
is the substitution, for the “church
of God,” of “the free exercise and
enjoyment of religious profession
and worship, without discrimination
or preference.” The reason for
this alteration is plain. Civil liberty
is impossible without religious
liberty. But here the founders of
our constitution were confronted
with a great difficulty. To follow
out the old Catholic tradition, and
grant freedom to the “church of
God,” was impossible. There were
so many “churches of God,” antagonistic
to one another, that to
pronounce for one was to pronounce
against all others, and so establish
a state religion. This they found
themselves incompetent to do. Accordingly,
leaving the title open,
complete freedom of religious profession
and worship was proclaimed
as being the only thing commensurate
with complete civil liberty
and that large, generous, yet withal
safe freedom of the individual which
forms the corner-stone of the republic.</p>

<p>This really constitutes what is
commonly described as the absolute
separation of church and state, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
which we are never weary of congratulating
ourselves. It is not
that the state ignores the church
(or churches), but that it recognizes
it in the deepest sense, as a power
that has a province of its own, in
the direction of human life and
thought, where the state may not
enter&mdash;a province embracing all
that is covered by the word religion.
This is set apart by the state, voluntarily,
not blindly; as a sacred,
not as an unknown and unrecognized,
ground, which it may invade
at any moment. It is set apart for
ever, and as long as the American
Constitution remains what it is, will
so remain, sacred and inviolate.
Men are free to believe and worship,
not only in conscience, but in
person, as pleases them, and no
state official may ever say to them,
“Worship thus or thus!”</p>

<p>Words would be wasted in dwelling
on this point. There is not a
member of the state who has not
the law, as it were, born in his
blood. No man ever dreams of interfering
with the worship of another.
Catholic church and Jewish
tabernacle and Methodist meeting-house
nestle together side by side,
and their congregations come and
go, year in year out, and worship,
each in its own way, without a breath
of hindrance. Conversion or perversion,
as it may be called, on any side
is not attempted, save at any particular
member’s good-will and pleasure.
Each may possibly entertain the
pious conviction that his neighbor is
going directly to perdition, but he
never dreams of disputing that neighbor’s
right of way thither. And the
thought of a state official or an official
of any character coming in and
directly or indirectly ordering the
Catholics to become Methodists, or
the Methodists Jews, or the Jews
either, is something so preposterous
that the American mind can scarcely
entertain it. Yet, strange as it is
painful to confess, just such coercion
of conscience is carried on
safely, daily and hourly, under our
very noses, by State or semi-state
officials. Ladies and gentlemen
to whom the State has entrusted
certain of its wards are in the habit
of using the powers bestowed on
them to restrain “the free exercise
of religious profession and worship,”
and not simply to restrain it, but to
compel numbers of those under their
charge to practise a certain form
of religious profession and worship
which, were they free agents, they
would never practise, and against
which their conscience must revolt.</p>

<p>This coercion is more or less
generally practised in the prisons,
hospitals, reformatories, asylums,
and such like, erected by the State
for such of its members or wards as
crime or accident have thrown on
its hands. Besides those mainly
supported by the State, there are
many other institutions which volunteer
to take some of its work off
the hands of the State, and for
which due compensation is given.
In short, the majority of our public
institutions will come within the
scope of our observations. And it
may be as well to premise here that
our observations are intended chiefly
to expose a wrong that we, as
Catholics, feel keenly and suffer
from; but the arguments advanced
will be of a kind that may serve for
any who suffer under a similar grievance,
and who claim for themselves
or their co-religionists “the free
exercise of religious profession and
worship, without discrimination or
preference.” If the violation of this
article of the constitution to-day
favors one side under our ever-shifting
parties and platforms, it may to-morrow
favor the other. What we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
demand is simply that the constitution
be strictly maintained, and
not violated under any cover whatsoever.</p>

<p>The inmates of our institutions
may be divided into two broad
classes, the criminal and the unfortunate.
From the very fact of their
being inmates of the institutions
both alike suffer certain deprivation
of “the rights and privileges”
secured to them as citizens. In the
case of criminals those rights and
privileges are forfeited. They are
deprived of personal liberty, because
they are a danger instead of a
support to the State and to the
commonwealth. The question that
meets us here is, does the restriction
of personal involve also that
of religious liberty and worship?</p>

<p>Happily, there is no need to argue
the matter at any length, as it has
already been pronounced upon by
the State; and as regards the religious
discipline in prisons, our objection
is as much against a non-application
as a misapplication of
the law. “The free exercise and
enjoyment of religious profession
and worship” is never debarred any
man by the State. On the contrary,
it is not only enjoined, but,
where possible, provided. Even
the criminal who has fallen under
the supreme sentence of the law,
and whose very life is forfeit to the
State, is in all cases allowed the
full and free ministry of the pastor
of his church, whatever that church
may be. Nothing is allowed to
interfere with their communion.
Even the ordinary discipline of the
prison is broken into in favor of that
power to which, from the very first,
the State set a region apart. And
it is only at the last moment of life
that the minister, be he Catholic,
Methodist, or Jew, yields to the
hangman.</p>

<p>Is it possible to think that the
State, which, in the exercise of its
last and most painful prerogative,
shows itself so wise, just, tender
even, and profoundly religious&mdash;so
true, above all, to the letter and the
spirit of the constitution&mdash;should,
when the question concerns not the
taking, but the guarding, of the
criminal’s life, and, if possible, its
guidance to a better end, show itself
cruel, parsimonious, and a petty
proselytizer? Does it hold that
freedom of religious profession and
worship is a privilege to be granted
only to that superior grade of criminal
whose deeds have fitted him before
his time for another world, and
not to the lesser criminal or the
unfortunate, who is condemned to
the burden of life, and who has it
still within his power to make that
life a good and useful one? Such a
question is its own answer. And
yet the system of religious discipline
at present prevailing in many
of our prisons, as in most of our institutions,
would seem to indicate
that the State exhausts its good-will
over murderers, and leaves all other
inmates, in matters of religion, to
the ministry of men in whom they
do not believe and creeds that they
reject. A certain form of religious
discipline is provided, which is
bound to do duty for all the prisoners,
Jew and Gentile, Catholic and
Protestant alike. If that is not good
enough for them, they may not even
do without it; for all are bound to
attend religious worship, which, in
the case of Catholic prisoners at
least&mdash;for we adhere to our main
point&mdash;is beyond all doubt the severest
coercion of conscience. The
worst Catholic in this world would
never willingly take part in the worship
of any but his own creed. It
is idle to ask whether some worship
is not better for him than none at all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
The fact remains that he does not
believe in any other but his own
church, in the sacredness of any
other ministry but his own, in the
efficacy of any means of grace save
those that come to him through the
church of which he is a member.
More than this, he knows that it is
a sin not to approach the sacraments
and hear Mass, and that,
without frequenting them, he cannot
hope to lead a really good life.
The perversion of discipline prevents
him either hearing Mass or
frequenting the sacraments, often
even from seeing a priest at all.</p>

<p>There is no need to dwell on the
fact that of all men in this world,
those who are in prison or in confinement
stand most in need of constant
spiritual aid and consolation.
Indeed, in many cases the term of
imprisonment would be the most
favorable time to work upon their
souls. The efficacy of religion in
helping to reform criminals is recognized
by the State in establishing
prison chaplains, and even making
attendance at worship compulsory.
But this compulsion is not intended
so much as an act of coercion
of conscience as an opportunity
and means of grace. As seen in
the case of murderers, the State is
only too happy to grant whatever
spiritual aid it can to the criminal,
without restriction of any kind.</p>

<p>Laying aside, then, as granted, the
consideration that spiritual ministry
is of a reforming tendency in the
case of those who come freely under
its influence, we pass on at once
to show where in our own State we
are lamentably deficient and unjust
in failing to supply that ministry.</p>

<p>In this State there are three State
prisons: those of Sing Sing, Auburn,
and Clinton. In no one of them is
there proper provision for the spiritual
needs of Catholic prisoners.</p>

<p>There are also in this State seven
penitentiaries: Blackwell’s Island,
New York; Kings County, Staten
Island, Albany, Syracuse, Rochester,
and Buffalo. Of these seven, in
three only is Mass celebrated and
the sacraments administered, viz.,
Blackwell’s Island, Kings County,
and Albany.</p>

<p>The State boasts also of four reformatories:
the Catholic Protectory,
Westchester County; House of
Refuge, New York; Juvenile Asylum,
New York; Western House of
Refuge, Rochester. Of these, at the
first named only is Mass celebrated
and the sacraments administered.</p>

<p>This is a very lamentable state of
affairs, and one that ought to be
remedied as speedily as possible.
It is being remedied in many places,
for it prevails practically throughout
the country. Catholics, unfortunately,
add their quota to the
criminal list, as to every grade and
profession in life. But there is no
reason why Catholic criminals alone
should be debarred the means
which is more likely than the punishment
of the law to turn their
minds and hearts to good&mdash;the sacraments
and ministry of their
church. But the fault, probably, in
the particular case of prisons, consists
in the fact that the grievance
has not hitherto been fairly set before
the authorities in whose hands
the remedy lies. The application
of the remedy, indeed, is chiefly a
question of demand, for it consists
in conformity to the constitution.</p>

<p>The Catholic Union of New York
has been at pains to collect testimony
on this subject, and the testimony
is unanimous as to the advisability
of allowing Catholic prisoners
free access to priests, sacraments,
and Mass. In Great Britain,
where there really is a state religion,
Catholic as well as Protestant chaplains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
are appointed to the various
prisons and reformatories, as also
to the army and navy. In answer
to an inquiry from the Catholic Union
respecting the system on which
British reformatories are managed
in regard to the religious instruction
afforded to their Catholic inmates,
the following letter was received:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Office of Inspector of Reformatory
and Industrial Schools, No. 3
Delahay Street</span>, December 7, 1874.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>: In reference to your letter of the
20th ultimo, I beg to forward you a copy
of the last report of the Inspector of Reformatory
and Industrial Schools.</p>

<p>“You will observe that almost all the
schools are denominational; one reformatory
(the Northeastern) and one or
two industrial schools alone receiving
both Protestant and Roman Catholic
children.</p>

<p>“In these cases the children of the latter
faith are visited at stated times by a
priest of their own religion, and allowed
to attend service on Sundays in the nearest
Catholic chapel.</p>

<p>“The Catholic schools are solely and
entirely for Catholics.</p>

<p class="center">“I am, sir, your faithful servant,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">William Costeker</span>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dr. E. B. O’Callaghan.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>In the British provinces on this
continent the same system prevails.
Equal religious freedom is guaranteed
in all reformatories and prisons.
In the Province of Quebec,
where the French population and
Catholic religion predominate, the
system is the same. Throughout
Europe it is practically the same.
Rev. G. C. Wines, D.D., the accredited
representative of our government
to the International Penitentiary
Congress at London, in his
report to the President, February
12, 1873, gave most powerful testimony
on this point. A few extracts
will suffice for our purpose.</p>

<p>In England “every convict prison
has its staff of ministers of religion.
For the most part, the chaplains
are not permitted to have any
other occupations than those pertaining
to their office, thus being
left free to devote their whole time
to the improvement of the prisoners.”</p>

<p>In Ireland, in this respect, “the
regulations and usages of the convict
prisons are substantially the
same.”</p>

<p>In France, in the smaller departmental
prisons, “some parish priest
acts as chaplain.” In the larger, as
well as in all central prisons, “the
chaplain is a regular officer of the
establishment, and wholely devoted
to its religious service.” “Liberty
of conscience is guaranteed to prisoners
of all religions.” If the prisoner,
who must declare his faith on
entering, is not a Catholic, “he is
transferred, whenever it is possible,
to a prison designed to receive persons
of the same religious faith as
himself.”</p>

<p>In Prussia “chaplains are provided
for all prisons and for all religions.
They hold religious service,
give religious lessons, inspect
the prison schools,” etc.</p>

<p>In Saxony “the religious wants
of the prisoners are equally regarded
and cared for, whatever their
creed may be.”</p>

<p>In Würtemberg “in all the prisons
there are Protestant and Catholic
chaplains. For prisoners of the
Jewish faith there is similar provision
for religious instruction.”</p>

<p>In Baden “chaplains are provided
for all prisons and for all religions.”</p>

<p>In Austria, “in the prisons of all
kinds, chaplains and religious teachers
are provided for prisoners of
every sect.”</p>

<p>In Russia “in all the large prisons
there are chapels and chaplains.
Prisoners of all the different creeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
receive the offices of religion from
ministers of their own faith, even
Jews and Mussulmans.”</p>

<p>In the Netherlands, “in all the
central prisons, in all the houses of
detention, and in the greater part
of the houses of arrest, the office
of chaplain and religious services
are confided to one of the parish
ministers of each religion, who is
named by the Minister of Justice.”</p>

<p>In Switzerland “ministers of the
reformed and of the Catholic religion
act as chaplains in the prisons.
The rabbi of the nearest locality
is invited to visit such co-religionists
as are occasionally found in
them.”</p>

<p>Is it not sad, after testimony of
this kind, to come back to our own
country, and, with the law on the
point so plain, to find the practice
so wretchedly deficient? In New
York State Mass is celebrated in
three penitentiaries and one reformatory
only, and that solitary reformatory
is denominational. It was
only last year that a Mass was
celebrated for the first time in a
Boston prison, and a chaplain appointed
to it. In Auburn prison a
priest has only recently been allowed
to visit the Catholic prisoners,
hear confessions, and preach on
Sunday afternoons. But the prisoners
are compelled to attend the
Protestant services also.</p>

<p>In the State prison at Dannemora,
Clinton Co., N. Y., where a
Catholic chaplain has only of
late been appointed, the prisoners
hear Mass but once a month.</p>

<p>In the Western House of Refuge,
a branch house of an establishment
in this city, to which attention will
be called presently, it was only after
a severe conflict<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that in December
of last year permission
was granted “to Catholic and all
ministers” of free access to the
asylum “to conduct religious
exercises, etc.,” and that Catholic
children be no longer compelled
“to attend what is called ‘non-sectarian’
services.” Such testimony
might be multiplied all over
the country. Indeed, as far as
our present knowledge goes, the
State of Minnesota is the only State
wherein “liberty of conscience and
equal rights in matters of religion
to the inmates of State institutions”
have been secured, and they were
only <em>secured</em> by an act approved
March 5, 1874.</p>

<p>Catholics are content to believe
that the main difficulty in the way
of affording Catholic instruction to
the Catholic inmates of such institutions
has hitherto rested with
themselves. Either they have not
sufficiently exposed the grievance
they were compelled to endure, or,
more likely, such exposure was
useless, inasmuch as the paucity of
priests prevented any being detailed
to the special work of the prisons
and public institutions. This,
too, is probably the difficulty in the
army and navy of the United States,
which boast of two Catholic chaplains
in all, and those two for the
army only. But the growth of our
numbers, resources, dioceses, and
clergy is rapidly removing any
further obstruction on that score;
so that there is no further reason
why Catholic priests should not be
allowed to attend to and&mdash;always, of
course, at due times&mdash;perform the
duties of their office for inmates of
institutions who, by reason of their
confinement, are prevented from the
free exercise of their religious profession
and worship laid down and
guaranteed in the constitution to all
mankind for ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>But over and above the strictly
criminal class of inmates of our
State institutions there is another,
a larger and more important class,
to be considered&mdash;that already
designated as unfortunate. Most
of its members, previous to their
admission into the institutions provided
for their keeping, have hovered
on that extreme confine where
poverty and crime touch each other.
Many of them have just crossed
the line into the latter region.
Inmates of hospitals and insane
asylums will come, without further
mention, within the scope of our
general observations. Our attention
now centres on those inmates of
State or public institutions who, for
whatever reasons, in consequence
either of having no home or inadequate
protection at home, are
thrown absolutely upon the hands
of the State, which is compelled in
some way or other to act towards
them <i lang="la">in loco parentis</i>. In the majority
of cases there is hope that they
may by proper culture and care be
converted, from a threatened danger
to the State, to society at large,
and to themselves, into honest,
creditable, and worthy citizens.</p>

<p>This class, composed of the
youth of both sexes, instead of diminishing,
seems, with the spread
of population, to be on the increase.
From its ranks the criminal and
pauper classes, which are also on
the increase, are mainly recruited.
The criminal, in the eye of the law,
who has led a good life up to manhood
or womanhood, is the exception.
Crime, as representative of
a class, is a growth, not a sudden
aberration. It is, then, a serious and
solemn duty of the State to cut off
this criminal growth by converting
the class who feed it to good at the
outset. At the very lowest estimate
it is a duty of self-preservation.
This being so, there is no need to
dwell on the plain fact that it is the
duty of the State to do all that in it
lies to lead the lives of those unfortunates
out of the wrong path into
the right. Every means at its disposal
ought to be worked to that
end. There is still less reason to
dwell on the fact, acknowledged
and recognized by the State and by
all men, that, in leading a life away
from evil and up to good, no influence
is so powerful as that of religion.
The fear of man, of the power
and vengeance of the law, is undoubtedly
of great force; but it is
not all, nor is it the strongest influence
that can be brought to bear
on the class indicated, not yet criminal.
At the best it represents to
their minds little more than the
whip of the slave-driver&mdash;something
to be feared, but something also to
be hated, and to be defied and broken
where defiance may for the
time seem safe. But the moral
sense, the sense of right and wrong,
of good and evil, which shows law
in its true guise as the benignant representative
of order rather than the
terror of disorder, is a higher guide,
a truer teacher, and a more humane
and lasting power.</p>

<p>This sense can only come with
religion; and so convinced is the
State of this fact that, as usual, it
calls in religion to its aid, and over
its penitentiaries and reformatories
sets chaplains. It goes further even,
and, as in prisons, compels the inmates
of such institutions to attend
religious services, practise religious
observances, and listen to religious
instruction. There is no State reformatory&mdash;it
is safe to say no reformatory
at all&mdash;without such religious
worship and instruction.</p>

<p>This careful provision for the
spiritual wants of so extensive and
important a class we of course approve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to the full. The idea of a
reformatory where no religious instruction
is given the inmates
would be a contradiction. The
State empowers those into whose
hands it entrusts the keeping of its
wards to impart religious instruction&mdash;in
short, to do everything that
may tend to the mental, moral, and
physical advancement of those under
their charge. All that we concede
and admire. But the State
never empowers those who have the
control of such institutions to draw
up laws or rules for them which
should in any way contravene the
law of the State, least of all that
article of the constitution wherein
the free exercise of religious profession
and worship, without discrimination
or preference, is allowed
to all mankind in this State for
ever. But it is just in this most important
point that our public institutions
signally fail.</p>

<p>Here is our point: In our public
institutions there is, in the case of
Catholic inmates, a constant and
persistent violation of the constitution
of the State regarding freedom
of religious profession and worship.
In those institutions there is a stereotyped
system of religious profession
and worship, which all the inmates,
of whatever creed, are compelled
to accept and observe. They
have no freedom of choice in the
matter. They may not hold any
religious intercourse with the pastors
of their church, save, in impossible
instances, on that stereotyped
plan. Practically, they may not
hold any such intercourse at all.
Once they become inmates of these
institutions, the freedom of religious
profession and worship that they
enjoyed, or were at liberty to enjoy,
before entering, is completely
cut off, and a new form of religious
profession and practice, which,
whether they like it or not, whether
they believe it or not, they are compelled
to observe and accept as their
religion until they leave the institution,
is substituted. No matter
what name may be given this mode
of worship and instruction, whether
it be called “non-sectarian” or not,
it is a monstrous violation of human
conscience, not to speak of the letter
and the spirit of the constitution
of this State. Its proper name
would be the “Church Established
in Public Institutions.” From the
day when a Catholic child crosses
the threshold of such an institution
until he leaves it, in most cases he
is not allowed even to see a Catholic
clergyman; he is certainly not
allowed to practise his religion; he
is not allowed to read Catholic
books of instruction; he is not allowed
to hear Mass or frequent the
sacraments. For him his religion is
choked up and dammed off utterly,
and his soul left dry and barren.
Nor does the wrong rest even here;
for all the while he is exposed to
non-Catholic influences and to a
direct system of anti-Catholic instruction
and worship. He is compelled
to bow to and believe in the
“Church Established” in the institution.</p>

<p>There is, unfortunately, a superabundance
of evidence to prove all,
and more than all, our assertions.
There will be occasion to use it;
but just now we content ourselves
with such as is open to any citizen
of the State, and as is given in the
<cite>Reports</cite> of the various institutions.
Of these we select one&mdash;the oldest
in the State&mdash;the Society for the
Reformation of Juvenile Delinquents,
which has this year published
its fiftieth <cite>Annual Report</cite>. Within
these fifty years of its life 15,791
children, of ages ranging from five
to sixteen, of both sexes, of native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and foreign parentage, of every
complexion of color and creed, have
passed through its hands. The society
has, on more than one occasion,
come before the public, more
especially within the last two or
three years, in anything but an enviable
light. But all considerations
of that kind may pass for the present,
our main inquiry being, What
kind of religion, of religious discipline,
instruction, and worship, is
provided for the hundreds of children
who year by year enter this
asylum?</p>

<p>The “Circular to Parents and
Guardians,” signed by the president,
Mr. Edgar Ketchum, sets forth the
objects of the institution and the
manner in which it is conducted.
“For your information,” says Mr.
Ketchum to the parents and guardians,
“the managers deem it proper
to state that the institution is not a
place of punishment nor a prison,
but a reform school, where the inmates
receive such instruction and
training as are best adapted to form
and perpetuate a virtuous character.”
An excellent introduction!
Nothing could be better calculated
to allay any scruples that an
anxious parent or guardian might
entertain respecting the absolute
surrender of a child or ward to the
institution, “to remain during minority,
or until discharged by the
managers, as by due process of law.”
Of course the Catholic parent or
guardian who receives such a circular
will have no question as to
the “instruction and training best
adapted to form and (above all)
<em>to perpetuate a virtuous character</em>”!
The training up of “a virtuous
character” is, by all concession,
mainly a purely religious work,
and the Catholic knows, believes in,
and recognizes only one true religion&mdash;that
taught by the Catholic
Church. Whether he is right or
wrong in that belief is not the
question. It is sufficient to know
that the constitution recognizes and
respects it.</p>

<p>A few lines lower the Catholic
parent or guardian receives still
more satisfactory information on
this crucial point. After a glowing
description of the life of the inmates,
he is informed that they, “on
the Sabbath, are furnished with suitable
religious and moral instruction.”
Just what is wanted by the
child! “Sabbath,” it is true, has
come to have a Protestant sound;
but as for “suitable religious and
moral instruction,” there can be
no doubt that the only religious
instruction suitable for a Catholic
child is that of the Catholic religion,
and such as would be given
him outside in the Sunday-school
by the Catholic priest or teacher.
He is just as much a Catholic inside
that institution as he was outside;
and there is no more right in law
or logic to force upon him a system
of non-Catholic and anti-Catholic
instruction within than without its
walls. Let us see, then, of what this
moral and religious instruction consists;
if Catholic, all our difficulties
are over.</p>

<p>Turning a few pages, we come to
the “Report of the Chaplain.”
<em>The</em> chaplain! The chaplain, then,
is the gentleman charged with furnishing
“on the Sabbath” the
“suitable religious and moral instruction”
of the Catholic child.
The chaplain is the Rev. George
H. Smyth, evidently a clergyman
of some denomination. His name
is not to be found in the Catholic
directory. He is probably, then,
not a Catholic priest. However,
his report may enlighten us.</p>

<p>It occupies five and a half pages,
and renders an admirable account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of&mdash;the Rev. George H. Smyth,
who, to judge of him by his own report,
must be an exceedingly engaging
person, and above all a powerful
preacher. No doubt he is.
He informs us that the children
have shown, among other good
qualities, “an earnest desire to receive
instruction, both secular and
religious.” That is cheering news.
It is worthy of note, too, the distinction
made between the secular
and religious instruction of the
children. That is just the Catholic
ground. Children require both
kinds of instruction&mdash;instruction in
their religion, as well as in reading,
writing, ciphering, and so on. The
Catholic parent or guardian congratulates
himself, then, on the fact
that his child or ward will not be
deprived of instruction in his religion
while an inmate of the institution.
All satisfactory so far; but
let us read Mr. Smyth a little
more.</p>

<p>“Often have the chaplain’s counsel
and sympathy been sought by
those striving to lead a better life.”
Very natural! “And as often have
they been cordially tendered.” Still
more natural. Then follow some
pleasing reminiscences from the
boys and girls of the chaplain’s
good offices. He even vouchsafes,
almost unnecessarily, to inform us
that “the children have it impressed
on them that the object of the
preaching they hear is wholly to
benefit them.” It could not well
be otherwise. And Mr. Smyth’s
preaching evidently does benefit
them, for one of the boys remarked
to him, casually: “Chaplain, you
remember that sermon you preached”&mdash;neither
the sermon nor its
text, unfortunately, is given&mdash;“that
was the sermon that led me to the
Saviour.” Happy lad! It is to
be regretted that he ever came back.
We are farther informed of “the
close attention given by the children
to the preaching of the Gospel Sabbath
after Sabbath.” “On one
occasion a distinguished military
gentleman and statesman&mdash;an ambassador
from one of the leading
courts of Europe&mdash;was present. The
sermon was from the text <cite>Cleanse
thou me from secret faults</cite>.” So powerful
was Mr. Smyth’s sermon on
that occasion that the reverend
gentleman graciously informs us it
so moved the “distinguished military
gentleman and statesman” from
Europe that at the close he rose,
and, “taking the chaplain by the
hand, said with great warmth of
feeling, ‘That sermon was so well
suited to these children they must
be better for it. I saw it made a
deep impression upon them; but I
rose to thank you for myself&mdash;<em>it just
suited me</em>.’”</p>

<p>And there the story ends, leaving
us in a painful state of conjecture
respecting the state of that “distinguished
military gentleman and
statesman’s” conscience. These
little incidents are thrown off with
a naïve simplicity almost touching,
and are noticed here as they are
given, as establishing beyond all
doubt the clear and marked distinction
in nature and grace between
the Rev. Mr. Smyth and the dreadful
characters, whether ambassadors
or youthful pickpockets, with whom
Mr. Smyth is brought in contact.
But the main question for the Catholic
parent or guardian is, What
religious and moral instruction is
my child to receive? For it is clear
that Mr. Smyth is not a Catholic
clergyman. It seems that Mr.
Smyth being “<em>the</em> chaplain,” there
is no Catholic chaplain at all, and
no Catholic instruction at all for
Catholic children. Are the Catholic
children compelled, then, to attend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Mr. Smyth’s preaching and
Mr. Smyth’s worship, and nothing
but Mr. Smyth, excellent man though
he be? Mr. Ketchum has already,
in the name of the managers, informed
us that the institution is not
“a place of punishment.” Far be
it from us to hint, however remotely,
that it is a punishment even <em>to be
compelled</em> to listen to the preaching
of such a man as Mr. Smyth. With
the evidence before us, how could
such a thought be entertained for a
moment? But at least how is this
state of things reconcilable with
that solemn article of the constitution
already quoted so often?</p>

<p>However, let us first dismiss Mr.
Smyth, after ascertaining, if possible,
what it is he does teach. Here
we have it in his own words: “The
truths preached to these children
[all the inmates of the institution]
have been those fundamental truths
held in common by all Christian
communions, and which are adapted
to the wants of the human race,
and must ever be the foundation of
pure morals and good citizenship.
Studious care has been taken not
to prejudice the minds of the inmates
against any particular form
of religious belief.”</p>

<p>Here lies the essence of what we
have called the “Church Established
in Public Institutions.” The
favorite term for it is “non-sectarian”
teaching; and on the ground
that it is “non-sectarian,” that it
favors no particular church or
creed, but is equally available to
all, it has thus far been upheld
and maintained in our public institutions.
It is well to expose the
cant and humbug of this non-sectarianism
once for all.</p>

<p>In the first place, no such thing
exists. Let us adhere to the case
in point. Mr. Smyth, who is styled
“reverend,” is the chaplain of the
society we are examining. What
is the meaning of the word chaplain?
A clergyman appointed to
perform certain clerical duties. Mr.
Smyth is a clergyman of some denomination
or other, we care not
what. He is not a self-appointed
“reverend.” He must have been
brought up in some denomination
and educated in some theological
school. There is no such thing as
a “reverend” of no church, of a
non-sectarian church. Every clergyman
has been educated in some
theological school, or at least according
to some special form of
doctrine and belief, and has entered
the ministry as a teacher and
preacher of that special form of belief
and doctrine. If he leaves it, he
leaves it either for infidelity&mdash;in
which case he renounces his title
as a clergyman&mdash;or for some other
form of doctrine and belief to which
he turns, and of which, so long as
he remains in the ministry, he is the
teacher, propagator, and upholder.
If he is not this, he is a humbug.
To say that he is or can be non-sectarian&mdash;that
is, pledged to preach
no particular form of doctrine, or a
form of doctrine equally available
for all kinds of believers or non-believers&mdash;is
to talk the sheerest nonsense.
In all cases a clergyman
is, by virtue of his office and profession
and belief, pledged to some
form of doctrine and faith, which
unless he teaches, he is either a
coward or a humbug. Anything
resembling a “non-sectarian” clergyman
would be exactly like a soldier
who bound himself by oath to a
certain government, yet held himself
free not to defend that government,
or, when he saw it attacked, to be particularly
careful not to do anything
that might possibly offend or oppose
the foe. The world and his
own government would stamp such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
a man as the vilest of beings&mdash;a
traitor. The union of such diametrically
opposite professions is a
sheer impossibility.</p>

<p>Let us test the doctrine Mr.
Smyth himself lays down here, or
which the managers of the institution
have laid down for him, and
show how sectarianism, which is
the one thing to be avoided, or, to
use a kinder term, denominationalism,
must inevitably meet the teacher
or preacher at every turn. “The
truths preached to these children
have been those fundamental truths
held in common by all Christian
communions.” Mr. Smyth has told
us already that “the chaplain’s
counsel and sympathy are sought
by those striving to lead a better
life, and with good results.” There
must, then, be questioning on the
part of the children. Indeed, how
could instruction possibly go on
without question, explanation, objection,
and answer? Let us begin,
then, with the very foundation of
his doctrine. The first question
that would occur to any one would
be, What are “those fundamental
truths held in common by all <em>Christian</em>
communions”? Mr. Smyth
does not mention one. Where shall
we find one? A fundamental truth
held in common by all Christian
communions might at least be supposed
to be a belief in Christ. Very
well. Then who is Christ? Where
is Christ? Is Christ God or man,
or both? How do we come to
know him? Is Christ not God, is
he not man? What is his history?
Where is it found? In the Bible?
What is the Bible? Who wrote
the Bible? Why must we accept
it as the Word of God? Is it the
Word of God? Why “all Christian
communions” are at war right on
this “fundamental truth,” from
which they derive their very name
of Christian, and not a single question
can be put or answered without
introducing denominationalism
of some kind or another, and so at
least prejudicing the minds of the
inmates against <em>some</em> particular
form of religious belief.</p>

<p>Take another supposition. Surely,
belief in God would be “a fundamental
truth held in common by all
Christian communions.” Here we
begin again. Who is God? What
is God? Where is God? Is God
a spirit? Is God a trinity or a
unity? Is there only one God?
Do all men believe in and worship
the same God? All at sea again at
the very mention of God’s name!</p>

<p>Take the belief in a future. Does
man end here? Does he live again
after death? Will the future be
happy or miserable? Is there a
hell or a heaven? Is there an everlasting
life? What is Mr. Smyth’s
own opinion on such “fundamental
truth”? There is not a single
“fundamental truth” “held in common
by all Christian communions.”
What is truth itself? What is a
fundamental truth? Fundamental
to what? Why, there is not a single
religious subject of any kind whatever
that can be mentioned to
“Christian communions” of a mixed
character which will not on the instant
create as many contentions as
there are members of various Christian
communions present. Let Mr.
Smyth try it outside, and see. Let
him preach on “fundamental truth”
to any mixed congregation in New
York; let there be free discussion
after, and what would be the result?
It is hard to say. But in all probability
the discussion would end by
the State, in the persons of its representatives,
stepping in to eject
the fundamental truths from the
building.</p>

<p>One need not go beyond this to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
show how necessarily sectarian
must Mr. Smyth’s religious instruction
and preaching be. But the
very next sentence bristles with
direct antagonism to Catholic teaching:
“What delinquent children
need is not the mere memorizing
of ecclesiastical formularies and
dogmas, which they can repeat one
moment and commit a theft the
next.” In plain English, Catholic
children do not need to learn their
catechism, which is the compendium
of Christian doctrine. What
is the use of learning it, asks Mr.
Smyth, when they can “commit a
theft the next moment”? He had
better go higher, and ask Christian
members of Congress how they can
address such pious homilies to
interesting Young Men’s Christian
Associations, while they know they
have been guilty of stealing. He
might even ask the Rev. George
H. Smyth how he could reconcile
it with his conscience to take an
oath or make a solemn promise on
entering the ministry to preach a
certain form of doctrine, and profess
to throw that oath and promise
to the winds immediately on being
offered a salary to teach something
quite different on Randall’s Island.
“But they do need, and it is the
province of the State to teach them
that there are, <em>independent of any
and all forms of religious faith</em>,
fundamental principles of eternal
right, truth, and justice, which, as
members of the human family and
citizens of the commonwealth,
they must learn to live by, and
which are absolutely essential to
their peace and prosperity. These
principles are inseparable from a
sound education, and must underlie
any and every system of religion
that is not a sham and a delusion.”</p>

<p>That sounds very fine, and it is
almost painful to be compelled to
spoil its effect. One cannot help
wondering in what theological
school Mr. Smyth studied. He
will insist on his “fundamental
principles,” which, in the preceding
paragraph, are “common to all
Christian communions,” but have
now become “independent of any
and all forms of religious faith.” Is
there any “fundamental principle
of <em>eternal</em> right, truth, and justice”
which, to “members of the human
family,” is “independent of any
and all forms of <em>religious</em> faith”?
Is there anything breathing of
<em>eternity</em> at all that comes not to us
in and through “religious faith”?
If there be such “fundamental
principles of eternal right, truth,
and justice,” in God’s name let us
know them; for they <em>are</em> religion,
and we are ready to throw “any
and all forms of religious faith”
that contradict those eternal principles
to the winds. This we know:
that there is not a single “principle
of <em>eternal</em> right, truth, and justice”
which, according to Mr. Smyth,
“it is the province of the State to
teach delinquent children,” that
did not come to the State through
some form or another of religious
faith; for in the history of this
world religion has always preceded
and, in its “fundamental principles
of eternal right, truth, and justice,”
instructed and informed the state.
The Rev. George H. Smyth is
either an infidel or he does not
know of what he is writing.</p>

<p>What kind of “moral and religious
instruction” is likely to be
imparted to all children, and to Catholic
children of all, by the Rev.
George H. Smyth, may be judged
from the foregoing. Whether or
not his teaching can approve itself
to a Catholic conscience may be
left to the judgment of all fair-minded
men. His report is only quoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
further to show how completely subject
the consciences of all these children
are to him:</p>

<p>“The regular preaching service
each Sabbath morning in the
chapel has been conducted by the
chaplain, one or more of the managers
usually being present; also,
the Wednesday lecture for the officers.
In the supervision of the
Sabbath-schools in the afternoon
he has been greatly aided by managers
Ketchum and Herder, whose
valuable services have been gratefully
appreciated by the teachers
and improved (<i lang="la">sic</i>) by the inmates.</p>

<p>“<em>The course of religious instruction
laid down in the by-laws and pursued
in the house for fifty years has
been closely adhered to.</em>” That is to
say, for fifty years not a syllable of
Catholic instruction has been imparted
to the Catholic inmates of
the House of Refuge. The number
of those Catholic inmates will presently
appear.</p>

<p>Among the gentlemen to whom
the chaplain records his “obligations”
for their gratuitous services
in the way of lectures are
found the names of nine Protestant
clergymen and two Protestant laymen.
No mention of a Catholic.
The Sabbath-school of the Reformed
Church, Harlem, is thanked
for “a handsome supply” of the
<cite>Illustrated Christian Weekly</cite>. The
librarian reports that one hundred
copies of the <cite>Youth’s Companion</cite>
are supplied weekly, one hundred
copies of the <cite>American Messenger</cite>,
and one hundred and twenty-five
copies of the <cite>Child’s Paper</cite>. There
is no mention of a Catholic print
of any kind. The chaplain and
librarian are under no obligations
for copies of the <cite>Young Catholic</cite>, or
the New York <cite>Tablet</cite>, or the <cite>Catholic
Review</cite>, or any one of our many
Catholic journals. They are all forbidden.
Yet they are not a whit
more “sectarian” than the <cite>Christian
Weekly</cite>. In addition, the
Bible Society is thanked “for a
supply of Bibles sufficient to give
each child a copy on his discharge.”</p>

<p>We turn now to the report of the
principal of schools. It is chiefly
an anti-Catholic tirade on the public
school question, but that point may
pass for the present. What we are
concerned with here is the species
of instruction to which the Catholic
children of the institution are subjected.
Mr. G. H. Hallock, the
principal, is almost “unco guid.”
A single passage will suffice. “But
underneath all this intellectual
awakening there is a grander work
to be performed; there is a moral
regeneration that can be achieved.
Shall we stand upon the environs
of this moral degradation among
our boys, and shrink from the duty
we owe them, because they are
hardened in sin and apparently
given over to evil influences?
Would He who came to save the
‘lost’ have done this?</p>

<p>“<em>Nothing can supply the place of
earnest, faithful religious teaching
drawn from the Word of God.</em> I
have the most profound convictions
of the inefficacy of all measures of
reformation, except such as are
based on the Gospel and pervaded
by its spirit. In vain are all
devices, if the heart and conscience,
beyond all power of external restraints,
are left untouched.”</p>

<p>It were easy to go on quoting
from Mr. Hallock, but this is more
than enough for our purpose.
Catholics too believe in the efficacy
of the Word of God, but in a different
manner, and to a great extent
in a different “Word” from that of
Mr. Hallock. It is plain that
this man is imbued with the spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of a missionary rather than of a
principal of schools, though how
Catholic sinners would fare at his
hands may be judged from the tone
of his impassioned harangue. The
missionary spirit is an excellent
spirit, and we have no quarrel with
Mr. Hallock or with his burning
desire to save lost souls; we only
venture to intimate that Mr. Hallock
is even less the kind of teacher
than Mr. Smyth is the kind of
preacher to whom we should entrust
the spiritual education of our
Catholic children. By the bye,
this excellent Mr. Hallock’s name
occurred during the trial of Justus
Dunn for the killing of Calvert,
one of the keepers of this very
institution, in 1872. One of the
witnesses in that eventful trial, a
free laborer in the house, testified
on oath concerning the punishment
of a certain boy there:</p>

<p>“<i>Q.</i> What was the boy punished
for?</p>

<p>“<i>A.</i> For not completing his task
and not doing it well. He was reported
for this to the assistant-superintendent,
Mr. Hallock. He
(Mr. Hallock) carried him down to
the office by his collar, and there
punished him for about fifteen
minutes with his cane, so that the
blood ran down the boy’s back;
then the assistant-superintendent
brought him back into the shop to
his place, and there struck him on
the side of the head, telling him
that if he did not do his work
right, he would give him more yet.
Then the boy cried out, ‘For God’s
sake! I am not able to do it.’ So
he took him by his neck, and carried
him to the office, where he caned
him again. After that he brought
the boy back to his place in the
shop, and treated him then as he
did on the other occasion. The
boy could not speak a word after
that. Then the assistant carried
him down to the office, and caned
him for the third time. After this
caning the boy could not come upstairs,
so they took him to the
hospital, where he died in about
four days. After his death a
correspondent wrote a letter to the
New York <cite>Tribune</cite>, stating the
facts, and asking for an investigation,
which took place. The punishment
of Mr. Hallock was his
deposition from his office as assistant
superintendent, and installation
as teacher of the school. The eye-witnesses
of the occurrence were
not examined, but the whole matter
was settled in the office of the
institution.”</p>

<p>This <i lang="fr">en passant</i>. It is pleasing,
after having read it, to be able to
testify to Mr. Hallock’s excellent
sentiments, as shown in the extract
already given from his report, which
concludes in this touching fashion:
“We are left to labor in the vineyard
amid scenes sometimes discouraging,
severe, and depressing
even. But, amid all, the sincere and
earnest worker may hear the voice
of the Great Teacher uttering words
of comfort and consolation: <em>Inasmuch
as ye have done it unto one of
the least of these my brethren, ye have
done it unto me</em>.” Those words of
consolation may be read in more
senses than one.</p>

<p>In keeping with all this is the
report of the president, Mr. Edgar
Ketchum. He also has the Catholics
in his eye. He is strong on the moral
training of the children and “the
mild discipline of the house,” of
which the public knows sufficient to
warrant our letting Mr. Ketchum’s
ironical expression pass without
comment. He is “far from discouraging
any effort to extend
Christian sympathy and aid to a
class who so deeply need them.”
He believes that “religion, in her
benign offices, will here and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
be found to touch some chord of
the soul, and make it vibrate for ever
with the power of a new life.”
What religion and what offices?
He is of opinion that “the interests
of society and the criminal concur;
and if his crimes have banished him
from all that makes life desirable,
<em>they need not carry with them also a
sentence of exclusion from whatever
a wise Christian philanthropy can do
in his behalf</em>.”</p>

<p>We quite agree with Mr. Ketchum.
Christian philanthropy, as far as it
extends in this world, with the solitary
exception of this country, has,
as already seen, by unanimous action,
annulled, if ever it existed, that
“sentence of exclusion” which shut
off the criminal, or the one whom
Mr. Ketchum designates as “the
victim of society,” from the free
profession and practice of his religion,
whether he were Catholic,
Protestant, Jew, or Mahometan.
That same “Christian philanthropy,”
as Mr. Ketchum is pleased to
call it, never peddled over by-laws,
or rules, or regulations, or “difficulties”
whose plain purpose was to
hinder Catholic children, confined
as are those in the house of which
he is president, from seeing their
priest, hearing their Mass, going to
confession, frequenting the sacraments,
and learning their catechism.
The same wise Christian philanthropy
framed that section of the
constitution, binding alike on Mr.
Ketchum and his charges, that was
precisely framed to prevent the
“sentence of exclusion” which Mr.
Ketchum so justly and with such
eloquence denounces. Christian
philanthropy can do no work more
worthy of itself than allowing these
unfortunate children, foremost and
above all things, the practice of that
form of Christianity which, were they
free agents, they would undoubtedly
follow; nor could it do anything less
worthy of itself than force upon
them a system of worship and religious
training which their hearts
abhor and their consciences reject.
It could not devise a more heinous
offence against God and man,
or a more hateful tyranny, than
that very “sentence of exclusion”
which, under the “mild discipline
of the house,” prevails in the society
of which Mr. Ketchum is president.</p>

<p>There is nothing left now but to
turn to the superintendent’s report,
in order to ascertain the number of
Catholic children who, for the last
fifty years, have suffered this “sentence
of exclusion” from their faith,
its duties, and its practices. We
are only enabled to form a proximate
idea of their number, but sufficiently
accurate to serve our purpose.
The superintendent’s figures
are as follows:</p>

<table summary="The superintendent’s figures">
  <tr>
    <td>Total number of children committed in fifty years,</td>
    <td class="tdr">15,791</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Of these, 12,545 were boys and
3,246 girls. The statistics for the
first four decades are more accurate
than for the last, and show the relative
percentage of the children of
native and foreign parents, as follows:</p>

<table summary="Percentage of children of native vs foreign parentage">

    <td>86⁴/₁₀</td>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>It will be seen from this that the
percentage of the entire number is
enormously in favor of the children
born of foreign parents. This is
only natural from a variety of reasons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
chief among which is that the
foreign-born population, including
their children in the first degree,
has, within the last half-century,
been vastly in excess of the native,
in this city particularly. Full statistics
of the various nationalities of
the children are only given for the
last year (1874). Of the 636 new
inmates received during the year,
a little more than half the number
(334) were of Irish parentage;
8 were French; 3 Italian; 1 Cuban.
All of these may be safely
set down as Catholics. There were
88 of German birth, of whom one-third,
following the relative statistics
of their nation, might be assumed
as of the Catholic faith. The remainder,
whom we are willing to set
down in bulk as non-Catholic, were
divided as to nationality as follows:</p>

<table summary="Non-Catholic nationalities">
  <tr>
    <td>American,</td>
    <td class="tdr">96</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>African,</td>
    <td class="tdr">35</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>English,</td>
    <td class="tdr">26</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jewish,</td>
    <td class="tdr">3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Scotch,</td>
    <td class="tdr">6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bohemian,</td>
    <td class="tdr">1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Welsh,</td>
    <td class="tdr">1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mixed,</td>
    <td class="tdr">34</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>At all events, figure as we may,
it may be taken as indisputable
that more than one-half the children
committed during the past
year to the House of Refuge were
of Catholic parents. Their average
age, according to the statistics, was
thirteen years and eight months.
Consequently, the children were
quite of an age to be capable of
distinguishing between creed and
creed, and six years beyond the average
age set down by the Catholic
Church as a proper time to begin to
frequent the sacraments of Confession
and Communion, to prepare for
Confirmation, and to hear Mass on
all Sundays and holydays of obligation,
under pain of mortal sin. From
the moment of their entering the
institution the “wise Christian philanthropy”
of which Mr. Edgar
Ketchum is so eloquent an exponent
has pronounced against them
a dread “sentence of exclusion”
from all these practices of faith and
means of grace, as well as from instruction
of any kind whatever in
their religion. And not only has
this been the case, but they have
been subjected to the constant instruction
of such men as Mr. Smyth
and Mr. Hallock. Multiply these
children throughout the last fifty
years, as far as the relative percentage
given will allow us to form an
opinion of their creeds, and the
picture that presents itself of these
poor little Catholics is one that
rends the heart. In the present article
we are only presenting the
general features of the case, basing
our argument for the admission of
a Catholic chaplain to this and all
similar institutions from which a
Catholic chaplain is excluded, on
the law of the land, on the letter
and spirit of the constitution, which
we Catholics love, revere, and obey.
We simply set the case in its barest
aspect before our fellow-citizens, of
whatever creed, and ask for our
children what they would claim
for their children&mdash;the right of instruction
in the religion in which
they were born; the right of the free
practice and profession of the religion
in which they believe; the
right to repel all coercion, in whatever
form, of conscience, whether
such coercion be called sectarian
or non-sectarian. In a word, we
ask now, as at the beginning, what
we ask for all, and what Catholics,
where they have the power, as already
seen, freely and without compulsion,
or request even, grant to
all&mdash;that great privilege and right
which the constitution of this State
guarantees to all mankind: “the
free exercise and enjoyment of religious
profession and worship, without
discrimination or preference.”</p>

<h3>THE VEIL WITHDRAWN.</h3>

<p class="center">TRANSLATED, BY PERMISSION, FROM THE FRENCH OF MME. CRAVEN, AUTHOR OF “A SISTER’S STORY,”
“FLEURANGE,” ETC.</p>

<p class="center">CONCLUDED.</p>

<h4>XLIV.</h4>

<p>This was the spring of the year
1859. In spite of the retirement in
which we lived and Lorenzo’s assiduous
labors, which deprived him of
the leisure to read even a newspaper,
the rumors of a war between Austria
and Italy had more than once reached
us and excited his anxiety&mdash;excited
him as every Italian was at that
period at the thought of seeing his
country delivered from the yoke of
the foreigner. On this point public
sentiment was unanimous, and many
people in France will now comprehend
better than they did at that
time, perhaps, a cry much more
sincere than many that were uttered
at a later day&mdash;the only one that
came from every heart: <i lang="it">Fuori i
Tedeschi</i>. But till the time, when the
realization of this wish became possible,
it was only expressed by those
who labored in secret to hasten its
realization; it seemed dormant among
others. Political life was forbidden
or impossible. An aimless, frivolous
life was only embraced with the more
ardor, and this state of things had
furnished Lorenzo with more than
one excuse at the time when he
snatched at a poor one.</p>

<p>I had often heard him express his
national and political opinions, aspirations,
and prejudices, but these
points had never interested me. I
loved Italy as it was. I thought it
beautiful, rich, and glorious. I did
not imagine anything could add to
the charm, past and present, which
nature, poetry, religion, and history
had endowed it with. From time to
time I had also heard a cry which
excited my horror, and conveyed to
my mind no other idea than a monstrous
national and religious crime:
<i lang="it">Roma capitale!</i> These words alone
roused me sufficiently from my indifference
to excite my indignation,
and even awakened in me a feeling
bordering on repugnance to all that
was then called the Italian <i lang="it">resorgimento</i>.</p>

<p>Stella did not, in this respect, agree
with me. It was her nature to be
roused to enthusiasm by everything
that gave proof of energy, courage,
and devotedness&mdash;traits that patriotism,
more or less enlightened, easily
assumes the seductive appearance of,
provided it is sincere. No one could
repeat with more expression than
she:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent12">“<em>Italia! Italia!</em> …</div>
<div class="verse">De’h fossi tu men bella! O almen piu forte!”<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Or the celebrated apostrophe of
Dante:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Ahi serva Italia! di dolore ostello!”<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Never did her talent appear to
better advantage than in the recitation
of such lines; her face would
light up and her whole attitude
change. Lorenzo often smilingly
said if he wished to represent the
poetical personification of Italy, he
would ask Stella to become his
model. As to what concerned Rome,
she did not even seem to comprehend
my anxiety. If a few madmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
already began to utter that ominous
cry, the most eminent Italians of the
time declared that to infringe on the
majesty of Rome, deprive her of the
sovereignty which left her, in a new
sense, her ancient title of queen of
the world&mdash;in short, to menace the
Papacy, “<i lang="fr">l’unique grandeur vivante
de l’Italie</i>,” would be to commit the
crime of treason against the world,
and uncrown Italy herself.</p>

<p>Alas! now that the time approached
for realizing some of her dreams
and the bitter deception of others,
Stella, absorbed in her grief, was
indifferent to all that was occurring
in her country, and did not even remark
the universal excitement around
her! As for me, who had always
taken so little interest in such things,
I was more unconcerned than ever,
and scarcely listened to what was
said on the subject in Mme. de
Kergy’s drawing-room. I was far
from suspecting I was about to be
violently roused from my state of indifference.</p>

<p>It was Easter Sunday. I had been
to church with Lorenzo. We had
fulfilled together the sweet, sacred
obligations of the day; the union of
our souls was complete, and our
hearts were at once full of joy and
solemnity&mdash;that is, in complete harmony
with the great festival. At our
return we found breakfast awaiting
us. Ottavia, who, with a single domestic,
had the care of our house,
had adorned the table with flowers,
as well as with a little more silver
than usual, in order to render it somewhat
more in accordance with the
importance of the day. By means
of colored-glass windows and some
old paintings suspended on the dark
wainscotting, Lorenzo had given our
little dining-room an aspect at once
serious and smiling, which greatly
pleased me, and I still remember the
feeling of happiness and joy with
which, on my return from church, I
entered the little room, the open window
of which admitted the sun and
the odor of the jasmine twined around
it. The three conditions of true happiness
we did not lack&mdash;order, peace,
and industry&mdash;and we were in that
cheerful frame of mind which neither
wealth, nor gratified ambition, nor
any earthly prosperity is able to impart.</p>

<p>We took seats at the table. Lorenzo
found before him a pile of letters
and newspapers, but did not attempt
to open them. He sat looking at
me with admiration and affection.
I, on my part, said to myself that
moral and religious influences had
not only a beneficial effect on the
soul, but on the outward appearance.
Never had Lorenzo’s face worn such
an expression; never had I been so
struck with the manly beauty of his
features. Our eyes met. He smiled.</p>

<p>“Ginevra mia!” said he, “in
truth, you are right. The life we now
lead must suit you, for you grow
lovelier every day.”</p>

<p>“Our life does not suit you less
than it does me, Lorenzo,” said I.
“We are both in our element now.
God be blessed! His goodness to
us has indeed been great!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he with sudden gravity,
“greater a thousand times than I
had any right to expect. I am really
too happy!”</p>

<p>This time I only laughed at his
observation, and tried to divert his
mind from the remembrances awakened.</p>

<p>“Where are your letters from?”</p>

<p>He tore one open, and his face
brightened.</p>

<p>“That looks well! Nothing could
suit me better. Here is an American
who wishes a repetition of my <cite>Sappho</cite>,
and gives me another order of importance.
And then what? He wishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
to purchase the lovely <cite>Vestal</cite> he saw
in my studio. Oh! as for that, <i lang="fr">par
exemple</i>, no!… The <cite>Vestal</cite> is mine,
mine alone. No one else shall ever
have it. But no matter, Ginevra; if
things go on in this way, I shall
soon be swimming in money, and
then look out for the diamonds!”</p>

<p>He knew now, as well as I, what
I thought of such things. He laughed,
and then continued to read his
letters.</p>

<p>“This is from Lando. It is addressed
to us both.”</p>

<p>He glanced over it:</p>

<p>“Their honeymoon at Paris is still
deferred. They cannot leave Donna
Clelia.”</p>

<p>After reading for some time in silence,
he said in an animated tone:</p>

<p>“This letter has been written
some time, and it seems there were
rumors of war on all sides at the
time, and poor Mariuccia, though
scarcely married to her German baron,
had to set out for her new home
much sooner than she expected.”</p>

<p>I listened to all this with mingled
indifference and distraction, when I
suddenly saw Lorenzo spring from
his seat with an exclamation of so
much surprise that I was eager to
know what had caused his sudden
excitement.</p>

<p>He had just opened a newspaper,
and read the great news of the
day: the Austrians had declared war
against Italy. The beginning of the
campaign was at hand.</p>

<p>Alas! my happy Easter was instantly
darkened by a heavy cloud!</p>

<p>Lorenzo seized his hat, and immediately
went out to obtain further
details concerning the affair, leaving
me sad and uneasy. Oh! how far
I lived from the agitations of great
political disturbances! How incapable
I was of comprehending them!
For a year my soul had been filled
with emotions as profound as they
were sweet. After great sufferings,
joys so great had been accorded me
that I felt a painful shrinking from
the least idea of any change. But
though the power of suffering was
still alive in my heart, all anxiety was
extinguished. Whatever way a dear
hand is laid on us, we never wish to
thrust it away. I remained calm,
therefore, though a painful apprehension
had taken possession of my
mind; and when Lorenzo returned,
two hours later, I was almost prepared
for what he had to communicate.</p>

<p>Yes, I knew it; he wished to go.
Every one in the province to which
his family belonged was to take part
in this war of independence. He
could not remain away from his brothers
and the other relatives and
friends who were to enroll themselves
in resisting a foreign rule.</p>

<p>“It is the critical moment. Seconded
by France, the issue cannot
be doubtful this time. You know I
have abhorred conspiracies all my life,
and my long journeys have served to
keep me away from those who would
perhaps have drawn me into them.
But now how can you wish me to
hesitate? How can you expect me
at such a time to remain inactive and
tranquil? You would be the first, I
am sure, to be astonished at such a
course, and I hope to find you now
both courageous and prompt to aid
me, for I must start without any delay.
You understand, my poor
Ginevra, before to-morrow I must be
on my way.”</p>

<p>He said all this and much more
besides. I neither tried to remonstrate
nor reply. I felt he was obeying
what he believed to be a call of
duty, and I could use no arguments
to dissuade him from it. What
could I do, then? Only aid him,
and bear without shrinking the unexpected
blow which had come like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
sudden tempest to overthrow the
edifice, but just restored, of my calm
and happy life!</p>

<p>The day passed sadly and rapidly
away. I was occupied so busily
that I scarcely had time for reflection.
But at last all I could do
was done, and Lorenzo, who had
gone out in the afternoon, found, on
returning at nightfall, that everything
was ready for his departure, which
was to take place that very night.</p>

<p>We sat down side by side on a
little bench against the garden-wall.
Spring-time at Paris is lovely also,
and everything was in bloom that
year on Easter Sunday. The air
even in Italy could not have been
sweeter nor the sky clearer. He
took my hand, and I leaned my
head against his shoulder. For
some minutes my heart swelled with
a thousand emotions I was unable
to express. I allowed my tears
to flow in silence. Lorenzo likewise
struggled to repress the agitation he
did not wish to betray, as I saw by
his trembling lips and the paleness
of his face.</p>

<p>I wiped my eyes and raised my
head.</p>

<p>“Lorenzo,” said I all at once,
“why not take me with you, instead
of leaving me here?”</p>

<p>“To the war?” said he, smiling.</p>

<p>“No, but to Italy. You could
leave me, no matter where. On the
other side of the Alps I should be
near you, and … should you have
need of me, I could go to you.”</p>

<p>He remained thoughtful for a moment,
and then said, as if speaking to
himself:</p>

<p>“Yes, should I be wounded, and
have time to see you again, it would
be a consolation, it is true.”</p>

<p>We became silent again, and I
awaited his decision with a beating
heart. Finally he said in a decided
tone:</p>

<p>“No, Ginevra, it cannot be. Remain
here. It is my wish. You
must.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked I, trying to keep
back the tears that burst from my
eyes at his reply&mdash;“why? Oh! tell
me why?”</p>

<p>“Because,” replied he firmly, “I
have no idea what will be the result
of the war in Italy. Very probably
it will cause insurrections everywhere,
perhaps revolutions.”</p>

<p>“O my God!” cried I with terror
… “and you expect me not
to feel any horror at this war!
Even if it had not come to overturn
my poor life, how can I help shuddering
at the thought of all the misery
it is about to produce?”</p>

<p>“What can you expect, Ginevra?
Yes, it is a serious affair. God alone
knows what it will lead to. You see
Mario writes Sicily is already a-flame.
No one can tell what will take place
at Naples. I should not be easy
about you anywhere but here.…
No, Ginevra, you cannot go. You
must remain here. I insist upon
it.”</p>

<p>I knew, from the tone in which he
said this, it was useless to insist, and
I bent my head in silence. He gently
continued, as he pressed my hand in
his:</p>

<p>“The war will be short, I hope,
Ginevra. If I am spared, I will hasten
to resume the dear life we have
led here. But if, on the contrary.…”</p>

<p>He stopped a moment, then, with
a sudden change of manner and an
accent I shall never forget, he continued:</p>

<p>“But why speak to you as I should
to any other woman? Why not
trust to the inward strength you possess,
which has as often struck me
as your sweetness of disposition? I
know now where your strength
comes from, and will speak to you
without any circumlocution.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>I looked at him with surprise at
this preamble, and by the soft evening
light I saw a ray of heaven in
his eyes; for they beamed with faith
and humility as he uttered the following
words:</p>

<p>“Why deceive you, Ginevra?
Why not tell you I feel this is the
last hour we shall ever pass together
in this world?”</p>

<p>I shuddered. He put his arm
around my waist, and drew me towards
him.</p>

<p>“No, do not tremble!… Listen
to me.… If I feel I am to die,
I have always thought a life like
mine required some other expiation
besides repentance. The happiness
you have afforded me is not one, and
who knows if its continuation might
not become a source of danger to
me? Whereas to die now would be
something; it would be a sacrifice
worthy of being offered … and
accepted.”</p>

<p>My head had again fallen on his
shoulder, and my heart beat so rapidly
I was not able to reply.</p>

<p>“Look upward, Ginevra,” said he
in a thrilling tone; “raise your eyes
towards the heaven you have taught
me to turn to, to desire, and hope
for. Tell me we shall meet there
again, and there find a happiness no
longer attended by danger!”</p>

<p>Yes, at such language I felt the
inward strength he had spoken of assert
itself, after seeming to fail me,
and this terrible, painful hour became
truly an hour of benediction.</p>

<p>“Lorenzo,” said I in a tone which,
in spite of my tears, was firm, “yes,
you are right, a thousand times right.
Yes, whatever be your fate and mine,
let us bless God!… We are happy
without doubt; but our present life,
whatever its duration, is only a short
prelude to that true life of infinite
happiness which awaits us. Let God
do as he pleases with it and with us!
Whatever be the result, there is no
adieu for us.”</p>

<p>Do I mean to say that the sorrow
of parting was extinguished? Oh!
no, assuredly not. We tasted its
bitterness to the full, but there is a
mysterious savor which is only revealed
to the heart that includes all
in its sacrifice, and refuses nothing.
This savor was vouchsafed us at that
supreme hour, and we knew and felt
it strengthened our souls.</p>

<h4>XLV.</h4>

<p>The two weeks that succeeded this
last evening seem, as I look back
upon them, like one long day of expectation.
Nothing occurred to relieve
my constant uneasiness. A few
lines from Lorenzo, written in haste
as he was on the point of starting to
join the army, where the post of
aide-de-camp to one of the generals
had been reserved for him, were the
last direct news I received. From
that day I had no other information
but what I gathered from the newspapers,
or what Mme. de Kergy and
Diana obtained from their friends,
who, though most of them were unfavorable
to the war in which France
was engaged, felt an ardent interest
in all who took part in it. But there
were only vague, confused reports,
which, far from calming my agitation,
only served to increase it.</p>

<p>One evening I remained later than
usual at church. Prostrate before
one of the altars, which was lit up
with a great number of tapers, I
could not tear myself away, though
night had come and the church was
almost deserted. It was one of those
dark, painful hours when the idea of
suffering fills us with fear and repugnance,
and rouses every faculty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
our nature to resist it; one of those
hours of mortal anguish that no human
being could support had there
not been a day&mdash;a day that will endure
as long as the world&mdash;when this
agony was suffered by Him who wished
us to participate in it in order that
he might be for ever near us when we,
in our turn, should have to endure it
for him!…</p>

<p>Oh! in that hour I felt in how
short a time I had become attached
to the earthly happiness that had
been granted me beyond the realization
of my utmost wishes. What
tender, ardent sentiments! What
sweet, delightful communings already
constituted a treasure in my memory
which furnished material for the most
fearful sacrifice I could be called
upon to make! Alas! the human
heart, even that to which God has
deigned to reveal himself, still attaches
itself strongly to all it is permitted
to love on earth! But this
divine love condescends to be jealous
of our affection, and it is seldom he
spares such hearts the extreme sacrifices
which lead them to give themselves
to him at last without any reserve!</p>

<p>When I left the church, I saw a
crowd in the street. Several houses
were illuminated, and on all sides I
heard people talking of a great victory,
the news of which had just arrived
at Paris.</p>

<p>I returned home agitated and troubled.
At what price had this victory
been won? Who had fallen in the
battle? What was I to hear? And
when would the anguish that now
contracted my heart be relieved
… or justified? Mme. de Kergy,
who hastened to participate in my
anxiety, was unable to allay it. But
our suspense was not of long duration.
The hour, awaited with the fear of
an overpowering presentiment, was
soon to arrive!…</p>

<p>Two days after I was sitting in
the evening on the little bench in
the garden where we held our last
conversation, when I received the news
for which he had so strangely prepared
me. His fatal prevision was realized.
He was one of the first victims of
the opening attack. His name, better
known than many others, had been
reported at once, and headed the list
of those who fell in the battle.</p>

<p class="break">No preparation, no acceptation
of anticipated misfortune, no effort
at submission or courage, was now
able to preserve me from a shock
similar to the one I have related the
effects of at the beginning of this
story. As on that occasion, I lost
all consciousness, and Ottavia carried
me senseless to my chamber.
As then, likewise, I was for several
days the prey to a burning fever,
which was followed by a weakness
and prostration that rendered my
thoughts confused and incoherent
for some time. And finally, as
when I was but fifteen years old, it
was also a strong, sudden emotion
that helped restore my physical
strength and the complete use of my
senses and reason.</p>

<p>The most profound silence reigned
in the chamber where I lay, but
I felt I was surrounded by the tenderest
care. At length I vaguely
began to recognize voices around
me; first, that of Ottavia, which
made me shed my first tears&mdash;tears
of emotion, caused by a return to the
days of my childhood. I thought
myself there again. I forgot everything
that had happened since. But
this partial relief restored lucidness
to my mind, and with it a clear
consciousness of the misfortune that
had befallen me. Then I uttered a
cry&mdash;a cry that alarmed my faithful
nurse. But I had the strength to
reassure her at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let me weep, Ottavia,” said I
in a low tone&mdash;“I know, … I
recollect. Do not be alarmed; I am
better, Ottavia. God be blessed, I
can pray!”</p>

<p>I said no more, and closed my
eyes. But a little while after I reopened
them, and eagerly raised my
head. What did I hear? Mme.
de Kergy and Diana were there.
I recognized their voices, and
now distinguished their faces. But
whose voice was that which had
just struck my ear? Whose sweet
face was that so close to mine?
Whose hand was that I felt the pressure
of?</p>

<p>“O my Stella!” I cried, “is it a
dream, or are you really here?” …</p>

<h4>XLVI.</h4>

<p>No, it was not a dream. It was
really Stella, who had torn herself
from her retreat, her solitude and
her grief, and hastened to me as
soon as she heard of the fresh blow
that had befallen me. She had not
ceased to interest herself in all that
concerned my new life, and the distant
radiance of my happiness had
been the only joy of her wounded
heart. Now this happiness was suddenly
destroyed.… I was far
away; I was in trouble; I was
alone; the state of affairs, which became
more and more serious, detained
my brother in Sicily; but she
was free&mdash;free, alas! from every tie,
from every duty, and she came to
me as fast as the most rapid travelling
could bring her. But when she
arrived, I was unable to recognize
her, and, when I now embraced her,
she had watched more than a week
at my bedside!</p>

<p>This was the sweetest consolation&mdash;the
greatest human assistance
heaven could send me, and it was a
benefit to both of us. For each it
was beneficial to have the other to
think of.</p>

<p>My health now began to improve,
and my soul recovered its serenity.
I felt a solemn, profound peace,
which could not be taken from me,
and which continually increased; but
this did not prevent me from feeling
and saying with sincerity that everything
in this world was at an end for
me.</p>

<p>Yes, everything was at an end;
but I resigned myself to my lot, and
when, after this new affliction, I
found myself before the altar where
I prayed that evening with so many
gloomy forebodings, I fell prostrate,
as, after some severe combat or long
journey, a child falls exhausted on
the threshold of his father’s house, to
which he returns never to leave it
again!</p>

<p>If I had then obeyed my natural
impulse, I should have sought some
place of profound seclusion, where I
could live, absorbed and lost in the
thought continually present to my
mind since the great day of grace
which enabled me to comprehend
the words: <em>God loves me!</em> and to
which I could henceforth add: And
whom alone I now love!</p>

<p>But it is seldom the case one’s natural
inclinations can be obeyed, especially
when they incline one to
a life of inaction and retirement.
There is but little repose on earth,
and the more we love God, the less
it is permitted to sigh after it. I
was forced to think of others at this
time, and, above all, of the dear, faithful
friend who had come so far to
console me.</p>

<p>It did not require a long time for
Mme. de Kergy to discern the heroic
greatness of Stella’s character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and still less for her maternal heart,
that had received so many blows, to
sympathize with the broken heart of
Angiolina’s mother. The affection
she at once conceived for Stella was
so strong that I might have been almost
jealous, had it not exactly realized
one of my strongest desires,
and had not Mme. de Kergy been
one of those persons whose affection
is the emanation of a higher love
which is bestowed on all, without allowing
that which is given to the
latest comer to diminish in the least
the part of the others.</p>

<p>She at once perceived the remedy
that would be efficacious to her
wounded heart, and what would be
a beneficial effort for mine, and she
threw us both, if I may so express
myself, into that ocean of charity
where all personal sufferings, trials,
and considerations are forgotten, and
where peace is restored to the soul by
means of the very woes one encounters
and succeeds in relieving.</p>

<p>No fatigue, no fear of contagion,
the sight of no misery, affected Stella’s
courage; no labor wearied her patience,
no application or effort was
beyond her ability and perseverance.
For souls thus constituted it is a
genuine pleasure to exercise their
noble faculties and be able to satisfy
the thirst for doing good that
devours them. Her eyes, therefore,
soon began to brighten, her face to
grow animated, and from time to
time, like a reflection of the past, her
lips to expand with the charming
smile of former days.</p>

<p>There is a real enjoyment, little
suspected by those who have not experienced
it, in these long, fatiguing
rounds, the endless staircases ascended
and descended, in all these duties
at once distressing and consoling,
and it can be truly affirmed that
there is more certainty of cheerfulness
awaiting those who return home
from these sad visits than the happiest
of those who come from some
gay, brilliant assembly. It is to the
former the words of S. Francis de
Sales may be addressed: “Consider
the sweetest, liveliest pleasures that
ever delighted your heart, and say if
there is one worth the joy you now
taste.…”</p>

<p>Thus peace and a certain joy returned
by degrees, seconded by the
sweetest, tenderest, most beneficial
sympathy. Notwithstanding the solitude
in which we lived, and the
mourning I never intended to lay
aside, and which Stella continued to
wear, we spent an hour every evening
at Mme. de Kergy’s, leaving
when it was time for her usual circle
to assemble. This hour was a pleasant
one, and she depended on seeing
us, for she began to cling to our
company. Diana, far from being
jealous, declared we added to the
happiness of their life; and one day,
in one of her outbursts of caressing
affection, she exclaimed that the good
God had restored to her mother the
two daughters she had mourned for
so long.</p>

<p>At these words Mme. de Kergy’s
eyes filled with tears, which she hastily
wiped away, and, far from contradicting
her daughter, she extended
her arms and held us both in a
solemn, tender, maternal embrace!</p>

<h4>XLVII.</h4>

<p>What Stella felt at that moment I
cannot say. As for me, my feelings
were rather painful than pleasant.
I comprehended only too well the
sadness that clouded the dear, venerable
brow of Gilbert’s mother, and
his prolonged absence weighed on
my heart like remorse. Of course I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
did not consider myself the direct
cause. But I could not forget that
he merely left his country for a few
weeks, and it was only after his sojourn
at Naples he had taken the
sudden resolution to make almost
the tour of the world&mdash;that is, a journey
whose duration was prolonged
from weeks into months, and from
months into years. I felt that no
joy could spring up on the hearth
he had forsaken till the day he
should return, and it seemed to me I
should not dare till that day arrived
enjoy the peace that had been restored
to my soul.</p>

<p>Months passed away, however,
autumn came for the second time
since Stella’s arrival, and the time
fixed for her departure was approaching.
I had made up my mind to
accompany her, and pass some time
at Naples with her, in order to be
near my sister; but various unforeseen
events modified her plans as
well as mine.</p>

<p>I went one day to the Hôtel de
Kergy at a different hour from that I
was in the habit of going. Diana
and her mother had gone out. I
was told they would return in an
hour. I decided, therefore, to wait,
and, as the weather was fine, I selected
a book from one of the tables
of the drawing-room, and took a
seat in the garden.</p>

<p>While I was looking over the
books, my attention was attracted to
several letters that lay on the table
awaiting Mme. de Kergy’s return,
and, to my great joy, I recognized
Gilbert’s writing on one of them.
His long absence had this time been
rendered more painful by the infrequency
and irregularity of his letters.
Whole months often elapsed without
the arrival of any. I hoped this one
had brought his mother the long-wished-for
promise of his return, and
cheered by this thought, I opened my
book, which soon absorbed me so
completely that I forgot my anxiety,
and hope, and everything else.…</p>

<p>The book I held in my hand was
the <cite>Confessions of S. Augustine</cite>, and,
opening it at hazard, the passage on
which my eyes fell was this:</p>

<p>“What I know, not with doubt, but
with certainty; what I know, O my
God! is that I love thee. Thy word
penetrated my heart and suddenly
caused it to love thee. The heavens
and the earth, and all they contain, do
they not cry without ceasing that all
men should love thee? But he on
whom it pleaseth thee to have
mercy alone can comprehend this language.”<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>O words, ancient but ever new,
like the beauty itself that inspired
them! What a flight my soul took
as I read them again here in this
solitude and silence. Though centuries
had passed since the day they
were written, how exactly they expressed,
how faithfully they portrayed,
the feelings of my heart!
How profound was the conviction I
felt, in my turn, that, without the
mercy and compassion of God, I
should never have been able to understand
their meaning!</p>

<p>I was deeply, deeply plunged in
these reflections, I was lost in a world,
not of fancy, but of reality more delightful
than a poet’s dreams, when
an unusual noise brought me suddenly
to myself. First I heard the rattling
of a carriage which I supposed
to be Mme. de Kergy’s. But I
instantly saw two or three servants
rush into the court, as if some unexpected
event had occurred. Then
the old gardener, at work in the
parterre before me, suddenly threw
down his watering-pot and uttered a
cry of surprise and joy:</p>

<p>“O goodness of God!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
he in a trembling voice, “there is
Monsieur le Comte!”</p>

<p>“Monsieur le Comte?” cried I,
hastily rising.…</p>

<p>But I had not time to finish my
question. It was really he&mdash;Gilbert.
He was there before me, on the upper
step of the flight that led to the
drawing-room. I sprang towards
him with a joy I did not think of
repressing or concealing, and, extending
both hands, I exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh! God be blessed a thousand
times. It is you! You have returned!
What a joyful surprise for
your mother! For Diana! For me
also, I assure you!…”</p>

<p>I know not what else I was on
the point of adding when, seeing
him stand motionless, and gaze at
me as if incapable of answering a
word, a faint blush rose to my face.
Was he surprised at such a greeting,
or too much agitated? Perchance
he was deceived as to its signification.
This doubt caused a sudden embarrassment,
and checked the words I
was about to utter.</p>

<p>At length he explained his unexpected
arrival. His letter ought to
have arrived before. He supposed
his mother was notified.… He
wished to spare her so sudden a surprise.…</p>

<p>“I knew you were at Paris,” continued
he, in a tone of agitation he
could not overcome. “Yes … I
knew it, and hoped to see you again.
But to find you here … to see you
the first, O madame! that was a
happiness too great for me to anticipate,
and I cannot yet realize it is
not, after all, a dream.…”</p>

<p>While he was thus speaking, and
gazing intently at me as if I were
some vision about to vanish from his
sight, my joyful greeting and cordiality
were changed into extreme gravity
of manner, and I looked away as
his eyes wandered from my face to
my mourning attire, and for the first
time it occurred to me he found me
free, and perhaps was now thinking
of it!</p>

<p>Free!… Oh! if I have succeeded
in describing the state of my
soul since that moment of divine
light which marked the most precious
day of my life; if I have clearly
expressed the aspect which the past,
the present, the future, and all the
joys, all the sufferings, in short, every
event of my life, henceforth took in
my eyes; if, I say, I have been able
to make myself understood, those
who have read these pages are already
aware what the word <em>free</em> now
signified to me.</p>

<p>Free! Yes, as the bird that cleaves
the air is free to return to its cage; as
the captive on his way to the shores
of his native land is free to return
and resume his chains; so is the
soul that has once tasted the blessed
reality of God’s love free also to
return to the vain dreams of earthly
happiness.</p>

<p>“I would not accept it!” was the
exclamation of a soul<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> that had thus
been made free, and it is neither
strange nor new. No more than
the bird or the captive could it be
tempted to return to the past.…</p>

<p class="break">I did not utter a word, however,
and the thoughts that came over me
like a flood died away in the midst
of the joyful excitement that put an
end to this moment of silence.
Mme. de Kergy and Diana, who
had been sent for, arrived pale and
agitated. But when I saw Gilbert
in his mother’s arms, I felt so happy
that I entirely forgot what had occurred,
and was not even embarrassed
when, as I was on the point of
leaving, I heard Diana say to her
brother that her mother had two new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
daughters now, and he would find
three sisters instead of one in the
house.</p>

<p>I returned home in great haste.
It was the first time for a long while
my heart had felt light. I searched
for Stella. She was neither in the
house nor garden. I then thought
of the studio, where, in fact, I found
her. Everything remained in the
same way Lorenzo had left it, and
Stella, who had a natural taste for
the arts, knew enough of sculpture
to devote a part of her time to it.
She had succeeded in making a bust
of Angiolina which was a good likeness,
and she was at work upon it
when I entered.</p>

<p>She looked at me with an air of
surprise, for she saw something unusual
had taken place.</p>

<p>“Gilbert has returned!” I exclaimed,
without thinking of preparing
her for the news, the effect of
which I had not sufficiently foreseen.</p>

<p>She turned deadly pale, and her
face assumed an expression I had
never known it to wear. I was utterly
amazed. Rising with an abrupt
movement, she said, in an altered
tone:</p>

<p>“Then I must go, Ginevra!” And,
suddenly bursting into tears, she
pressed her lips to the little bust,
the successful production of her
labor and grief.</p>

<p>“O my angel child!” said she,
“forgive me. I know it; I ought to
love no one but thee. I have been
punished, cruelly punished. And yet
I am not sure of myself, Ginevra.
I do not wish to see him again. I
must go.”</p>

<p>It was the first time in her life
Stella had thus allowed me to read
the depths of her heart. It was the
first time the violence of any emotion
whatever broke down the wall
of reserve she knew how to maintain,
and made her rise above her
natural repugnance to speak of herself.
It was the first time I was sure
of the wound I had so long suspected,
but which I had never ventured
to probe.</p>

<p>God alone knows with what emotion
I listened to her. What hopes
were awakened, and what prayers
rose from my heart during the moment’s
silence that followed these
ardent words. She soon continued,
with renewed agitation:</p>

<p>“Yes, I must start at once. I
had no idea he would arrive in this
way without giving me time to escape!…”</p>

<p>Then she added, in a hollow tone:</p>

<p>“Listen, Ginevra. For once I
must be frank with you. He loves
you, you well know, and now there
is nothing more to separate you;
now you are free.…”</p>

<p>But she stopped short, surprised,
I think, at the way in which I
looked at her.</p>

<p>“She also! Is it possible?” murmured
I, replying to my own
thoughts.</p>

<p>And my eyes, that had been fixed
on her, involuntarily looked upward
at the light that came from the only
window in the studio. I soon said
in a calm tone:</p>

<p>“You are mistaken, Stella. I am
not free, as you suppose. But let us
not speak of myself, I beg.…”</p>

<p>She listened without comprehending
me, and her train of thought, interrupted
for a moment, resumed its
course. I was far from wishing to
check a communicativeness her suffering
heart had more need of than
she was aware. I allowed her,
therefore, to pour out without hindrance
all that burdened her mind.
I suffered her to give way to her unreasonable
remorse. I did not even
contradict her when she repeated
that her sweet treasure would not
have been ravished from her, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
she been worthy of possessing it, if
no other love had been allowed to
enter her heart. I did not oppose
this fancy, which was only one of
those <i lang="fr">perfidies de l’amour</i>, as such
imaginary wrongs have been happily
styled, which, after the occurrence of
misfortune, often add to one’s actual
sorrow a burden still heavier and
more difficult to bear.</p>

<p>On the contrary, I assured her we
would start together, and she herself
should fix the day of our departure.</p>

<p>I only begged her not to hasten the
time, and, by leaving Paris so abruptly,
afflict our excellent friend at
the very hour of her joy, and make
Diana weep at the moment when she
was so pleased at the restoration of
their happiness. At last I induced
her to consent that things should remain
for the present as they were.
She would return to the Hôtel de
Kergy, and Gilbert’s return should
in no way change the way of life we
had both led for a year.</p>

<h4>XLVIII.</h4>

<p>Nothing, in fact, was changed.
Our morning rounds, our occupations
in the afternoon, and our evening reunions,
all continued the same as before.
Apparently nothing new had
occurred except the satisfaction and
joy which once more brightened the
fireside of our friends, and things
were pleasanter than ever, even when
Gilbert was present. This time he
seemed decided to put an end to his
wandering habits, and settle down
with his mother, never to leave her
again.</p>

<p>Nothing was changed, therefore.
And yet before the end of the year
I alone remained the same as the day
of Gilbert’s arrival, the day when
Stella was so desirous of going away
that she might not meet him again;
the day when (as I must now acknowledge)
he thought if he was deceived
by the pleasure I manifested
at seeing him again, if my sentiments
did not respond to his, if some new
insurmountable barrier had risen in
the place of that which death had removed,
then he would once more depart,
he would leave his country again,
he would exile himself from his
friends … and&mdash;who knows?&mdash;perhaps
die&mdash;yes, really, die of grief with
a broken heart!…</p>

<p>It was somewhat in these terms he
spoke to me some time after his return,
and I looked at him, as I listened,
with a strange sensation of surprise.
He was, however, the same
he once was, the same Gilbert whose
presence had afforded me so much
happiness and been such a source
of danger. There was no change in
the charm of his expression, his voice,
his wit, the elevation of his mind and
character, and yet … I tried, but
in vain, to recall the emotions of the
past I once found so difficult to hide,
so painful to combat, so impossible to
overcome. I could not revive the
dreams, the realization of which was
now offered me, and convince myself
it was I who had formerly regarded
such a destiny as so happy a
one and so worthy of envy&mdash;I, who
now found it so far below the satisfied
ambition of my heart. Ah! it
was a good thing for me to see Gilbert
again; it was well to look this
earthly happiness once more in the
face, in order to estimate the extent
the divine arrow had penetrated my
soul and opened the only true fountain
of happiness and love!</p>

<p>It was not necessary to give utterance
to all these thoughts. There
was something inexpressible in my
eyes, my voice, my language, my
tranquillity in his presence, in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
friendship itself, so evident and sincere,
which were more expressive
than any words or explanation, and
by degrees produced a conviction no
man can resist unless he is&mdash;which
Gilbert was not&mdash;blind, presumptuous,
or inflated with pride.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Amor, ch’ a null’ amato amar perdona,”<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">says our great poet. But he should
have added that, if this law is
not obeyed, love dies, and he who
loves soon grows weary of loving in
vain.</p>

<p>Gilbert was not an exception to
this rule. The time came for its accomplishment
in his case. The day
came when he realized it. It was a
slow, gradual, insensible process, but
at length I saw the budding, the
progress, the fulfilment of my dearest
hopes.</p>

<p>The “<i lang="fr">sang joyeux</i>” which once
enabled my dear Stella to endure the
trials of her earlier life now diffused
new joy and hope in her heart, brought
back to her eyes and lips that brilliancy
of color and intensity of expression
which always reflected the
emotions of her soul, and made her
once more what she was before her
great grief!…</p>

<p class="break">I saw her at last happy&mdash;happy to
a degree that had never before been
shed over her life. I should have
left her then, as I intended, to see
Livia again; but, while the changes I
have just referred to were taking
place around me, the heavy, unmerciful
hand of spoliation had been
laid on the loved asylum where my
sister hoped to find shelter for life.
Soldiers’ quarters were needed. The
monastery was appropriated, the
nuns were expelled. A greater trial
than exile was inflicted on their innocent
lives&mdash;a trial as severe as death,
and, in fact, was death to several of
their number. They were separated
from one another; the aged were
received in pious families; some
were dispersed in various convents
of their order still spared in Italy by
the act of suppression; others, again,
sought refuge in countries not then
affected by the tempest which, from
time to time, rises against the church
and strikes the religious orders as
lightning always strikes the highest
summits, without ever succeeding in
annihilating one, but leaving to the
persecutors the stigma of crime and
the shame of defeat!</p>

<p>My sister Livia was of the number
of these holy exiles. A convent of
her order, not far from Paris, was assigned
her as a refuge, and it was
there I had the joy of once more
seeing her calm, angelic face. How
much we had to say to each other!
How truly united we now were!
What a pleasure to again find her
attentive ear, her faithful heart, and
her courageous, artless soul! But
when, after the long account I had
to give her, I asked her to tell me, in
her turn, all she had suffered from
the sudden, violent invasion, the profanation
of a place so dear and sacred
to her, and the necessity of bidding
farewell to the cloudless heavens,
the beautiful mountains, and all the
enchanting scenery of the country
she loved, she smiled:</p>

<p>“What difference does all that
make?” said she. “Only one thing
is sad: that they who have wronged
us should have done us this injury.
As for us, the only real privation
there is they could not inflict on us;
the only true exile they could not
impose. <i lang="la">Domini est terra et plenitudo
ejus!</i> No human power can separate
us from him!”</p>

<p class="break">And now there remains but little
to add.</p>

<p>The happiness of this world, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
as it is, in all its fulness and its insufficiency,
Gilbert and Stella possess.
Diana also, without being
obliged to leave her mother, has
found a husband worthy of her and
the dear sanctuary of all that is
noble. Mario makes frequent journeys
to France to visit his sisters,
each in her retreat, and his former
asperities seem to grow less and less.
Lando and Teresina also come to see
me every time they visit Paris, and
I always find in him a sincere and
faithful friend; but it is very difficult
to convince him I shall never marry
again, and still more so to make him
understand how I can be happy.</p>

<p>Happy!… Nevertheless I am,
and truly so! I am happier than I
ever imagined I could be on earth;
and if life sometimes seems long, I
have never found it sad. Order,
peace, activity, salutary friendship, a
divine hope, leave nothing to be desired,
and like one<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> who, still young,
likewise arrived through suffering to
the clearest light, I said, in my turn:
Nothing is wanting, for “<em>I believe, I
love, and I wait!</em>”</p>

<p>Yes, I await the plenitude of that
happiness, a single ray of which sufficed
to transform my whole life. I
bless God for having unveiled the
profound mystery of my heart, and
enabled me to solve its enigma, and
to understand with the same clearness
all the aspirations of the soul
which constitute here below the
glory and torment of our nature! I
render thanks to him for being able
to comprehend and believe with assurance
that the reason why we are
so insatiable for knowledge, for
repose, for happiness, for love, for
security, and for so many other
blessings never found on earth to
the extent they are longed for,
is because “we are all created
<em>solely</em> for what we cannot here possess!”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<h3>CALDERON’S AUTOS SACRAMENTALES.<br />
<span class="smaller">I.</span></h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p>Villemain, in his <cite>Lectures on the
Literature of the Middle Ages</cite>, while
speaking of the Mysteries performed
by the <cite>Confrères de la Passion</cite>, exclaims,
“It is to be regretted that
at that period the French language
was not more fully developed, and
that there was no man of genius
among the <cite>Confrères de la Passion</cite>.</p>

<p>“The subject was admirable: imagine
a theatre, which the faith of
the people made the supplement of
their worship; conceive religion,
with the sublimity of its dogmas, put
on the stage before convinced spectators,
then a poet of powerful imagination,
able to use freely all
these grand things, not reduced to
the necessity of stealing a few tears
from us by feigned adventures, but
striking our souls with the authority
of an apostle and the impassioned
magic of an artist, addressing
what we believe and feel, and making
us shed real tears over subjects
which seem not only true, but divine&mdash;certainly
nothing would have
been greater than this poetry!”</p>

<p>Such a poet and such poetry
Spain possesses in Calderon and
his <cite>Autos Sacramentales</cite>, which may
be regarded as the completion and
perfection of the religious drama of
the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Of the modern nations which
possess a national popular drama,
Spain is the only one where, by the
side of the secular stage, there has
grown up and been carefully cultivated
a religious drama; for this, in
England, died with the Mysteries
and Moralities.</p>

<p>The persistence of the religious
drama in Spain is to be explained
by the peculiar history of the nation,
especially the struggle of centuries
with the Moors&mdash;a continual
crusade fought on their own soil,
which inflamed to the highest degree
the religious enthusiasm of
the people.</p>

<p>The Reformation awoke but a
feeble echo in Spain, and only served
to quicken the masses to greater
devotion to doctrines they saw
threatened from abroad.</p>

<p>The two dogmas of the church
which have always been especially
dear to the Spaniards are those of
the Immaculate Conception and
Transubstantiation.</p>

<p>The former, as more spiritual and
impalpable, remained an article of
faith, deep and fervent, only represented
to the senses by the mystic
masterpieces of Murillo. Transubstantiation,
on the other hand,
was embodied in a host of symbols
and ceremonies, and had devoted to
it the most gorgeous of all the festivals
of the church&mdash;that of Corpus
Christi, established in 1263 by Urban
IV., formally promulgated by
Clement V. in 1311, and fifty years
later amplified and rendered more
magnificent by John XXIII.</p>

<p>This festival was introduced into
Spain during the reign of Alfonso
X., and its celebration there, as
elsewhere, was accompanied by
dramatic representations.</p>

<p>In Barcelona, even earlier than
1314, part of the celebration consisted
in a procession of giants and
ridiculous figures&mdash;a feature, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
we shall afterwards see, always retained.</p>

<p>It seems established that from
the earliest date dramatic representations
of some kind always accompanied
the celebration of Corpus
Christi.</p>

<p>These plays, constituting a distinct
and peculiar class, received a
name of their own, and were at
first called <i lang="es">autos</i> (from the Latin
<i lang="la">actus</i>, applied to any particularly
solemn act, as <i lang="es">autos-da-fe</i>), and later
more specifically <i lang="es">autos sacramentales</i>.</p>

<p>We infer from occasional notices
that these religious dramas were
performed without interruption during
the XIVth and XVth centuries.
What their character was during this
period we do not know, as we possess
none earlier than the beginning
of the XVIth century.</p>

<p>From this last-named date notices
of the secular drama begin to
multiply, and we may form some
idea of the early <i lang="es">autos sacramentales</i>
from the productions of Juan de la
Enzina and Gil Vicente.</p>

<p>The former wrote a number of
religious dialogues or plays, which
he named <em>eclogues</em>, probably because
the majority of the characters were
shepherds.</p>

<p>One of these eclogues is on the
Nativity, another on the Passion
and Death of our Redeemer.</p>

<p>The word <i lang="es">auto</i>, as we have stated,
was applied to any solemn act, and
did not at first refer exclusively to
the Corpus Christi dramas, so we
find among the works of Gil Vicente
an <i lang="es">auto</i> for Christmas, and one on
the subject of S. Martin, which, although
having nothing to do with
the mystery of the Eucharist, was
performed during the celebration
of Corpus Christi in 1504, in the
vestibule of the Church of Las Caldas
in Lisbon.</p>

<p>These sacred plays were undoubtedly
at first represented only
in the churches by the ecclesiastics;
they were not allowed to be performed
in villages (where they could
not be supervised by the higher
clergy), or for the sake of money.</p>

<p>The abuses in their performance,
or perhaps the large number of
spectators, afterwards led to their
representation in the open air.</p>

<p>The stage (as in the beginning
of the classical drama) was a wagon,
on which the scenery was arranged;
when the <i lang="es">autos</i> became more elaborate,
three of these wagons or <i lang="es">carros</i>
were united.</p>

<p>We may see what these primitive
stages were like in <cite>Don Quixote</cite>
(part ii. chap. 11), the hero of
which encountered upon the highway
one of these perambulating
theatres:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He who guided the mules and served
for carter was a frightful demon. The
cart was uncovered and opened to the
sky, without awning or wicker sides.</p>

<p>“The first figure that presented itself
to Don Quixote’s eyes was that of Death
itself with a human visage. Close by him
sat an angel with painted wings. On
one side stood an emperor, with a crown,
seemingly of gold, on his head.</p>

<p>“At Death’s feet sat the god called
Cupid, not blindfolded, but with his bow,
quiver, and arrows.</p>

<p>“There was also a knight completely
armed, excepting only that he had no
morion or casque, but a hat with a large
plume of feathers of divers colors.</p>

<p>“With these came other persons, differing
both in habits and countenances.”</p>

</div>

<p>To Don Quixote’s question as to
who they were the carter replied:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Sir, we are strollers belonging to Angulo
el Malo’s company. This morning,
which is the octave of Corpus Christi,
we have been performing, in a village on
the other side of yon hill, a piece representing
the Cortes or Parliament of
Death, and this evening we are to play
it again in that village just before us;
which being so near, to save ourselves the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
trouble of dressing and undressing, we
come in the clothes we are to act our
parts in.”</p>

</div>

<p>The character of the <i lang="es">autos</i> changed
with the improvements in their
representation; from mere dialogues
they developed into short farces, the
object of which was to amuse while
instructing.</p>

<p>Like the secular plays, they opened
with a prologue, called the <i lang="es">loa</i>
(from <i lang="es">loar</i>, to praise), in which the
object of the play was shadowed
forth and the indulgence of the
spectators demanded.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es">loa</i> was originally spoken
by one person, and was also called
<i lang="es">argumento</i> or <i lang="es">introito</i>, and was in
the same metre as the <i lang="es">auto</i>; although
it consisted sometimes of a
few lines in prose, as in the <i lang="es">auto</i> of
<cite>The Gifts which Adam sent to Our
Lady by S. Lazarus</cite>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Loa.</span>&mdash;Here is recited an <i lang="es">auto</i> which
treats of a letter and gifts which our father
Adam sent by S. Lazarus to the illustrious
Virgin, Our Lady, supplicating
her to consent to the Passion of our Lord
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>“In order that the <i lang="es">auto</i> may be easily
heard, the accustomed silence is requested.”</p>

</div>

<p>Still later the <i lang="es">loa</i> was extended
into a short, independent play,
sometimes with no reference to the
<i lang="es">auto</i> it preceded, and frequently by
another author.</p>

<p>During Lope de Vega’s reign
over the Spanish stage an <i lang="es">entremes</i>
or farce was inserted between the
<i lang="es">loa</i> and <i lang="es">auto</i>.</p>

<p>These <i lang="es">entremeses</i> are gay interludes,
terminating with singing and
dancing, and having no connection
with the solemn play which follows,
unless, as is the case with one of
Lope de Vega’s (<cite>Muestra de los
Carros</cite>), to ridicule the whole manner
of celebrating the festival.</p>

<p>With the increase in wealth and
cultivation the performance of the
<i lang="es">autos</i> had lost much of its primitive
simplicity, and was attended with
lavish magnificence.</p>

<p>The proper representation of
these truly national works was deemed
of such importance that each city
had a committee, or <i lang="es">junta del corpus</i>,
consisting of the <i lang="es">corregidor</i> and two
<i lang="es">regidores</i> of the town, and a secretary.</p>

<p>This committee in Madrid was
presided over by a member of the
royal council (<i lang="es">Consejo y Cámera
real</i>) who was successively called
the “commissary, protector, and
superintendent of the festivals of
the Most Holy Sacrament.”</p>

<p>The president of the junta was
armed with extraordinary powers,
frequently exercised against refractory
actors. It was his duty to provide
everything necessary for the
festival: plays, actors, cars, masked
figures for the processions, decorations
for the streets, etc.</p>

<p>As there were at that date no
permanent theatrical companies in
the cities, it was necessary to engage
actors for the <i lang="es">autos</i> early in
the year, in order that there might
be no risk of failure, and to afford
the necessary time for rehearsals.</p>

<p>The necessary preparations having
been made, and an early Mass
celebrated, a solemn procession
took place, followed by the representation
of the <i lang="es">autos</i> in the open air.</p>

<p>The best descriptions of the manner
of representation are found in
the travels of two persons who witnessed
the performance of the <i lang="es">autos</i>
in Madrid in 1654 and 1679.</p>

<p>The second of the two was the
Comtesse d’Aulnoy, whose account
of her travels was always a popular
book.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The writer was a gossipy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
French lady, who disseminated
through Europe many groundless
scandals about the Spanish court.</p>

<p>Here are her own words about
the <i lang="es">autos</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As soon as the Holy Sacrament is
gone back to the church everybody goes
home to eat, that they may be at the <i lang="es">autos</i>,
which are certain kinds of tragedies
upon religious subjects, and are oddly
enough contrived and managed; they
are acted either in the court or street of
each president of a council, to whom it is
due.</p>

<p>“The king goes there, and all the persons
of quality receive tickets overnight
to go there; so that we were invited, and
I was amazed to see them light up abundance
of flambeaux, whilst the sun beat
full upon the comedians’ heads, and melted
the wax like butter. They acted the
most impertinent piece that I ever saw in
my days.… These <i lang="es">autos</i> last for a
month.…”</p>

</div>

<p>We shall see why the flippant Parisian
was shocked when we consider
the subject-matter of these plays.</p>

<p>The whole ceremony is much
better described by the earlier traveller,
Aarseus de Somerdyck, a
Dutchman, who was in Madrid in
1654.</p>

<p>His account is so long and minute
that we have been obliged to
condense it slightly:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The day opened with a procession,
headed by a crowd of musicians and Biscayans
with tambourines and castanets;
then followed many dancers in gay dresses,
who sprang about and danced as gayly
as though they were celebrating the
carnival.</p>

<p>“The king attended Mass at Santa
Maria, near the palace, and after the service
came out of the church bearing a
candle in his hand.</p>

<p>“The repository containing the Host
occupied the first place; then came the
grandees and different councils.</p>

<p>“At the head of the procession were
several gigantic figures made of pasteboard,
and moved by persons concealed
within. They were of various designs,
and some looked frightful enough; all
represented women, except the first, which
consisted only of an immense painted head
borne by a very short man, so that the
whole looked like a dwarf with a giant’s
head.</p>

<p>“There were besides two similar figures
representing a Moorish and an
Ethiopian giant, and a monster called the
<i lang="es">tarrasca</i>.</p>

<p>“This is an enormous serpent, with a
huge belly, long tail, short feet, crooked
claws, threatening eyes, powerful, distended
jaws, and entire body covered
with scales.</p>

<p>“Those who are concealed within cause
it to writhe so that its tail often knocks
off the unwary bystanders’ hats, and
greatly terrifies the peasants.</p>

<p>“In the afternoon, at five o’clock, the
<i lang="es">autos</i> were performed. These are religious
plays, between which comic interludes
are given to heighten and spice the solemnity
of the performance.</p>

<p>“The theatrical companies, of which
there are two in Madrid, close their theatres
during this time, and for a month
perform nothing but such religious plays,
which take place in the open air, on platforms
built in the streets.</p>

<p>“The actors are obliged to play every
day before the house of one of the presidents
of the various councils. The first
representation is before the palace, where
a platform with a canopy is erected for
their majesties.</p>

<p>“At the foot of this canopy is the theatre;
around the stage are little painted
houses on wheels, from which the actors
enter, and whither they retire at the end
of every scene.</p>

<p>“Before the performance the dancers
and grotesque figures amuse the public.</p>

<p>“During the representation lights were
burned, although it was day and in the
open air, while generally other plays are
performed in the theatres in the daytime
without any artificial light.”</p>

</div>

<p>Sufficient has now been said in
regard to the history and mode of
representation of the <i lang="es">autos</i> to enable
us to understand the essentially
popular character of these plays&mdash;a
fact very necessary to be kept in
mind, and which will explain, if not
palliate, the many abuses which
gradually were introduced, and
which led to their suppression by a
royal decree in 1765.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>They have, however, left traces
of their influence in plays still performed
on Corpus Christi in some
parts of Spain, and in the sacred
plays represented during Lent in
all the large cities.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>We have seen the primitive condition
of the <i lang="es">autos</i> when Lope de
Vega took possession of the stage.
He did for the <i lang="es">autos</i> what he did
for the secular drama: with his consummate
knowledge of the stage and
the public, he took the materials already
at hand, and remodelled them
to the shape most likely to interest
and win applause.</p>

<p>The superior poetic genius of
Calderon found in the <i lang="es">autos</i> the
field for its noblest exercise, and it
is now admitted that he carried the
secular as well as the religious drama
to the highest perfection of
which it was capable.</p>

<p>It is perhaps not generally remembered
that Calderon, in common
with many men of letters of
that day, took Holy Orders when he
was fifty-one years old (1651), and
was appointed chaplain at Toledo.</p>

<p>This, however, involved his absence
from court, and twelve years
later he was made chaplain of honor
to the king; other ecclesiastical
dignities were added, which he enjoyed
until the close of his life, in
1681.</p>

<p>Mr. Ticknor (<cite>Hist. of Span. Lit.</cite>,
ii. 351, note) says: “It seems probable
that Calderon wrote no plays
expressly for the public stage after
he became a priest in 1651, confining
himself to <i lang="es">autos</i> and to <i lang="es">comedias</i>
for the court, which last, however,
were at once transferred to the theatres
of the capital.”</p>

<p>For nearly thirty-seven years he
furnished Madrid, Toledo, Granada,
and Seville with <i lang="es">autos</i>, and devoted
to them all the energies of his
matured mind.</p>

<p>Solis, the historian, in one of his
letters says: “Our friend Don Pedro
Calderon is just dead, and went off,
as they say the swan does, singing;
for he did all he could, even when
he was in immediate danger, to finish
the second <i lang="es">auto</i> for Corpus
Christi.</p>

<p>“But, after all, he completed
only a little more than half of it,
and it has been finished in some
way or other by Don Melchior de
Leon.”</p>

<p>Calderon evidently based his claim
for recognition as a great poet on
his <i lang="es">autos</i>; of all his plays he deemed
them alone worthy of his revision
for publication, and he would now
without doubt be judged by them,
had not the spirit in which and for
which they were written passed
away, to a great extent, with the
author.</p>

<p>Before we examine his <i lang="es">autos</i> in
detail we must notice some of their
most striking peculiarities, and see
in what respect they differ from
plays on religious subjects.</p>

<p>The intensely religious character
of the Spaniards led, at an early
date, to their consecrating to religion
every form of literature; and
plays based on the lives of the saints,
miracles of the Blessed Virgin, etc.,
are very common.</p>

<p>Almost every prominent doctrine
of the church is illustrated in the
dramas of Lope de Vega and Calderon.</p>

<p>Their plays differ not at all in
<em>form</em> from those of a purely secular
character; they are all in three acts,
in verse.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es">autos</i>, on the other hand, are
restricted to the celebration of one
doctrine&mdash;that of Transubstantiation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
consist of but one act (that one,
however, nearly equal in length to
the three of many secular plays);
and were performed on but one solemn
occasion&mdash;the festival of Corpus
Christi.</p>

<p>The most striking peculiarity of
the <i lang="es">autos</i> consists in the introduction
of <em>allegorical</em> characters, which,
however, were not first brought before
the public in <i lang="es">autos</i>, nor was
their use restricted to that class of
dramatic compositions.</p>

<p>The custom of personifying inanimate
objects is as old as the imagination
of man, and has been constantly
used since the days of Job
and David; and Cervantes, in his
interesting drama, <cite>Numancia</cite>, introduces
“a maiden who represents
Spain,” and “the river Douro.”</p>

<p>It is not easy to see how the introduction
of allegorical personages
could have been avoided.</p>

<p>The leading idea in all the <i lang="es">autos</i>
is the redemption of the human
soul by the personal sacrifice of the
Son of God&mdash;that great gift of himself
to us embodied in the doctrine
of the Real Presence.</p>

<p>The plot is the history of the
soul from its innocence in Eden to
its temptation and fall, and subsequent
salvation; the characters
are the soul itself, represented by
human nature, the Spouse Christ,
the tempter, the senses, the various
virtues and vices.</p>

<p>These constitute but a small
minority of the whole number, as
will be seen by the following list,
which might easily be expanded:</p>

<p>God Almighty as Father, King,
or Prince, Omnipotence, Wisdom,
Divine Love, Grace, Righteousness,
Mercy; Christ as the Good Shepherd,
Crusader, etc., the Bridegroom&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
Christ, who woos his
bride, the Church&mdash;the Virgin, the
Devil or Lucifer, Shadow as a
symbol of guilt, Sin, Man as Mankind,
the Soul, Understanding, Will,
Free-will, Care, Zeal, Pride, Envy,
Vanity, Thought (generally, from
its fickleness, as Clown), Ignorance,
Foolishness, Hope, Comfort, the
Church, the written and natural
Law, Idolatry, Judaism or the
Synagogue, the Alcoran or Mahometanism,
Heresy, Apostasy, Atheism,
the Seven Sacraments, the
World, the four quarters of the
globe, Nature, Light symbol of
Grace, Darkness, Sleep, Dreams,
Death, Time, the Seasons and
Days, the various divisions of the
world, the four elements, the plants
(especially the wheat and vine, as
furnishing the elements for the
Holy Eucharist), the five Senses,
the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles
and their symbols (the eagle of
John, etc.), and the Angels and
Archangels.</p>

<p>Anachronisms are not regarded,
and the prophets and apostles appear
side by side on the same stage.</p>

<p>Although the plot was essentially
always the same, its development
and treatment were infinitely
varied.</p>

<p>The protagonist is Man, but under
the most diversified forms,
from abstract man to Psyche or
Eurydice, representatives of the
human soul.</p>

<p>The essential idea of man’s fall
and salvation is entwined with all
manner of subjects taken from history,
mythology, and romance.</p>

<p>The first contributed <cite>The Conversion
of Constantine</cite>, the second a
host of plays like <cite>The Divine Jason</cite>,
<cite>Cupid and Psyche</cite>, <cite>Andromeda
and Perseus</cite>, <cite>The Divine Orpheus</cite>,
<cite>The True God Pan</cite>, <cite>The Sacred
Parnassus</cite>, <cite>The Sorceries of Sin</cite>
(Ulysses and Circe). Romance
contributed the fables of <cite>Charlemagne
and the Twelve Peers</cite>, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>It is almost needless to say that
the most important sources of the
<i lang="es">autos</i> are the Scriptures and Biblical
traditions.</p>

<p>Examples of the former are: <cite>The
Brazen Serpent</cite>, <cite>The First and Second
Isaac</cite>, <cite>Baltassar’s Feast</cite>, <cite>The
Vineyard of the Lord</cite> (S. Matt. xx.
1). <cite>Gedeon’s Fleece</cite>, <cite>The Faithful
Shepherd</cite>, <cite>The Order of Melchisedech</cite>,
<cite>Ruth’s Gleaning</cite>, etc.</p>

<p>An interesting example of the
use of tradition is the <i lang="es">auto</i> of <cite>The
Tree of the Best Fruit</cite> (<cite>El Arbol
del Mejor Fruto</cite>), embodying the
legend that the cross on which
Christ died was produced from
three seeds of the tree of the forbidden
fruit planted on the grave
of Adam. There yet remains a
large number of plays which cannot
be referred to any of the above-mentioned
classes.</p>

<p>These are the inventions of the
poet’s brain, some of them but a
recast of secular plays already popular;<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
others are fresh creations,
and are among the most interesting
of the autos. Among these are
<cite>The Great Theatre of the World</cite> (<cite>El
Gran Teatro del Mundo</cite>, partly
translated by Dean Trench), <cite>The
Poison and the Antidote</cite> (<cite>El Veneno
y la Triaca</cite>, partly translated by
Mr. MacCarthy), etc.</p>

<p>No idea, however, can be formed
of the <i lang="es">autos</i> from a mere statement
of their form and subjects; they
must be examined in their entirety,
and the reader must transport himself
back to the spirit of the times
in which they were written.</p>

<p>What this spirit was, and how
the <i lang="es">autos</i> are to be regarded, is admirably
expressed by Schack, in his
<cite>History of the Spanish Drama</cite> (iii.
p. 251), and of which Mr. MacCarthy
has given the following spirited
translation:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Posterity cannot fail to participate in
the admiration of the XVIIth century for
this particular kind of poetry, when it
shall possess sufficient self-denial to
transplant itself out of the totally different
circle of contemporary ideas into the
intuition of the world, and the mode of
representing it, from which this entire
species of drama has sprung. He who
can in this way penetrate deeply into the
spirit of a past century will see the wonderful
creations of Calderon’s <i lang="es">autos</i> rise
before him, with sentiments somewhat
akin to those of the astronomer, who
turns his far-reaching telescope upon the
heavens, and, as he scans the mighty
spaces, sees the milky-way separating into
suns, and from the fathomless depths
of the universe new worlds of inconceivable
splendor rising up.</p>

<p>“Or let me use another illustration:
he may feel like the voyager who, having
traversed the wide waste of waters, steps
upon a new region of the earth, where he
is surrounded by unknown and wonderful
forms&mdash;a region which speaks to him
in the mysterious voices of its forests
and its streams, and where other species
of beings, of a nature different from any
he has known, look out wonderingly at
him from their strange eyes.</p>

<p>“Indeed, like to such a region these
poems hem us round.</p>

<p>“A temple opens before us, in which,
as in the Holy Graal Temple of Titurel,
the Eternal Word is represented symbolically
to the senses.</p>

<p>“At the entrance the breath as if of the
Spirit of eternity blows upon us, and a
holy auroral splendor, like the brightness
of the Divinity, fills the consecrated dome.</p>

<p>“In the centre, as the central point of
all being and of all history, stands the
cross, on which the infinite Spirit has
sacrificed himself from his infinite benevolence
towards man.</p>

<p>“At the foot of this sublime symbol
stands the poet as hierophant and prophet,
who explains the pictures upon the
walls, and the dumb language of the
tendrils, and the flowers that are twining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
round the columns, and the melodious
tones which reverberate in music from
the vault.</p>

<p>“He waves his magic wand, and the
halls of the temple extend themselves
through the immeasurable; a perspective
of pillars spreads from century to century
up to the dark gray era of the past, where
first the fountain of life gushes up, and
where suns and stars, coming forth from
the womb of nothing, begin their course.</p>

<p>“And the inspired seer unveils the
secrets of creation, showing to us the
breath of God moving over the chaos,
as he separates the solid earth from the
waters, points out to the moon and the
stars their orbits, and commands the
elements whither they should fly and
what they are to seek.</p>

<p>“We feel ourselves folded in the wings
of the Spirit of the universe, and we hear
the choral jubilation of the new-born
suns, as they solemnly enter on their
appointed paths, proclaiming the glory
of the Eternal.</p>

<p>“From the dusky night, which conceals
the source of all things, we see the procession
of peoples, through the ever-renewing
and decaying generations of men,
following that star that led the wise men
from the east, and advancing in their
pilgrimage towards the place of promise;
but beyond, irradiated by the splendors
of redemption and reconciliation, lies the
future, with its countless generations of
beings yet unborn.</p>

<p>“And the sacred poet points all round
to the illimitable, beyond the boundaries
of time out into eternity, shows the relation
of all things, created and uncreated,
to the symbol of grace, and how all
nations look up to Him in worship.</p>

<p>“The universe in its thousand-fold
phenomena, with the chorus of all its
myriad voices, becomes one sublime
psalm to the praise of the Most Holy;
heaven and earth lay their gifts at his
feet; the stars, ‘the never-fading flowers
of heaven,’ and the flowers, ‘the transitory
stars of earth,’ must pay him tribute;
day and night, light and darkness, lie
worshipping before him in the dust, and
the mind of man opens before him its
most hidden depths, in order that all its
thoughts and feelings may become transfigured
in the vision of the Eternal.</p>

<p>“This is the spirit that breathes from
the <i lang="es">autos</i> of Calderon upon him who can
comprehend them in the sense meant by
the poet.”</p>

</div>

<p>With this preparation we can
now examine in detail one or two
of the most characteristic of Calderon’s
<i lang="es">autos</i>, selecting from the
class of Scriptural subjects <cite>Baltassar’s
Feast</cite>, and from the large
class of allegories invented by the
poet the <cite>Painter of his own Dishonor</cite>,
which is of especial interest,
as being the counterpart of a secular
play.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Those who desire a better
acquaintance with Calderon’s
<span class="smcap">autos</span> than they can form from the
above very imperfect sketch and
analyses will find the following list
of authorities of interest:</p>

<p>The <i lang="es">autos</i> were not collected and
published until some time after the
poet’s death, in 1717, six vols.
4to, and 1759-60, six vols., also in
4to, both editions somewhat difficult
to find. In 1865 thirteen were
published in Riradeneyra’s collection
of Spanish authors in a work
entitled <cite>Autos Sacramentales desde
su origen hasta fines del siglo</cite> XVII.,
with an historical introduction by
the collector, Don Eduardo G. Pedroso.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es">autos</i> have never been republished,
in the original, out of
Spain.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm in regard to the
Spanish drama aroused by Schlegel’s
<cite>Lectures</cite>, early in this century,
bore fruit in a large number of excellent
German translations of the
most celebrated secular plays.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es">autos</i> were neglected until
1829, when Cardinal Diepenbrock
published a translation of <cite>Life is a
Dream</cite> (counterpart of comedy of
same name); this was followed in
1846-53 by <cite>Geistliche Schauspiele</cite>, von
Calderon (Stuttgart, two volumes),
containing eleven <i lang="es">autos</i> translated
by J. von Eichendorff, a writer well
known in other walks of literature.
In this translation the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
metre is preserved, and they are in
every way worthy of admiration.</p>

<p>In 1856 Ludwig Braunfels published
two volumes of translations
from Lope de Vega, Iviso de Molina,
and Calderon; the second volume
contains the <i lang="es">auto</i> of <cite>Baltassar’s
Feast</cite>.</p>

<p>In 1855 Dr. Franz Lorinser, an
ecclesiastic of Regensburg, an enthusiastic
admirer of Spanish literature,
began the translation of all
of Calderon’s <i lang="es">autos</i>, and has now
translated some sixty-two of the
seventy-two into German trochaic
verse, without any attempt to preserve
the original <i lang="es">asonante</i>.</p>

<p>This translation is accompanied
by valuable notes and explanations,
very necessary for the non-Catholic
reader, as these plays are in many
instances crowded with scholastic
theology.</p>

<p>If the Germans, with their genius
for translation, shrank from the
labor necessary for the faithful
rendering of the <i lang="es">autos</i>, the English,
with their more unmanageable language,
may well be excused for suffering
these remarkable plays to remain
so long unknown.</p>

<p>Occasional notices and analyses
had been given in literary histories
and periodicals, but the first attempt
at a metrical translation was
by Dean Trench in his admirable
little work (reprinted in New York
1856) on Calderon, which contains a
partial translation of <cite>The Great
Theatre of the World</cite>.</p>

<p>It is needless to say it is beautifully
done, and on the whole is the
most poetical translation yet made
into English.</p>

<p>The first complete translation of
an <i lang="es">auto</i> was made by Mr. D. F.
MacCarthy, published in 1861 in
London, under the title, <cite>Three
Dramas of Calderon, from the Spanish</cite>,
and containing the <i lang="es">auto</i>, <cite>The
Sorceries of Sin</cite>.</p>

<p>The author was favorably known
for his previous labors in this field,
which had won him the gratitude
of all interested in Spanish literature.</p>

<p>He has since published a volume,
entitled <cite>Mysteries of Corpus Christi</cite>,
Dublin and London, 1867, containing
complete translations of <cite>Baltassar’s
Feast</cite>, <cite>The Divine Philothea</cite>,
and several scenes from <cite>The Poison
and the Antidote</cite>, in all of which the
original metre is strictly preserved.
There are few translations in the
English language where similar difficulties
have been so triumphantly
overcome.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es">asonante</i> can never be naturalized
in English verse, but Mr.
MacCarthy has done much to reconcile
us to it, and make its introduction
in Spanish translations
useful, if not indispensably necessary.</p>

<p>It may be doubted whether in
any other way a correct idea of the
Spanish drama can be conveyed to
those unacquainted with the Spanish
language.</p>

<h3>ARE YOU MY WIFE?</h3>

<p class="center">BY THE AUTHOR OF “A SALON IN PARIS BEFORE THE WAR,” “NUMBER THIRTEEN,” “PIUS VI.,” ETC.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE LILIES.</span></h4>

<p>My first step was to pay a visit
to the Préfecture de Police. I was
received with the utmost courtesy
and many half-spoken, half-intimated
expressions of sympathy that
were touching and unexpected.
All that my sensitive pride most
shrank from in my misfortune was
ignored with a tact and delicacy
that were both soothing and encouraging.
I had felt more than
once, when exposing my miserable
and extraordinary situation to the
police agents at home, that it required
the strongest effort of professional
gravity on their part not to
burst out laughing in my face. No
such struggle was to be seen in the
countenances of the French police.
They listened with interest, real
or feigned, to my story, and invited
what confidence I had to give by
the matter-of-fact simplicity with
which they set to work to put the few
pieces of the puzzle together, and
to endeavor to read some clew in
them. I returned to my hotel after
this interview more cheered and
sanguine than the incident itself
reasonably warranted.</p>

<p>It was scarcely two years since I
had been in Paris, yet since that
first visit I found it singularly altered.
I could not say exactly how;
but it was not the same. It had
struck me when I first saw it as
the place above all I had yet seen
for a man to build an earthly paradise
to himself; the air was full of
brightness, redolent of light-hearted
pleasure; the aspect of the city, the
looks of the people, suggested at
every point the Epicurean motto,
“Eat, drink, and be merry; for to-morrow
we die!” But it was different
now. Perhaps the change
was in me; in the world within
rather than the world without.
The chord that had formerly answered
to the touch of the vivacious
gayety of the place was broken. I
walked through the streets and
boulevards now with wide-open,
disenchanted eyes, critical and unsympathetic.
Things that had passed
unheeded before appeared to
me with a new meaning. What
struck me as most disagreeable, and
with a sense of complete novelty,
was the widespread popularity
which the devil apparently enjoyed
amongst the Parisians. If, as we
may assume, the popularity of a
name implies the popularity of the
person or the idea that it represents,
it is difficult to exaggerate the
esteem and favor which Satan commands
in the city of bonnets and
revolutions. You can scarcely pass
through any of the thoroughfares
without seeing his name emblazoned
on a shop-window, or his figure
carved or bedaubed in some grotesque
or hideous guise on a sign-board
inviting you to enter and
spend your money under his patronage.
There are devils dancing
and devils grinning, devils fat and
devils lean, a <i lang="fr">diable vert</i> and a <i lang="fr">diable
rose</i>, a <i lang="fr">bon diable</i>, a <i lang="fr">diable à quatre</i>&mdash;every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
conceivable shape and
color of <i lang="fr">diable</i>, in fact, in the range
of the infernal hierarchy. He
stands as high in favor with the
literary guild as with the shop-keepers;
books and plays are called
after him; his name is a household
word in the press; it gives
salt to the editor’s joke and point to
his epigram. The devil is welcome
everywhere, and everywhere set up
as a sign not to be contradicted.
Angels, on the other hand, are at a
discount. Now and then you
chance upon some honorable mention
of the <i lang="fr">ange gardien</i>, but the
rare exception only serves as a
contrast which vindicates the overwhelming
popularity of the fallen
brethren. Is this the outcome of
the promise, “I will give my angels
charge over thee”? And does
Beelzebub’s protection of his Parisian
votaries justify their interpretation
of the message? I was revolving
some such vague conjectures
in my mind as I turned listlessly
into the Rue de Rivoli, and saw a
cab driving in under the <i lang="fr">porte
cochère</i> of my hotel. I quickened
my pace, for I fancied I recognized
a familiar face in the distance.
The glass door at the foot of the
stairs was still swinging, as I pushed
it before me, and heard a voice
calling my name on the first floor.
“Hollo! here you are, uncle!”
I cried, and, clearing the intervening
stair at three bounds, I seized
the admiral by both arms, as he
stood with his hand still on my bell-rope.</p>

<p>“Come in, my boy. Come in,”
he said, and pushed in without turning
his head towards me.</p>

<p>“You have bad news!” I said. I
read it in his averted face and the
subdued gravity of his greeting.
He deliberately took off his hat and
flung his light travelling surtout on
the sofa before he answered me.
Then he came up and laid his hand
on my shoulder. “Yes, very bad
news, my poor fellow; but you will
bear up like a man. It doesn’t all
end here, you know.”</p>

<p>“My God! It is all over, then!
She is dead!” I cried.</p>

<p>He made a gesture that signified
assent, and pressed me down into
a chair. I do not remember what
followed.</p>

<p>I recollect his standing over me,
and whispering words into my ear
that came like the sound of my mother’s
voice&mdash;words that fell like
balm upon my burning brain, and
silenced, as if by some physical force,
other words that were quivering on
my tongue. I never knew or cared
before whether my uncle believed
in anything, whether he had faith
in God or in devils; but as he spoke
to me then I remember feeling a
kind of awe in his presence&mdash;awe
mingled with surprise and a sense
of peace and comfort; it was as if
I had drifted unawares into a haven.
He never left me for a moment till
the hard dumbness was melted, and
I let my head drop on his shoulder,
and wept.…</p>

<p>He told me that the day I left
Dieppe news came of the wreck of
a fishing-smack having floated into
the harbor of St. Valéry. The police
were on the alert, and went at once
to inspect the boat. It had capsized,
and had drifted ashore, after knocking
about on the high seas no one
could say how many days; but it
bore the name of a fisherman who
had been seen in the neighborhood
about ten days before. There was
nothing in the boat, of course, that
could give any indication as to what
had become of its owner or how
the accident had occurred. About
two days later the body of a woman
was washed ashore almost on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
same spot; the police, still on the
<i lang="fr">qui-vive</i>, went down to see it, and at
once telegraphed for my uncle.
The body was lying at the <i lang="fr">morgue</i>
of St. Valéry; it was already decomposing,
but the work of destruction
was not far enough advanced to admit
of doubt as to the identity. The
long, dark hair was dripping with
the slime of the sea, and tangled
like a piece of sea-weed; but the
admiral’s eyes had no sooner glanced
at the face than he recognized it.</p>

<p>I can write this after an interval
of many months, but even now
I cannot recall it without feeling,
almost as vividly as at the moment,
the pang that seemed to cleave my
very life in two. My uncle had
said: “It doesn’t all end here!”
and those words, I believe, preserved
me from suicide. They kept singing,
not in my ears, but within me,
and seemed to be coming out of all
the common sounds that were jarring
and dinning outside. The very
ticking of the clock seemed to repeat
them: “It does not all end
here.” It did, so far as my happiness
went. I was a blighted man
for ever. The dark mystery of the
flight and the death would never be
solved on this side of the grave.
The sea had given up its dead, but
the dead could not speak. I was
alone henceforth with a secret that
no fellow-creature could unriddle
for me. I must bear the burden
of my broken life, without any hope
of alleviation, to the end. The
name of De Winton was safe now.
No blot would come upon it
through the follies or sins of her
who had beamed like a sweet, sudden
star upon my path, and then
gone out, leaving me in the lonely
darkness. Why should I chronicle
my days any more? They can
never be anything to me but a dreary
routine of comings and goings,
without joy or hope to brighten
them. The sun has gone down.
The stone has fallen to the bottom;
the trembling of the circles, as they
quiver upon the surface of the water,
soon passes away, and then all is
still and stagnant again.</p>

<p class="break">So Clide lapses into silence again,
and for a time we lose sight of him.
He is roving about the world, doing
his best to kill pain by excitement,
and soothe memory with hope; and
all this while a new life is getting
ready for him, growing and blossoming,
and patiently waiting for the
summer-time, when the fruit shall
be ripe for him to come and gather
it. The spot which this new life
has chosen for its home is suggestive
rather of the past than of the
future. A tiny brick cottage, with
a thatched roof overgrown with
mosses green and brown, a
quaint remnant of old-fashioned
life, a bit of picturesque long ago
forgotten on the skirts of the red-tiled,
gas-lit, prosperous modern
town of Dullerton. The little brick
box, smothered in its lichens and
mosses, was called The Lilies from a
band of those majestic flowers that
dwelt on either side of the garden-wicket,
like guardian angels of the
place, looking out in serene beauty
on the world without.</p>

<p>It was a nine days’ wonder to
Dullerton when the Comte Raymond
de la Bourbonais and his
daughter Franceline came from
over the seas, and took up their
abode at The Lilies with a French
<i lang="fr">bonne</i> called Angélique. There was
the usual amount of guessing
amongst the gossips as to the why
and the wherefore a foreign nobleman
should have selected such a
place as Dullerton, when, as was
affirmed by those who knew all
about it, he had all the world before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
him to choose from. The only
person who could have thrown
light upon the mystery was Sir
Simon Harness, the lord of the
manor of Dullerton. But Sir Simon
was not considerate enough to do
so; he was even so perverse as to
set the gossips on an entirely wrong
scent for some time; and it was not
until the count and his daughter
had become familiar objects to the
neighborhood that the reason of
their presence there transpired.</p>

<p>The De la Bourbonais were an
old race of royalists whose archives
could have furnished novels for a
generation without mixing one line
of fiction with volumes of fact.
They had fought in every Crusade,
and won spurs on every battle-field
wherever a French prince fought;
they had produced heroes and heroines
in the centuries when such
things were expected from the feudal
lords of France, and they had
furnished scapegraces without end
when these latter became the
fashion; they had quarrelled with
their neighbors, stormed their castles,
and misbehaved themselves
generally like other noble families
of their time, dividing their days
between war and gallantry so evenly
that it was often difficult to say
where the one began and where the
other ended, or which led to which.
This was in the good old times.
Then the Revolution came. The
territorial importance of the De la
Bourbonais was considerably diminished
at this date; but the
prestige of the old name, with the
deeds of prowess that had once
made it a power in the camp and a
glory at the court, was as great as
ever, and marked its owners
amongst the earliest victims of the
Terror. They gave their full contingent
of blue blood to the guillotine,
and what lands remained to
them were confiscated to the Regenerators
of France. The then
head of the house, the father of the
present Comte Raymond, died in
England under the roof of his friend,
Sir Alexander Harness, father of
Sir Simon. The son that was born
to him in exile returned to France
at the Restoration, and grew up in
solitude in the old castle that had
withstood so many storms, and&mdash;thanks
partly to its dilapidated
condition, but chiefly to the fidelity
and courage of an old dependent&mdash;had
been rescued from the general
plunder, and left unmolested for the
young master who came back to
claim it. Comte Raymond lived
there in learned isolation, sharing
the ancestral ruin with a population
of owls, who pursued their
meditations in one wing while he
pondered over philosophical problems
in another. It was a dreary
abode, except for the owls; a desolate
wreck of ancient splendor and
power. We may poetize over ruins,
and clothe them with what pathos
we will, the beauty of decay is but
the beauty of death; the ivy that
flourishes on the grave of a glorious
past is but a harvest of death;
it looks beautiful in the weird silver
shadows of the moon, but it
shrinks before the blaze of day that
lights up the proud castle on the
hill, standing in its strength of battlement
and tower and flying buttress,
and smiling a grim, granite
smile upon the gray wreck in the
valley down below, and wondering
what poets and night-birds can find
in its crumbling arches and gaping
windows to haunt them so fanatically.
Raymond de la Bourbonais
was contented in his weather-beaten
old fortress, and would
probably never have dreamed of
leaving it or changing the owl-like
routine of his life, if it had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
entered into the mind of his grand-aunt,
the only remaining lady of his
name, to marry him. Raymond
started when the subject was broached,
but, with the matter-of-fact coolness
of a Frenchman in such things,
he quickly recovered his composure,
and observed blandly to the
aged countess: “You are right, my
aunt. It had not occurred to me, I
confess; but now that you mention
it, I see it would be desirable.”
And having so far arranged his
marriage, Raymond, satisfied with
his own consent, relapsed into his
books, and begged that he might
hear no more about it until his
grand-aunt had found him a wife.</p>

<p>The family of the De Xaintriacs
lived near him, and happened just
at this moment to have a daughter
to marry; so the old countess ordered
out the lumbering family coach
that had taken her great-grandmother
to the <i lang="fr">fêtes</i> given for Marie
de Medicis on her marriage, and
rumbled over the roads to the
Château de Xaintriac. This ancestral
hall was about on a par with
its neighbor, De la Bourbonais, as
regarded external preservation, but
the similarity between the two
houses ended here. The De Xaintriacs’
origin was lost in the pre-historic
ages before the Deluge, the
earliest record of its existence being
a curious iron casket preserved
in the archives, in which, it was said,
the family papers had been rescued
from the Flood by one of Noe’s
daughters-in-law, “herself a demoiselle
de Xaintriac”&mdash;so ran the
legend. The papers had been destroyed
in a fire many centuries before
the Christian era, but happily the
casket had been saved. It was to
a daughter of this illustrious house
that the Comtesse de la Bourbonais
offered her grand-nephew in marriage.
Armengarde de Xaintriac
was twenty-five years of age, and
shadowed forth in character and
person the finest characteristics of
her mystic genealogy. In addition to
the antediluvian casket, she brought
the husband, who was exactly double
her age, a dower of beauty and
sweetness that surpassed even the
lofty pride that was her birthright.
For four years they were as happy
as two sojourners in this valley of
tears could well be. Then the
young wife began to droop, perishing
away slowly before her husband’s
eyes. “Take her to the
Nile for a year; there is just a
chance that that may save her,”
said the doctors. Armengarde did
not hear the cruel verdict; and
when Raymond came back one
day after a short absence, and
announced that he had come in
unexpectedly to a sum of money,
and proposed their spending the
winter in Egypt, she clapped her
hands, and made ready for the
journey. Raymond watched her
delight like one transfigured, while
she, suspecting nothing, took his
happiness as a certain pledge of
restored health, and went singing
about the house, as if the promise
were already fulfilled. The whole
place revived in a new atmosphere
of hope and security; the low
ceilings, festooned with the cobwebs
of a generation, grew alight with
cheerfulness, and the sunbeams
streamed more freely through the
dingy panes of the deep windows.
It was as if some stray ray from
heaven had crept into the old keep,
lighting it up with a brightness not
of earth.</p>

<p>Angélique was to go with them
in charge of little Franceline, their
only child.</p>

<p>It was on a mild autumn morning,
early in October, that the
travellers set out on their journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
toward the Pyramids. The birds
were singing, though the sun was
hiding behind the clouds; but as
Raymond de la Bourbonais looked
back from the gate to catch a last
glimpse of the home that was no
longer his, the clouds suddenly
parted, and the sun burst out in a
stream of golden light, painting the
old keep with shadows of pathetic
beauty, and investing it with a
charm he had never seen there before.
Sacrifice, like passion, has its
hour of rapture, its crisis of mysterious
pain, when the soul vibrates
between agony and ecstasy. A
sunbeam lighted upon Raymond’s
head, encircling it like a halo.
“My Raymond, you look like an
angel; see, there is a glory round
your head!” cried Armengarde.</p>

<p>“It is because I am so happy!”
replied her husband, with a radiant
smile. “We are going to the land
of the sun, where my pale rose will
grow red again.”</p>

<p>The sacrifice was not quite in vain.
She was spared to him four years;
then she died, and he laid her to
rest under the shade of the great
Pyramid, where they told him that
Abraham and Sara were sleeping.</p>

<p>When M. de la Bourbonais set
foot on his native soil again, he was
a beggar. The money he had received
for the castle and the small
bit of land belonging to it had just
sufficed to keep up the happy delusion
with Armengarde to the last,
and bring him and Franceline and
Angélique home; the three landed
at Marseilles with sufficient money
to keep them for one month, using it
economically. Meantime the count
must look for employment, trusting
to Providence rather than to man.
Providence did not fail him. Help
was at hand in the shape of one of
those kind dispensations that we
call lucky chances, and which are
oftener found in the track of chivalrous
souls than misanthropes like to
own. About three days after his
arrival in the busy mercantile port,
M. de la Bourbonais was walking
along the quay, indulging in sad
reveries with the vacant air and
listless gait now habitual to him,
when a hand was laid brusquely on
his shoulder. “As I live, here is
the man,” cried Sir Simon Harness.
“My dear fellow, you’ve turned up
in the very nick of time; but where
in heaven’s name have you turned
up from?”</p>

<p>The question was soon answered.
Sir Simon gave his heartiest sympathy,
and then told his friend the
meaning of the joyous exclamation
which had greeted him.</p>

<p>“You remember a villain of the
name of Roy&mdash;a notary who played
old Harry with some property
in shares and so forth that your
father entrusted to him just before
he fled to England? You must have
heard him tell the story many a
time, poor fellow. Well, this
worthy, as big a blackguard as ever
cheated the hangman of his fee, was
called up to his reckoning about a
month ago, and, by way, I suppose,
of putting things straight a bit before
he handed in his books, the rascal
put a codicil to his will, restoring
to you what little remained of
the money he swindled your poor
father out of. It is placed in bank
shares&mdash;a mere pittance of the original
amount; but it will keep your
head above water just for the
present, and meantime we must look
about for something for you at headquarters&mdash;some
stick at the court
or a nice little government appointment.
The executors have been
advertising for you in every direction;
it’s the luckiest chance, my
just meeting you in time to give
the good news.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Raymond was thankful for the
timely legacy, but he would not
hear of a stir being made to secure
him either stick or place. He
was too proud to sue at the hands
of the regicide’s son who now sat
on the throne of Louis Seize, nor
would he accept an appointment at
his court, supposing it offered unsolicited.
The pittance that, in Sir
Simon’s opinion, was enough to
keep him above water for a time,
would be, with his simple habits,
enough to float him for the rest of
his life. He had, it is true, visions
of future wealth for Franceline, but
these were to be realized by the
product of his own brain, not by
the pay of a courtly sinecure or
government office. Finding him inexorable
on this point, Sir Simon
ceased to urge it. He was confident
that a life of poverty and obscurity
would soon bring down the
rigid royalist’s pride; but meantime
where was he to live? Raymond
had no idea. Life in a town was
odious to him. He wanted the green
fields and quiet of the country for
his studies; but where was he to
seek them now? He had no mind
to go back to Lorraine and live like
a peasant, in sight of his old home,
that was now in the hands of strangers.
“Come to England,” said Sir
Simon. “You’ll stay with me until
you grow home-sick and want to
leave us. No one will interfere
with you; you can work away at
your books, and be as much of a
hermit as you like.” Raymond accepted
the invitation, but only till
he should find some suitable little
home for himself in the neighborhood.
Within a week he found
himself installed at Dullerton Court
with Franceline and Angélique.
The same rooms that his father had
occupied sixty years before, and
which had ever since been called
the count’s apartments, were prepared
for them. They were very little
changed by the wear and tear of the
intervening half-century. There
were the same costly hangings to the
gilt four-post beds, the same grim,
straight-nosed Queen Elizabeth
staring down from the tapestry, out
of her stiff ruffles, on one wall; the
same faded David and Goliath
wrestling on the other. Raymond
could remember how the pictures
used to fascinate him when he was
a tiny boy, and how he used to lie
awake in his little bed and keep his
eyes fixed on them, and wonder
whether the two would ever leave
off fighting, and if the big man
would not jump up suddenly and
knock down the little man, who was
sticking something into his chest.
Outside the house the scene was
just as unchanged; the lake was in
the same place, and it seemed as if
the swan that was sitting in the
middle of it, with folded sails and
one leg tucked under his wing, was
the identical one that the young
countess used to feed, and that
Raymond cried to be let ride on. The
deer were glancing through the distant
glade, just as he remembered
them as a child, starting at every
sound, and tossing their antlers in
the sunlight; the gray stone of the
grand castellated house may have
been a tinge darker for the smoke
and fog of the sixty additional
years, but this was not noticeable;
the sunbeams sent dashes of golden
light across the flanking towers
with their dark ivy draperies, and
into the deep mullioned windows,
where the queer small panes hid
themselves, as if they were ashamed
to be seen, just as in the old days;
the fountain sent up its crystal
showers on the broad sweep of the
terrace, and the lime and the acacia
trees sheltering the gravel walks that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
led through grassy openings into
the enclosed flower-garden were as
dark and as shady as of yore; the
clumps on the mounds swelling here
and there through the park had not
outgrown the shapes they were in
Raymond’s memory; the lawn was as
smooth and green as when he rolled
over its mossy turf, to the utter
detriment of fresh-frilled pinafores
and white frocks.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant resting-place, a
palm-grove in the wilderness, where
the wayfarer might halt peacefully,
and take breath for the rest of the
journey. Yet Raymond was determined
not to tarry there longer
than was absolutely needful. Sir
Simon did all that a host could do
to make him prolong his stay; but
he was inexorable. He spied out a
tiny brick cottage perched on a bit
of rising ground just below the park,
half-smothered in moss and lichens.
It was beautifully situated as to
view; flowing meadows sloped down
before it towards the river; beyond
the river corn-fields stretched out
towards the woods, that rose like
dark waves breaking at the foot of
the purple hills; the cottage was
called The Lilies, and contained six
rooms, three above and three below,
including the kitchen. When Raymond
offered himself as a tenant for
it, the baronet burst into a ringing
laugh that scared the stately swan
out of his dignity, and sent him
scudding over the water like a
frightened goose. But Raymond
was not to be laughed out of his
purpose; he should have The Lilies,
or he would go away. He must have
it, too, like any ordinary tenant, on
the same conditions, neither better
nor worse. The lease was accordingly
drawn out in due form, and
M. de la Bourbonais entered into
possession after a very short delay.
The room that was intended for a
drawing-room was fitted up with the
count’s books&mdash;the few special treasures
he had rescued from the fate
of all his goods and chattels four
years ago&mdash;and was called the library.
It was not much bigger than a
good-sized book-case, but it would
answer all the purposes of a sitting-room
for the present; Franceline
would never be in his way, and
might sit there as much as she liked.
The landlord had had a little scheme
of his own about the furnishing
of the cottage, and had sent for a
London tradesman to this effect,
intending to surprise Raymond by
having it all ready for him. But
Raymond was as impracticable here
as about the lease. Sir Simon was
annoyed. Raymond contrived to
foil him and have his own way in
everything. He seemed to be half
his time in the moon; but when you
wanted him to stay there, he was suddenly
wide-awake and as wilful as a
mule. There was a substratum of
steel somewhere in him, in spite of
his gentleness; and though it never
hurt you, it repelled you when you
came against it every now and
then, and it was provoking. There
was altogether something about
Raymond that mystified Sir Simon.
To see a man as refined and sensitive
as he was, endowed with the
hereditary instincts that make affluence
a necessity of existence to a
gentleman, settling down into the
conditions and abode of the smallest
of small farmers, and doing it as
cheerfully as if he were perfectly
contented with the prospect, was
something beyond Sir Simon’s comprehension.
To him life without
wealth&mdash;not for its own sake, but
for what it gives and hinders&mdash;was
merely a sentence of penal servitude.
Raymond had always been
poor, he knew; but poverty in the
antique splendor of decayed ancestral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
halls, with the necessaries of
life provided as by a law of nature,
and in the midst of a loyal and reverent
peasantry, was a very different
sort of poverty from what he
was now embarking on. He would
sometimes fix his eyes on Raymond
when he was busying himself, with
apparently great satisfaction, on
some miserable trifle that Angélique
wanted done in her room or in the
kitchen, and wonder whether it was
genuine or feigned, whether sorrow
or philosophy had so deadened him
to external conditions as to make
him indifferent to the material
meanness and miseries of his position.
He never heard a word of
regret, or any expression that could
be construed into regret, escape
him in their most familiar conversations.
Once Raymond, in speaking
of poverty, had confessed that he
had never believed it had any
power to make men unhappy&mdash;such
poverty as his had been&mdash;until he
felt the touch of its cruel finger on
his Armengarde; then he realized
the fact in its full bitterness. But
he had foiled the tormenter by a
sublime fraud of love, and saved his
own heart from an anguish that
would have been more intolerable
than remorse. Sir Simon remembered
the expression of Raymond’s
face as he said this; the smile of
gentle triumph that it wore, as if
gratitude for the rescue and the
sacrifice had alone survived. He
concluded that it was so; that Raymond
had forgiven poverty, since he
had conquered her; and that now
he could take her to live with him
like a snake that had lost its sting,
or some bright-spotted wild beast
that he had wrestled with and tamed,
and might henceforth sport with
in safety.</p>

<p>Sir Simon found it hard to reconcile
this serene philosophical state
of mind with his friend’s insurmountable
reluctance to accept the
least material service, while, on the
other hand, he took with avidity
any amount of affection and sympathy
that was offered to him. It was
because he felt that he could repay
these in kind; whereas for the others
he must remain an insolvent
debtor. “Bourbonais, that is sheer
nonsense and inconsistency. I
wouldn’t give a button for your
philosophy, if it can’t put you above
such weakness. It’s absurd; you
ought to struggle against it and overcome
it.” This was the baronet’s
pet formula; he was always ready
with this advice to his friends. Raymond
never contested the wisdom
of the proposition, or Sir Simon’s
right to enunciate it; but in this particular
at least he did not adopt it.</p>

<p>The gentry of the neighborhood
called in due course at The Lilies,
and M. de la Bourbonais punctiliously
returned the civility, and
here the intercourse ended. He
would accept no hospitality that he
was not in a position to return. He
was on very good terms with his immediate
neighbors, who were none
of them formidable people. There
was Mr. Langrove, the vicar of
Dullerton, and Father Henwick, the
Catholic priest, and Miss Bulpit
and Miss Merrywig, two maiden
ladies, who were in their separate
ways prominent institutions of the
place. These four, with Sir Simon,
were the only persons who could
boast of being on visiting terms
with the shy, polite foreigner who
bowed to every old apple-woman
on the road as if she were a duchess,
and kept the vulgar herd of the
town and the fine people of the
county as much at a distance as if
he were an exiled sovereign who
declined to receive the homage of
other subjects than his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Franceline had been eight years
at Dullerton, and was now in her
seventeenth year. She was very
beautiful, as she stood leaning on the
garden-rail amongst the lilies, looking
like a lily herself, with one dove
perched upon her finger, while another
alighted on her head, and
cooed to it. She was neither a
blonde nor a brunette, as we classify
them, but a type between the two.
Her complexion was of that peculiar
whiteness that we see in fair
northern women, Scandinavians
and Poles; as clear as ivory and
as colorless, the bright vermilion
of the finely cut, sensitive mouth
alone relieving its pallor. Yet her
face was deficient neither in warmth
nor light; the large, almond-shaped
eyes, flashing in shadow, sometimes
black, sometimes purple gray,
lighted it better than the pinkest
roses could have done; and if the
low arch of the dark eyebrows gave
a tinge of severity to it, the impression
was removed by two saucy
dimples that lurked in either cheek,
and were continually breaking out
of their hiding-places, and brightening
the pensive features like a sunbeam.
Franceline’s voice had a
note in it that was as bright as her
dimples. It rang through the brick
cottage like the sound of running
water; and when she laughed, it
was so hearty that you laughed
with her from very sympathy. Such
a creature would have been in her
proper sphere in a palace, treading
on pink marble, and waited on by
a retinue of pages. But she was not
at all out of place at The Lilies;
perhaps, next to the palace and
pink marble, she could not have
alighted in a more appropriate
frame than this mossy flower-bed to
which a capricious destiny had transplanted
her. She seemed quite as
much a fitting part of the place as
the tall, majestic lilies on either
side of the garden-gate. But as regarded
Dullerton beyond the garden-gate,
she was as much out of place
as a gazelle in a herd of Alderney
cows. Dullerton was the very
ideal of commonplace, the embodiment
of respectability and dulness&mdash;wealthy,
fat-of-the-land dulness;
if a prize had been set up
for that native commodity, Dullerton
would certainly have carried
it over every county in England.
There was no reason why it should
have been so dull, for it possessed
quite as many external elements
of sociability as other provincial
neighborhoods, and the climate
was no foggier than elsewhere;
everybody was conscious of the
dulness, and complained of it to
everybody else, but nobody did anything
to mend matters. There was,
nevertheless, a good deal of intercourse
one way or another; a vast
amount of food was interchanged
between the big houses, and the
smaller ones periodically called in
the neighbors to roll croquet-balls
about on the wet grass, and sip tea
under the dripping trees; for it seemed
a law of nature that the weather
was wet on this social occasion. But
nothing daunted the good-will of the
natives; they dressed themselves in
muslins, pink, white, and blue, and
came and played croquet, and
drank tea, and bored themselves,
and went away declaring they had
never been at such a stupid affair
in their lives. The gentlemen were
always in a feeble minority at these
festive gatherings, and, instead of
multiplying themselves to supplement
numbers by zeal, they had a
habit of getting together in a group
to discuss the crops and the game-laws,
leaving their wives and
daughters to seek refuge in county
gossip, match-making, or parish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
affairs, according to their separate
tastes. Dullerton was not a scandal-mongering
place. Its gossip
was mostly of an innocent kind; the
iniquities of servants the difficulties
of getting a tolerable cook or a
housemaid that knew her business,
recipes for economical soups for the
poor, the best place to buy flannels,
etc., formed the staple subjects of
the matrons’ conversation. The
young ladies dressed themselves
bravely in absolute defiance of the
rudiments of art and taste; vied
with each other in disguising their
heads&mdash;some of them very pretty
ones&mdash;under monstrous <i lang="fr">chignons</i>
and outlandish head-gears; practised
the piano, rode on horseback,
and wondered who Mr. Charlton
would eventually marry; whether
his attentions to Miss X&mdash;&mdash; meant
anything, or whether he was only
playing her off against Miss Z&mdash;&mdash;.
Mr. Charlton was the only eligible
young man resident within a radius
of fifteen miles of Dullerton, and
was consequently the target for
many enterprising bows and arrows.
For nine years he had kept mothers
and daughters in harassing suspense
as to “what he meant”;
and, instead of reforming as he grew
older, he was more tantalizing than
ever now at the mature age of
thirty-two. Mothers and maidens
were still on the <i lang="fr">qui-vive</i>, and lived
in perpetual hot water as to the real
intentions of the owner of Moorlands
and six thousand a year.
He had, besides this primary claim
on social consideration, another that
would in itself have made him master
of the situation in Dullerton:
he had a fine voice, and sang a capital
song; and this advantage Mr.
Charlton used somewhat unkindly.
He was as capricious with his voice
as in his attentions, and it was a
serious preoccupation with the dinner-givers
whether he would make
the evening go off delightfully by
singing one of his songs with that
enchanting high C, or leave it to its
native dulness by refusing to sing at
all. The moods and phases of the
tyrannical tenor were, in fact, watched
as eagerly by the expectant hostess
as the antics of the needle
on the eve of a picnic.</p>

<p>The one house of that side of the
county where people did not bore
themselves was Dullerton Court.
They congregated here, predetermined
to enjoy something more than
eating and drinking; and they were
never disappointed. There was
nothing in the entertainments themselves
to explain this fact; the
house was indeed on a grander
scale of architecture, more palatial
than any other country mansion in
those parts; but the people who
met there, and chatted and laughed
and went away in high satisfaction
with themselves and each other,
were the same who congregated
in the other houses to yawn and
be bored, and go away grumbling.
The secret of the difference lay entirely
in the host. Sir Simon Harness
came into the world endowed
with a faculty that predestined him
to rule over a certain class of men&mdash;the
dull and dreary class; people who
have no vital heat of their own, but
are for ever trying to warm themselves
at other people’s fires. He
had, moreover, the genius of hospitality
in all its charms. He
welcomed every commonplace
acquaintance with a heartiness
that put the visitor in instantaneous
good-humor with himself
and his host and all the world.
Society was his life; he could not
live without it. He enjoyed his
fellow-creatures, and he delighted
in having them about him; his
house was open to his friends at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
times and seasons. What else was
a house good for? What pleasure
could a man take in his house, unless
it was full of friends? Unhappily
for Dullerton, Sir Simon was a frequent
absentee. Some said that he
could not stand its dulness for
long at a time, and that this was
why he was continually on the
road to Paris and Vienna and the
sunny shores of Italy and Spain.
But this could not be true; you
had only to witness his mercurial
gayety in the midst of his Dullerton
friends, and hear the ring of his
loud, manly voice when he shook
them by the hand and bade them
welcome, to be convinced that he
enjoyed them to the full as much as
they enjoyed him. It is true that
since M. de la Bourbonais had
come to be his neighbor, the squire
was less of a rover than formerly.
When he was at home, he spent a
great deal of time at The Lilies&mdash;a
circumstance which gave Dullerton
a great deal to talk about, and raised
the reserved, courteous recluse
a great many pegs in the estimation
of the county. The baronet and
his friend had many points of
sympathy besides the primary one
of old hereditary friendship, though
they were as dissimilar in tastes
and character as any two could be.
This dissimilarity was, however,
a part of the mutual attraction.
Sir Simon was an inexhaustible
talker, and M. de la Bourbonais an
indefatigable listener; he had what
Voltaire called a talent for holding
his tongue. But this negative
condition of a good listener was
not his only one; he possessed in
a rare degree all the merits that go
to the composition of that delightful
personage. Most people, while
you are talking to them, are more
occupied in thinking what they will
say to you than in attending to
what you are saying to them, and
these people are miserable listeners.
M. de la Bourbonais gave his whole
mind to what you were saying, and
never thought of his answer until
the time came to give it. He not
only seemed interested, he really
was interested, in your discourse;
and he would frequently hear more
in it than it was meant to convey,
supplying from his own quick intelligence
what was wanting in
your crude, disjointed remarks.
There was nothing in a quiet way
that Sir Simon liked better than an
hour’s talk with his tenant, and he
always came away from the luxury
of having been listened to by a
cultivated, philosophical mind in
high good-humor with himself. His
vanity, moreover, was flattered by
the fact beyond the mere personal
gratification it afforded him. Everybody
knew that the French <i lang="fr">emigré</i>
was a man of learning, given to
abstruse study of some abstract
kind; the convivial squire must
therefore be more learned than he
cared to make believe, since this
philosophical student took such
pleasure in his society. When his
fox-hunting friends would twit him
jocosely on this score, Sir Simon
would pooh-pooh them with a
laugh, observing in a careless way:
“One must dip into this sort of
thing now and then, you see, or
else one’s brain gets rusty. I don’t
care much myself about splitting
hairs on Descartes or untwisting
the fibres of a Greek root, but
it amuses Bourbonais; you see
he has so few to talk to who can
listen to this sort of thing.” It
was true that the conversation did
occasionally take such learned
turns, and equally true that M. de
la Bourbonais enjoyed airing his
views on the schools and dissecting
roots, and that Sir Simon felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
elevated in his own opinion when
the count caught up some hazardous
remark of his on one of the
classic authors, and worked it up
into an elaborate defence of the
said author; and when, on their next
meeting, Raymond would accost
him with “Mon cher, I didn’t
quite see at the moment what you
meant by pointing that line from
Sophocles at me, but I see now,”
Sir Simon would purr inwardly
like a stroked cat. Every now
and then, too, he would startle the
Grand Jury by the brilliancy of
his classical quotations, and the
way in which he bore down on
them with a weight of argument
worthy of a Q.C. in high practice;
little they dreamed that the whole
case had been sifted the day before
by the orator’s learned friend, who
had analyzed it, and put it in shape
for the rhetorical purpose of the
morrow. The baronet was serenely
unconscious of being a plagiarist;
he had got into a way of sucking
his friend’s brains, until he honestly
thought they were his own.</p>

<p>This intellectual piracy is not so
rare, perhaps, as at first sight you
may imagine. It would be a curious
revelation if our own minds
could be laid bare to us, and we
were enabled to see how far their
workings are original and how far
imitative. We should, I fancy, be
startled to find how small a proportion
the former bears to the latter,
and how much that we consider
the spontaneous operation of our
minds is, in reality, but the reflex
of the minds of others, and the unconscious
reproduction of thoughts
and ideas that are suggested by
things outside of us.</p>

<p>Franceline’s <i lang="fr">bonne</i>, as she still
called her, though Angélique had
passed from that single capacity
into the complex position of butler,
cook, housemaid, lady’s maid, and
general factotum at The Lilies, was
as complete a contrast to a name
as ever mortal presented. A gaunt,
high-cheek-boned, grizzly-haired
woman, with a squint and a sharp,
aggressive chin, every inch of her
body protested against the mockery
that had labelled her angelic. She
had a gruff voice like a man’s, and
a trick of tossing her head and
falling back in her chair when she
answered you that had gained her
the nickname of the French grenadier
amongst the rising generation
of Dullerton. Yet the kernel of
this rough husk was as tender and
mellow as a peach, and differed
from the outer woman as much as
the outer woman differed from her
name. When the small boys followed
her round the market, laughing
at her under her very nose, and
accompanying their vernacular comments
with very explicative gestures,
the French grenadier had not the
heart to stop the performance by
sending the actors to the right-about,
as she might have done with
one shake of her soldier-like fist;
but if they had dared to look
crooked at Franceline, or play off
the least of their tricks on M. de la
Bourbonais, she would have punched
their heads for them, and sent
them off yelling with broken noses
without the smallest compunction.
Angélique had found a husband in
her youth, and when he died she
had transferred all her wifely solicitude
to her master and his wife and
child. She could have given him
no greater proof of it than by leaving
her native village and following
him to his foreign home; yet she
never let him suspect that the sacrifice
cost her a pang. She was of
a social turn, and it was no small
trial to be shut out from neighborly
chat by her ignorance of the language.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
She took it out, to be sure,
with the count and Franceline, and
with the few intimates of The Lilies
who spoke French; but, let her improve
these opportunities as she
might, there was still a great gap in
her social life. Conversation with
ladies and gentlemen was one thing,
and a good gossip with a neighbor
was another. But Angélique kept
this grief to herself, and never complained.
With M. le Curé, as she
dubbed Father Henwick, the Catholic
priest of Dullerton, she went the
length of shaking her head, and
observing that people who were
in exile had their purgatory in
this world, and went straight to
heaven when they died. Father
Henwick had been brought up at
S. Sulpice, and spoke French like a
native, and was as good as a born
Frenchman. She could pour her
half-uttered pinings into his ear
without fear or scruple; her dreams
of returning <i lang="fr">dans mon pays</i> at some
future day, when M. le Comte would
have married mademoiselle. She
could even confide to this trusty ear
her anxieties on the latter head, her
fear that M. le Comte, being a philosopher,
would not know how to go
about finding a husband for Franceline.
She could indulge freely in
motherful praises of Franceline’s
perfections, and tell over and over
again the same stories of her nurseling’s
babyhood and childhood;
how certain traits had frightened
her that the <i lang="fr">petite</i> was going to turn
out a very Jezabel for wickedness,
but how she had lived to find out
her mistake. She loved notably to
recall one instance of these juvenile
indications of character; when one
day, after bellowing for a whole hour
without ceasing, the child suddenly
stopped, and Mme. la Comtesse
called out from her pillows under
the palm-tree: “At last! Thank
goodness it’s over!” and how
Franceline stamped her small foot,
and sobbed out: “No-o-o, it’s not
over! I repose myself!” and began
again louder than ever. And
how another day, when a powerful
Arab who was leading her mule
over the hills suddenly lashed his
whip across the shoulders of a little
boy fast asleep on the pathway,
waking him up with a howl of pain,
Franceline clutched her little fist
and struck the savage a box on the
ear, screaming at him in French:
“O you wicked! I wish you were
a thief, and I’d lock you up! I wish
you were a murderer, and I’d cut
your head off! I wish you were a
candle, and I’d blow you out!”
Father Henwick would listen to the
same stories, and delight Angélique
by assuring her for the twentieth
time that they were certain pledges
of future strength and decision in
the woman. And when Angélique
would wind up with the usual remark,
“Ah! our little one is born
for something great; she would
make a famous queen, Monsieur le
Curé,” he would cordially agree with
her, revolving, nevertheless, in his
own mind the theory that there are
many kinds of greatness, and many
queens who go through life without
the coronation ceremony that crowns
them with the outward symbols of
royalty.</p>

<p>Miss Merrywig was another of Angélique’s
friends; but she had not
been educated at S. Sulpice, and so
the intercourse was sustained under
difficulties. Her French was something
terrific. She ignored genders,
despised moods and tenses; and as to
such interlopers as adverbs and prepositions,
Miss Merrywig treated
them with the contempt they deserved.
Her mode of proceeding was extremely
simple: she took a bundle
of infinitives in one hand, and pronouns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and adjectives in another,
and shook them up together, and
they fell into place the best way
they could. It was wonderful how,
somehow or other, they turned into
sentences, and Angélique, by dint
of good-will, always guessed what
Miss Merrywig was driving at. A
great bond between them was their
love of a bargain. Miss Merrywig
delighted in a bargain as only an
old maid with an income of two
hundred pounds a year can delight
in it. She had, moreover, a passion
for making everybody guess what
she paid for things. This harmless
peculiarity was apt to be a nuisance
to her friends. The first thing she
did after investing in a remnant of
some sort, or a second-hand article,
was to carry it the rounds of Dullerton,
and insist on everybody’s guessing
how much it cost.</p>

<p>“Make a guess! You know what
a good linsey costs, and you see
this is pure wool; you can see that?
you have only to feel it. Just feel
it! It’s as soft as cashmere. That’s
what tempted me. I don’t want it
<em>exactly</em>, but then I mightn’t get <em>such</em>
a bargain when I did want it; and,
as the young man at Willis’ said&mdash;they’re
so <em>uncommonly</em> civil at Willis’!&mdash;a
good article <em>always</em> brings
its value; and there was no denying
it <em>was</em> a bargain, and one never
<em>can</em> go wrong in taking a good thing
when one gets it cheap; and they do
mix cotton so much with the wool
nowadays that one can’t be too
particular, as my dear mother used
to say, though in her time it was of
course very different. Now you’ve
examined it, what do you think I
gave for it?” There was no getting
out of it: you might try to fight
off on the plea that you had no experience
in linseys, that you were
no judge&mdash;Miss Merrywig would
take no excuse.</p>

<p>“Well, but give a guess. Say
something. What would you consider
<em>cheap</em>? You know what a
stuff all pure wool <em>ought</em> to be
worth. Just give a guess. Remember,
it was a bargain!” Thus
adjured and driven into a corner,
you timidly ventured a sum, and,
whether you hit it or not, Miss
Merrywig was aggrieved. If you
fell below the mark, there was no
describing her astonishment and
disappointment. “Fifteen shillings!
Dear <em>me</em>! Why, that’s the
price of a common alpaca! Fifteen
shillings! Good <em>gracious</em>! Oh?
you can’t <em>mean</em> it. Do guess again.”</p>

<p>And when, to console her, you
guessed double, and it happened to
be right, she was still inconsolable.</p>

<p>“So you don’t think it was a bargain
after all! Dear me! Well that
<em>is</em> a disappointment. All I can say is
that my dear mother had a linsey that
was not one atom softer or stronger
than this, and she paid just double
for it&mdash;three pounds; she did indeed;
she told me so <em>herself</em>, poor
soul. I often heard her speak highly
of that linsey when I was a child,
and I quite well remember her saying
that it had cost three pounds,
and that it had been well worth the
money.”</p>

<p>You might cry <i lang="la">peccavi</i>, and eat
your words, and declare your conviction
that it was the greatest
windfall you ever heard of; nothing
would pacify Miss Merrywig until
she had carried her bargain to some
one else, and had it guessed at a
higher figure, which you were pretty
sure to be informed of at the
earliest opportunity, and triumphantly
upbraided for your want
of appreciation. Angélique was a
great comfort to Miss Merrywig on
this head. She loved a bargain
dearly, and was proud of showing
that she knew the difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
between one that was and one that
was not; accordingly, she was one
of the first to whom Miss Merrywig
submitted a new purchase. “Voyons!”
the grenadier would say,
and then she would take out her
spectacles, wipe them, adjust them
on her nose, and then deliberately
rub the tissue between her finger
and thumb, look steadily at Miss
Merrywig, as if trying to gather a
hint before committing herself, and
then give an opinion. She generally
premised with the cautious formula:
“Dans mon pays it would be
so-and-so. Of course I can only
make a guess in this country;
prices differ.” She was not often
far astray; but even when she was,
this preface disarmed Miss Merrywig,
and, when Angélique hit the
mark, her satisfaction was unbounded.
Other people might say she
had been cheated, or that she had
paid the full value of the thing.
There was Comte de la Bourbonais’
French maid, who said it was the
<em>greatest</em> bargain she had <em>ever</em> seen;
and being a Frenchwoman, and
accustomed to French stuffs, she
was more likely to know than people
who had never been out of England
in the whole course of their
lives.</p>

<p>The other old maid who occupied
a prominent position at Dullerton,
and was on friendly terms
with the grenadier, was Miss Bulpit.
It would be difficult to meet
with a greater contrast between any
two people than between Miss Bulpit
and Miss Merrywig. The latter
talked in italics, emphasizing all
the small words of her discourse, so
as to throw everything out of joint.
Miss Bulpit spoke “in mournful
numbers,” brought out her sentences
as slowly as a funeral knell, and
was altogether funereal in her aspect.
She was tall and lank, and wore a
black silk wig, pasted in melancholy
braids on either side of her face&mdash;a
perfect foil to the gay little curls
that danced on Miss Merrywig’s
forehead like so many little bells
keeping time to her tongue. Miss
Bulpit was enthroned on a pedestal
of one thousand five hundred
pounds a year, and attended by all
the substantial honors that spring
from such a foundation. She was
fully alive to the advantages of her
position, and had never married
from the fear of being sought more
for her money than for herself. So,
at least, rumor has it. Mr. Tobes,
the Wesleyan clergyman of the
next parish, whose awakening sermons
decoyed the black sheep of
the surrounding folds to him, had
tried for the prize for more than
seven years, but in vain. Miss
Bulpit smiled with benevolent condescension
on his assiduities, allowed
him to meet her at the railway
station and to hand her a bouquet
occasionally; but this was the extent
of his reward. He persevered,
however; and, when Miss Bulpit
shook her black silk head at him
with a melancholy smile and a reproof
for wasting on her the precious
time that belonged to his flock,
Mr. Tobes would reply that the
laborer was worthy of his hire,
and that no man could live without
an occasional recompense for his
labors.</p>

<p>Miss Bulpit was the lowest of the
Low-Church, so zealous in propagating
her own views as to be a severe
trial to the vicar, Mr. Langrove.
The vicar was a shy, scholarly man
and a great lover of peace, but he
was often hard pushed to keep the
peace with Miss Bulpit. She crossed
him in every way, and defied
him to his very face; but it was done
so mildly, with such an unction
of zeal and such a sincere desire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
correct his errors and make up for
his shortcomings, that it was impossible
to treat her like an ordinary
antagonist. She had a soup-kitchen
and a dispensary in her
own house, where the poor of his
parish were fed and healed; and if
Miss Bulpit made these material
things the medium of dealing with
their souls, and if they chose to be
dealt with, how could Mr. Langrove
interfere to prevent it? If she
had a call to break the word to
others, why should she not obey it
just as he obeyed his? He had
his pulpit, which she did not interfere
with&mdash;a mercy for which the
vicar was not, perhaps, sufficiently
grateful. Miss Bulpit was limited
to no restriction of place or time;
she could preach anywhere and at
a moment’s notice; the water was
always at high pressure, and only
wanted a touch to set it flowing into
any channel; the cottages, the
wards of the hospital, the village
school, the roadside, any place was
a rostrum for her. If she met a
group of laborers going home with
their spades over their shoulders,
Miss Bulpit would accost them
with a few good words; and if they
took them well, as their class mostly
do from ladies, she would plunge
into the promiscuous depths of that
awful leather bag of hers that was
Mr. Langrove’s horror, and evolve
from a chaos of pill-boxes, socks,
spectacles, soap, black draughts,
buns, and bobbins, a packet of
tracts, and, selecting an appropriate
one, she would proceed to expound
it, and wind up with a few texts out
of the little black Testament that
lived by itself in an outside pocket
of the black leather bag. This
state of things would have been bad
enough, even if Miss Bulpit had
held sound views; but what made it
infinitely worse was that her orthodoxy
was more than doubtful. But
there was no way of putting her in
her place. She was too rich for
that. If she had been a poor
woman, like Miss Merrywig, it
would have been easy enough; but
Miss Bulpit’s fortune had built a
bulwark of defence round her, and
against these stout walls the vicar’s
shafts might be pointed in perfect
safety to the enemy. It was a great
mercy if they did not recoil on
himself. Some persons accused
him of being ungrateful. How
could he quarrel with her for preaching
in the school when she had re-roofed
it for him, after he had spent
six months in fruitless appeals to
the board to do it? How could the
authorities of the hospital refuse
her the satisfaction of saying a few
serious words to the inmates, when
she supplied them with unlimited
port-wine and jellies, and other
delicacies which the authorities
could not provide? It was very
difficult to turn out a benefactor
who paid liberally for her privileges,
and had so firm a footing in every
charitable institution of the county.
The vicar was not on vantage-ground
in his struggle to hold his
own. Miss Bulpit was a pillar of
the state of Dullerton. There were
not a few who whispered that if
either must go to the wall, it had
better be the parson than the parishioner.
Coals were at famine
prices; soup and port-wine are
comforting to the soul of man, and
the donor’s strictures on S. James
and exclusive enthusiasm for S.
Paul were things that could be tolerated
by those whom they did not
concern.</p>

<p>Franceline had been to see Miss
Merrywig, who lived like a lizard
in the grass, with a willow weeping
copious tears over her mouldy little
cottage. The cheerful old lady always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
spoke with thankfulness of the
quiet and comfort of her home, and
believed that everybody must envy
her its picturesque situation, to say
nothing of the delights of being
wakened by the larks before daylight,
and kept awake long after
midnight by the nightingales.
The woods at Dullerton were alive
with nightingales. On emerging
from the damp darkness after an
hour with Miss Merrywig, Franceline
found that the sun had climbed
up to the zenith, and was pouring
down a sultry glow that made the
earth smoke again. There was a
stile at the end of the wood, and
she sat down to rest herself under
the thick shade of a sycamore. The
stillness of the noon was on everything.
A few lively linnets tried to
sing; but, the effort being prompted
solely by duty, after a while they
gave it up, and withdrew to the
coolest nooks, and enjoyed their
siesta like the lazy ones. Nobody
stirred, except the insects that
were chirping in the grass, and
some bees that sailed from flower
to flower, buzzing and doing field-labor
when everybody else was
asleep or idle. To the right the
fields were brimful of ripening grain
of every shade of gold; the deep-orange
corn was overflowing into
the pale amber of the rye, and the
bearded barley was washing the
hedge that walled it off from the
lemon-colored wheat. To the left
the rich grass-lands were dotted
with flocks and herds. In the
nearest meadow some cattle were
herding. It was too hot to eat, so
they stood surveying the fulness of
the earth with mild, bovine gaze.
They might have been sphinxes, they
were so still; not a muscle
in their sleek bodies moved, except
that a tail lashed out against the
flies now and then. Some were in
the open field, holding up their
white horns to the sunlight; others
were grouped in twos and threes
under a shady tree; but the noontide
hush was on them all. Presently
a number of horses came
trooping leisurely up to the pond
near the stile; the mild-eyed kine
moved their slow heads after the
procession, and then, one by one,
trooped on with it. The noise of
the hoofs plashing into the water,
and the loud lapping of the thirsty
tongues, was like a drink to the hot
silence. Franceline watched them
lifting their wet mouths, all dripping,
from the pool, and felt as if she had
been drinking too. There was a
long, solemn pause, and then a
sound like the blast of an organ
rose up from the pond, swelling and
sweeping over the fields; before it
died away a calf in a distant paddock
answered it.</p>

<p>If any one had told Franceline, as
she sat on her stile, thinking sweet,
nothing-at-all thoughts, under the
sycamore tree, that she was communing
with nature, she would have
opened her dark eyes at them, and
laughed. It was true, nevertheless.
She might not know it, but she drew
a great deal of her happiness from
the woods and fields, and the birds
and the sunsets. Her life had been
from its babyhood, comparatively
speaking, a solitary one, and the
want, or rather the absence, of kindred
companions had driven her
unconsciously into companionship
with nature. Her father’s society
was a melancholy one enough for a
young girl. Raymond’s mind was
like an æolian harp set up in a ruin;
every breath of wind that swept over
it drew out sounds of sweet but
mournful music. Even his cheerfulness&mdash;and
it was uniform and genuine&mdash;had
a note of sadness in it,
like a lively air set in a minor key;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
there was nothing morbid or harsh
in his spirit, but it was entirely out
of tune with youth. He was perfectly
resigned to life, but the spring
was broken; he looked on at Franceline’s
young gayety, as he might
do at the flutterings and soarings
of her doves, with infinite admiration,
but without the faintest response
within himself. So the child
grew up as much alone as a bird
might be with creatures of a different
nature, and made herself a
little world of her own&mdash;not a
dream world, in the sense of ordinary
romance; she had read no novels
and knew nothing about the
great problem of the human heart,
except what its own promptings may
have whispered to her. She made
friends with the flowers and the
birds and the woods, and loved
them as if they were living companions.
She watched their comings
and goings, and found out
their secrets, and got into a way of
talking to them and telling them
hers. As a child, the first peep of
the snowdrop and the first call of
the cuckoo was as exciting an event
to her as the arrival of a new toy
or a new dress to other little girls.
She found S. Francis of Assisi’s
beautiful hymn to his “brother, the
sun, and his sisters, the moon and
the stars,” one day in an old book
of her father’s, and she learned it by
heart, and would warble it in a duet
with the nightingale out of her lattice-window
sometimes when Angélique
fancied her fast asleep. As
she grew up the mystery of the poem
grew clearer to her, and she repeated
it with a deeper sense of sympathy
with the brothers and sisters
that dwell in the sky, and the clear,
pure water, and everywhere in the
beautiful creation. I am sorry if
this sounds unnatural, but I cannot
help it. I am describing Franceline
as I knew her. But I don’t
think it will seem unnatural if you
notice the effect of surroundings
on delicate-fibred children; how
easily they follow the lights we hold
out to them, and how vibratile their
little spirits are. There was no absolute
want of child society at Dullerton,
any more than grown-up society;
but Franceline de la Bourbonais
did not care for it somehow. She felt
shy amongst the noisy, romping
children that swarmed in the nurseries
of Dullerton, and they thought
her a queer child, and did not get
on well with her. The only house
where she cared at all to go in her
juvenile days was the vicarage; but
the attraction was the vicar himself,
rather than his full home, that was
like an aviary of chattering parrots
and chirping canaries. Now that the
parrots were grown up and “going
out,” Franceline saw very little of
them. They were occupied making
markers on perforated card-board
for all their friends, or else “doing
up” their dresses for the next dinner
or croquet party; the staple topic of
their conversation after these entertainments
was why Mr. Charlton
took Miss This down to dinner, instead
of Miss That; whether it was
an accident, or whether there was
anything in it; and how divinely Mr.
Charlton had sung “Ah, non giunge.”
These things were not the least
interesting to Franceline, who was
not “out,” or ever likely to be.
Who would take her, and where
could she get dresses to go? She
hated perforated card-board work,
and she did not know Mr. Charlton.
It was no wonder, therefore, she
felt out of her element at the vicarage,
like a wild bird strayed into a
cackling farmyard, and that the
Langrove girls thought her dull and
cold.</p>

<p>It would be a very superficial observer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
nevertheless, who would accuse
Franceline of either coldness
or dulness, as she sits there on this
lovely summer day, her gypsy hat
thrown back, and showing the small
head in its unbroken outline against
the sky, with the red gold hair drifting
in wavy braids from the broad, ivory
forehead, while her dark eyes glance
over the landscape with an intense
listening expression, as if some inaudible
voices were calling to her.
It was very pleasant sitting there in
the shade doing nothing, and there is
no saying how long she might have
indulged in the delicious <i lang="it">far niente</i>,
if a thrush had not wakened suddenly
in the foliage over her head, and
reminded her that it was time to be
stirring. It was nearly three hours
since she had left home, and Angélique
would be wondering what had
become of her. With a fairy suddenness
of motion she rose up, vaulted
over the stile with the agility of a
young kid, and plunged into the
teeming field. There was a footpath
through it in ordinary times,
but it was flooded now, and she
had to wade through the rye, putting
her arms out before her, as if she
were swimming; for a light breeze
had sprung up and was blowing
the tawny wave in ripples almost
into her face. She shut her eyes
for a moment, and, opening them,
suddenly fancied she was in the
middle of the sea, the sun lighting
up the yellow depths with myriads
of scarlet poppies and blue-bells,
that shone like fairy sea-weed
through the stems. She had not
got quite to the end of the last
field when she heard a sound of
voices coming down the park toward
a small gate that opened into
the fields. She hurried on, thinking
it must be Sir Simon, and perhaps
her father; and it was not until
he was close by the gate that
she discovered her mistake. One
of the voices belonged to Mr.
Charlton, the other to a young man
whom she had never seen before.
Franceline knew Mr. Charlton by
sight. She had met him once at
Miss Merrywig’s, who was a particular
friend of his&mdash;but then everybody
was a particular friend of
Miss Merrywig’s&mdash;and a few times
when she was out walking with Sir
Simon and her father, and the young
man had stood to shake hands;
but this had not led to anything
beyond a bowing acquaintance.
That was not Mr. Charlton’s fault.
There were few things that would
have gratified him more than to be
able to establish himself as a visitor
at The Lilies; but M. de la Bourbonais
had not given him the
smallest sign of encouragement, so
he had to content himself with raising his
hat instinctively an inch higher
than to any other lady of his acquaintance
when he met Franceline
on the road or in the green lanes&mdash;he
on horseback, she, of course, on
foot; and when the young French
girl returned his salute by that
stately little bend of her head, he
would ride on with a sense of
elation, as if a royal princess had
paid him some flattering attention.
This was the first time they had
met alone on foot. Mr. Charlton’s
first impulse was to speak; but
something stronger than first impulse
checked him, and, before he
had made up his mind about it, he
had lost an opportunity. The
stranger, whose presence of mind
was disturbed by no scruples or
timidity, stepped quickly forward,
and lifted the latch of the heavy
wooden gate, and swung it back,
lifting his hat quite off, and remaining
uncovered till Franceline
had passed in. It was very vexatious
to Mr. Charlton to have missed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the chance of the little courtesy,
and to feel that his companion had
the largest share in the bow that included
them both as she walked rapidly
on. Franceline’s curiosity, meanwhile,
was excited. Who could this
strange gentleman be, who looked
so like a Frenchman, and bowed
like one? If he was a guest of Mr.
Charlton’s, she would never know,
most likely; but if he was staying
at the Court, she would soon hear
all about him. She wondered
which way they were going. The
gate had clicked, so they were sure
to have gone on. Franceline
scarcely stopped to consider this,
but, obeying the impulse of the
moment, turned round and looked.
She did so, and saw the stranger,
with his hand still upon the gate,
looking after her.</p>

<h3>THE FUTURE OF THE RUSSIAN CHURCH.</h3>

<p class="center">BY THE REV. CÆSARIUS TONDINI, BARNABITE.</p>

<p class="center">CONCLUDED.</p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>It is time that our notice of this
subject drew towards its close. The
return of the Russian Church to
Catholic unity is the dearest wish
of our heart. A brother in religion
(in which we love each other as
perhaps nowhere else in the world,
because we love each other for eternity)
drew us, during the few
months we spent together in Italy,
to share in his longings and aspirations
for the religious future of Russia,
his native country. Before quitting
Italy Father Schouvaloff went
to Rome, and presented himself before
the Pope. The Holy Father,
Pius IX., engaged him to make a
daily offering of his life to God to
obtain the return of his country to
the unity of the Catholic Church.
Father Schouvaloff joyfully obeyed,
and God, on his part, accepted the
offering. Being sent to Paris towards
the end of the year 1857, Father
Schouvaloff died there on the
2d of April, 1859.</p>

<p>Upon his tomb we promised to
continue, in so far as it would be
granted to us under religious obedience,
our feeble co-operation in
his work; and our writings are in
part the fulfilment of this promise.</p>

<p>Father Schouvaloff’s confidence
in the return of Russia to Catholic
unity was very great; we have fully
shared in this confidence, and everything
that, since his death, has taken
place in Russia, has but served to
augment it. This may appear
strange, but perhaps more than one
among our readers will share it
with us when we have said in what
manner we look forward to this
happy event.</p>

<p>A return of the Russians <i lang="fr">en masse</i>
to Catholic unity we scarcely contemplate.
This could not happen
except under the hypothesis of political
interests which appear to us
inadmissible. And even should we,
in this matter, be mistaken, and
from political interests the Russian
people were to accept union with
Rome, would a union thus brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
about be desirable? Unless we
mistake, the words of Jesus Christ
might be applied to a faith thus
created when he said, <i lang="la">Omnis plantatio
quam non plantavit Pater meus
eradicabitur</i>&mdash;“Every plant which
my Heavenly Father hath not planted
shall be rooted up” (S. Matt. xv.
13). Was it by promising the Jewish
nation to deliver it from the
Roman yoke that Jesus Christ
taught his heavenly doctrine? Was
it by promising independence, honors,
temporal advantages, that
the apostles persuaded the pagans
to believe in the Crucified? Again,
is it by pointing to a perspective
of material advantages that any
Catholic priest, however moderately
cognizant of his own duty and
the good of souls, seeks to induce
any one to become a Catholic? If
to those who aspire to follow Jesus
Christ was always held the same
language as that which he himself
used to them, there might, perhaps,
be fewer conversions, but they
would be true conversions, and each
one would lead on others, as true
as themselves. No; a faith created
by political interests would never
be a real and solid faith, and
other political interests would cause
it to be cast aside as easily as it
had been accepted; it is the tree
which the Father has not planted,
and which will be rooted up. Besides,
history proves it. More than
once have the Greeks momentarily
reunited themselves to the Catholic
Church; their defection has
been explained by the <i lang="la">fides Græca</i>,
and that is all. But let us be just;
Greek faith is pretty much the faith
of every nation. If we take into
account the circumstances under
which these reunions were accomplished,
the motives which led the
Greek bishops, whether to Lyons
or to Florence, and the small care
they took to cause that that which
had agreed happily with their presence
in the council&mdash;the discussion
of the contested points&mdash;should
remain always the principal end,
we shall perceive that the duration
of the reunion would have been a
prodigy.</p>

<p>In not effecting this prodigy our
Lord has perhaps willed to hinder
men from finding in history a denial
given to his words: <i lang="la">Omnis plantatio
quam non plantavit Pater meus
eradicabitur</i>&mdash;“Every plant which
my Heavenly Father hath not planted
shall be rooted up.”</p>

<p>Neither have we by any means
an unlimited confidence in the
action which might be exercised
by the emperors of Russia on the
bishops and clergy of their church.
While retaining the hope that the
czars may understand that it is to
their interest to dispossess themselves,
in great part at least, of the
religious power, and not even despairing
of their favoring the reunion
of the Russian bishops with
Rome, our confidence is not based
upon their actions. It is difficult
for us to believe that they could
be moved by other than political
interests; that which we have said,
therefore, respecting a return <i lang="fr">en
masse</i> of the Russian people, would
consequently here again find its application.
Besides, if formerly the
word of a czar was that of Russia,
and his will the will also of his subjects,
it is no longer the same in
the present day. When Peter I. accepted
the scheme of reunion proposed
by the doctors of the Sorbonne
of Paris, and consented to have it
examined by his bishops (1717);
when Paul I. took into consideration
the plan suggested by Father Gruber
(1800), one might truly have
said, Russia promises fair to become
Catholic. At this present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
time, however, an emperor of Russia
might probably speak and promise
for himself alone. We must
add that at a period when changes
in popular opinion and sympathies
are as frequent as they are sudden,
the simple fact that the reunion
with Rome had been promoted and
favored by a czar might, in certain
circumstances, furnish an additional
pretext for disavowing it afterwards.</p>

<p>But what is it, then, which induces
us to hope, which sustains our confidence,
and which emboldens us
to manifest it openly, though we
should seem to be following an
utopian idea?</p>

<p>In the first place, we have hope
in a change which, grace aiding it,
the events recently accomplished,
and those which are continuing to
take place in Europe, will work on
the minds of men. Events have
their logic, and it imposes itself also
upon the nations. The alternative
indicated above, and which will
force minds to recognize the divinity
of the Catholic Church, will become
an evident fact, and God will
do the rest.</p>

<p>We hope because Alexander II.
has emancipated the peasantry,
and we may be allowed to see in
the emancipation of the peasantry
the prelude to the emancipation of
the Russian Church. We shall return
to this point.</p>

<p>We hope because the spirit of
apostolate, by faith and charity, is
now more powerful than ever in the
Catholic Church. As soon as the
doors of Russia shall be open to
her, and she can there freely exercise
her action, her priests, her missionaries,
her religious orders, her
Sisters of Charity, her Little Sisters
of the Poor, will present themselves
of their own accord. God will do
the rest.</p>

<p>Again, we hope because of the
“Associations of Prayer,” which
have already preceded and powerfully
prepared the way for the return
of Russia to the Catholic
faith. The favor demanded is a
great one, and therefore we have
chosen all that Christian piety, the
church, God himself, offers us as
having most power to prevail with
him. Rather than depend alone on
disseminating leaflets of prayers, or
engaging pious souls to remember
Russia, thus giving to these associations
a form which, in one way
or another, might injure their character
of universality, we have
endeavored to obtain the celebration
of the Holy Sacrifice of the
Mass. For this intention we have
asked for Masses.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> In the Holy
Mass it is Jesus Christ himself who
prays, and he is always heard.</p>

<p>A plenary indulgence, attached to
these Masses, invites the faithful
to unite their prayers with those of
the divine Intercessor. If the faithful
fail, still Jesus pleads; for faith
this is enough.</p>

<p>Lastly, we hope because eighteen
centuries which have passed
away since Jesus Christ quitted the
earth in human form have not been
able to diminish in anything the
creative power of his words. Jesus
Christ promised to faith&mdash;and to
faith possessed in the measure of
a grain of mustard-seed&mdash;that it
should move mountains (S. Matt.
xvii. 19; S. Luke xvii. 6). Thus it
was with happiness, at the last General
Congress at Mechlin, in 1867,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
we made a public act of faith in
proclaiming our unlimited confidence
in prayer, and, we added, “in
prayer presented to God by Mary.”<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
This public act of faith we here repeat.</p>

<p>At the same Congress of Mechlin
we also spoke of our confidence
in the special benediction which
His Holiness Pius IX. had deigned
to grant to us, and which is thus expressed:
<i lang="la">Benedicat te Deus et dirigat
cor et intelligentiam tuam</i>.</p>

<p>This confidence has assuredly
not diminished since that time. Far
from this, if there is one teaching
which imposes itself with an irresistible
force upon our mind, it is
this: that in the Vicar of Jesus Christ,
no less than in Jesus Christ himself,
is fulfilled the declaration of
our divine Saviour, “He that gathereth
not with me, scattereth” (S.
Luke xi. 23).</p>

<p>And further, Jesus Christ spoke
thus to his disciples: <em>When you
shall have done all the things that are
commanded you, say: We are unprofitable
servants: we have done that
which we ought to do</em> (S. Luke xvii.
10). After this it is not even humility,
but simple Christian logic, to
attach a high value to the works
of the apostolate, to the benediction
of the pope; lest we should be not
only unprofitable servants&mdash;which
is always the case&mdash;but dangerous
servants.</p>

<p>It is that, in the first place, the
benediction of the pope, while it
encourages zeal, requires that we
should correct whatever there may
be of human or of reprehensible in
the manner in which our zeal expresses
itself and the means which
it employs. The Vicar of Jesus
Christ cannot and does not bless
anything but what is pleasing to
Jesus Christ and conformable to his
will. That which is not conformable
to these, far from participating
in this benediction, dishonors and
in some sort vilifies it. The benediction
of the pope imposes an obligation.</p>

<p>It is, in the second place, that
the mission of the priest is not to
preach according to his own ideas;
to exercise the ministry according
to his own ideas; to aid the church
according to his own ideas; but to
preach, to exercise the ministry, to
aid the church, after the manner
indicated by God, who is the Master
of the church, who knows her
needs better than we do, and who
has no need of us. And who will
inform us of his will, if not his
legitimate representatives, the bishops,
and, above them, the Vicar
of Jesus Christ, the pope? All
those who, however slightly, have
studied the mysteries of the human
heart, the relations existing between
faith and reason, and the powerlessness
of all human means to produce
one single act of faith, will, we are
certain, partake in the sentiment
which we have just expressed.
Hence it is that we are happy here
to proclaim again our confidence
in the benediction of Pius IX.</p>

<p>Thus, therefore, the logic of
events, the spirit of the apostolate,
the emancipation of the serfs, the
efficaciousness of prayer, the power
of faith, the benediction of Pius IX.&mdash;these
are the things which support
our confidence; these are our
motives for hope.</p>

<p>Are we the plaything of an illusion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and is our confidence the effect
of religious excitement? Not
in any wise; for we are now about
to indicate where lies the principal
obstacle in the way of reunion, and
what is the objection which will
have the most effect upon the minds
of men. It is in the fear that the
popes may overstep the limits of
their authority; that the religious
power may absorb that of the state;
and that Russia would only become
Catholic to the detriment of the national
spirit.</p>

<p>In fact, we cannot deny the teaching
of history, which shows us, almost
always and everywhere, conflicts
between the civil and religious
power. More than in the conduct
of the popes, the true cause of these
will be found, we believe, in the
fact that Cæsarism&mdash;that is to say,
the tendency of sovereigns to obtain
an empire entire and absolute
over their subjects&mdash;is to be found
in human nature itself. To avoid
the possibility of conflicts between
Rome and the various governments,
it would be necessary to change human
nature. Perhaps it may be allowable
to say that, in the difficulty
which stands in the way, practically
to define in an absolute manner the
limits of the two powers, we must
recognize a providential disposition
which has permitted this in order
to open a wider field for the exercise
of virtue. That which was
said by S. Augustine, <i lang="la">Homines
sumus, fragiles, infirmi, lutea vasa
portantes; sed si angustiantur vasa
carnis, dilatentur spatia charitatis</i>,
may find here its application, at
least, if from the supreme representatives
of the two powers, the
pope and the sovereign, we descend
to those who exercise these powers
in their name in less elevated
spheres and in the ordinary details
of life. These smaller and subordinate
authorities, charged to represent
power, and carrying into their
representation of power their personal
character, their private views,
at times their prejudices and their
interests, may be well compared to
those vases of which S. Augustine
speaks&mdash;vases of capacity and of
varied form, and which must be
made to occupy a certain fixed
space. Let only charity intervene,
round the angles, shape the lines,
adapt the prominences to the sinuosities,
determine the length, shorten
where needful, obtain even the
sacrifice of some superfluous ornaments,
these vases will then all find
their place; space is multiplied by
miracle; that which has effected it
is the spirit of Jesus Christ, which
is charity.</p>

<p>This solution of the difficulty by
charity is not, however, the only
one which we propose. Without
speaking of the concordats which
prove that an amicable understanding
may be entered into with Rome,
and also not to mention those
great sovereigns of various countries
whose history proves that to
live in peace with the church is
by no means hurtful to the prosperity
of the state, the Russians
will allow us also to reckon in some
degree upon the intellectual progress
to which, no less than other
nations, they attach a great value.
Now, to advance intellectually is to
perceive that which was previously
hidden from the mind, and to discern
clearly that which was only
half guessed at before. Why, then,
not hope that the Russians will now
see more clearly than in the time
when Peter I. treated them so contemptuously
what must be expected
or feared from the religious and
civil power; that is to say, that if
conflicts appear inevitable, the alternative,
for them as well as for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
other peoples, is this: conflicts with
Rome, or slavery to their sovereigns.
Let them make their choice.</p>

<p>Much is said about the providential
mission of Russia in Asia. Why
not also in Europe? Of all the
nations of Europe, the Russian
people is that which more than all
others knows by experience what
serfdom really is, under the empire
of a sovereign ruling at the same
time bodies and souls. Their submission
has been called “the heroism
of slavery.” “Whoever has
seen Russia,” it has also been said,
“will find himself happy to live
anywhere else.” Well! at the risk
of provoking a smile of incredulity,
we express the hope that there will
be found amongst the Russians
sufficient intelligence to comprehend
that God is offering to them
the most sublime mission with
which he can honor a nation. A
people only now freed from religious
slavery, and consecrating the
first exercise of its liberty to hinder
other nations from falling into the
same slavery, will be worthy of true
admiration, so much would there
be in this conduct of nobleness,
of self-denial, and of disinterestedness!
Now, all this is what Russia
can do. But in order to do it, she
must break with the past; she must
disavow her acts; she must acknowledge
with humility her faults,
which she must hasten to repair.
If those who hold in their hands
the destinies of Russia were not
czars, that would offer no difficulty.
The czars are not the Russian people.
If they have reparation to
make, they have nothing to disavow.
In the situation in which
Russia has been up to the present
time the faults of the czars have
been personally their own; no responsibility
could rest upon the
Russian people.</p>

<p>But Russia is still governed by
the czars. Will they be asked to
break with their past? Will it be
expected that they will disavow
the acts of their dynasty; that they
will acknowledge their faults; that
they will repair them? It is to require
of them a more than heroic
virtue. Are they capable of it?
Why not?</p>

<p>The czar who at this time governs
Russia has emancipated the
Russian peasants, he has abolished
the servitude of the glebe. He has
had to break with his past, disavow
the acts of his ancestors, acknowledge
their faults, and repair
them. He has had to struggle
against immense interior difficulties,
against the interests of the lords,
against routine, against the spirit
of domination, against cupidity.
In spite of all this, Alexander II. is
emancipator of the serfs&mdash;a title far
more glorious than those given by
flattery to Peter I.</p>

<p>When the servitude of the peasantry
was still in existence in Russia,
lords were not wanting who
held to their serfs the following
kind of language: “How happy
you are! You are delivered from all
care for your own existence or for
that of your families! When you
have finished the work which you
owe to me, you can do whatever
you think best. You enjoy in peace
the fruits of the earth, the pleasures
of the country, the free air of the
fields. I consider you as my children.
I take care of you. Your
interests are mine. Your family
joys are mine, and mine also are
your pains. How happy you are!”
In fact, if we are to believe certain
authorities, nothing was wanting to
the happiness of the Russian peasant,
serf of the glebe; it was a perpetual
idyl. In spite of that, all
Europe pitied him. And why?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Because the peasant could not go
whither he would, and because, if
he were not sensible of the privation
of this liberty, it was because
he had been rendered incapable of
appreciating it.</p>

<p>Now, there are peoples who are
chained to the glebe, not by the
body, but by the soul.</p>

<p>They have each their lord, and,
provided that they accomplish the
work which their lord imposes upon
them, they are, for the rest, free to
employ their time as they please.
Care is taken of them, of their
families, of their material interests,
and especially they are unceasingly
reminded that they are free, and
that their lord has nothing more at
heart than their liberty. They are
indeed free to do many things;
but one liberty is wanting to them&mdash;their
body may go whither they
desire it, but their soul is chained
to the glebe. Study being granted
to them, and the knowledge of that
which is passing in the world being
no longer refused to them, they
discover on the earth a church
which calls herself divine, and
charged to conduct all souls to
heaven. They study her; they are
not alarmed at objections; they
know how to make allowance for
human weakness in her children, and
even in her ministers. They find
in this weakness itself one argument
more in favor of the divinity of
this church. They admire the
courage, full of gentleness, of these
bishops. It is truth, it is God,
who speaks by her. These souls desire
God, and they are therefore
drawn towards her, because they
lift themselves up to God. At
this moment a heavy weight holds
them back; wishing to soar towards
heaven, they find themselves chained
to the glebe.</p>

<p>Yes, for the souls who desire
God the false interests of the state
are but a glebe&mdash;a glebe the laws
to which the conscience refuses
to submit&mdash;a glebe the will of the
sovereign, and a glebe also the
traditions of his dynasty.</p>

<p>These people, let others call them
free, and, on the faith of their lords,
let them also call themselves free;
they are none the less people in serfdom&mdash;souls
chained to the glebe.</p>

<p>What glory for Alexander II., if,
after having delivered bodies from
the servitude of the glebe, he would
also deliver souls! What glory,
if, after having delivered his own
subjects from it, he would labor
also to set others free!</p>

<h3>STRAY LEAVES FROM A PASSING LIFE.</h3>

<h4>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">MR. CULPEPPER MAKES A PROPOSAL&mdash;A RENCOUNTER IN A CHURCHYARD.</span></h4>

<p>It was one of those golden November
mornings that throw a mystic
glamour over New York. A
warm haze draped the great city,
softening its deformities, blending
its beauties. In its magic light the
very street-cars took on a romantic
air, as they sped along loaded with
their living freight. The bales of
goods on the sidewalk, huddled together
in careless profusion, were
no longer the danger which they
are generally supposed to be by
elderly gentlemen who have due
regard for life and limb, but gracious
droppings rather from Pandora’s
box, raining down fresh and
bright from the hands of the genial
goddess. What in the garish sun
were vulgar business houses filled
with sober goods and peopled with
staring and sleek-combed clerks, assumed
under this gorgeous drapery
the aspect of mystic temples of
commerce, where silent and solemn-eyed
priests stood patiently
all the day long to call in the passers-by
to worship. The lofty policeman,
looming like a statue at the
corner, was not the ferocious, peanut-chewing
being that he is commonly
supposed to be, but a beneficent
guardian of the great temple
of peace. The busy crowds of
brisk business men that hurried
along, untouched as yet by the toil
and the soil of the day, were fresh-faced
and clear-eyed, chatty and
cheerful. Thompson stepped out
as cheerily as though he were just
beginning that strange task, on
which so many ambitious mortals
have gone down, of performing his
thousand miles in a thousand hours;
for Thompson, happy man! knew
not as yet what was so calmly awaiting
him on his desk&mdash;that heavy bill
that he was bound to meet, but
which, strange to say, had quite
slipped his memory. And there is
Johnson walking arm-in-arm with
Jones, Johnson’s face wreathed in
sunny smiles the while. Johnson’s
heart is gay and his step light, and
he feels the happy influence of the
morning. Jones is sadly in want
of a confidential clerk, and his
friend is dilating on the treasure
that he himself possesses&mdash;that very
clerk who, he learns on reaching
his office, absconded last night with
a fearful amount of Johnson’s property.
Nor, on the other hand, does
that eager-faced youngster, the
shining seams of whose garments
tell of more years than his seamless
face and brow, know that at last the
gracious answer that he has so longed
for awaits his arrival, and that the
bright opening at length lies before
him that is to lead him on to fortune,
if not to fame, more than the five
hundred and forty-six rival applicants
know that their addresses
have been rejected. As yet the
day is marked with neither white
bean nor black, and so let us hope,
with this mighty stream pouring on
and on and on down the great thoroughfares
of the city, that the white
beans may outnumber the black
when the day is done, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
what is lost here may be gained
there; for we are of them, brethren
of theirs, and joyous hopes of this
kind cost little, while, at least, they
harden not the heart. And so the
whole city, with its hopes and fears,
its life and its death, moved out under
the November haze that morning,
and with it, as the central figure
in the vast panorama, he whose
stray leaves, it is hoped, may prove
at least of passing interest to the
many of whom he is one.</p>

<p>My special point of attraction
that day was the office of <cite>The Packet</cite>,
“a monthly journal of polite literature,”
to quote the prospectus,
which was supported by “the ablest
pens of both hemispheres,” as the
same prospectus modestly admitted.
As at this time I was a pretty constant
contributor to <cite>The Packet</cite>, I
suppose that, according to the prospectus,
I was fully entitled to take
my stand among “the ablest pens
of both hemispheres,” whether I
chose to insist on my literary rank
or not. And as I contributed occasionally
to other journals which
were respectively, according to
their several prospectuses, “the
leading weekly,” “the greatest
daily,” “the giant monthly,” “the
only quarterly,” “the great art
journal,” etc., there could not possibly
be any doubt as to my literary
position. For all that, I confess
I was still among the callow brood,
and fear that, if any person had referred
to me in public as “a literary
man,” the literary man would
have blushed very violently, and
felt as small as a titmouse. Still, I had
that delicious feeling of the dawning
of hope and the glorious uncertainty
of a great ambition that always attend
and encourage the first steps
of a new career, whatever be its
character. It was natural enough,
then, that I should step out lustily
among my fellows, my head high
in air, and my heart higher still,
drinking in the inspiration of the
morning, piercing the golden mist
with the eye of hope, feeling a
young life throbbing eagerly within
me, feeling a mysterious brotherhood
with all men, gliding as
through a fairy city in a gilded
dream.</p>

<p>As I had several places to call at,
it was late in the afternoon when
I arrived at <cite>The Packet</cite> office to
draw my little account. On entering
I found an unusual commotion;
something had evidently gone very
wrong. Mr. Culpepper, the experienced
editor of the journal of
polite literature, was, to judge by
the tones of his voice, in a towering
rage. I fancied that I caught
expressions, too, which were not
exactly in accordance with polite
literature. When Mr. Culpepper’s
temper did happen to fail, it was an
event to be remembered, particularly
as that event took place, on an
average, some two or three times a
week. Everything and everybody
in the office was in a turmoil; for
Mr. Culpepper’s temper had an
infectious quality that affected all
its immediate surroundings. An
experienced eye could tell by the
position of the dictionary, the state
of the floor, the standing of the
waste-basket, the precise turn of
the editor’s easy-chair, how the
wind blew to Mr. Culpepper. On
this mild November afternoon it
was clear that a terrific gale had
sprung up from some unexpected
quarter. It had ruffled what was
left of Mr. Culpepper’s hair, it blew
his cravat awry, it had disarranged
his highly intellectual whiskers, it
spared not even his venerable coat-tails.
His private office showed
the effects of a raging tornado.
Pigeon-holes had been ransacked;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
drawers had been wrenched open
and rifled of their contents; Webster
and Worcester lay cheek-by-jowl
in the waste-basket; the easy-chair
had a dangerous crick in the
back; Mr. Culpepper himself was
plunged ankle-deep in manuscripts
that strewed the floor in wild confusion;
while Mr. Culpepper’s hands
were thrust in his cavernous pockets,
as he stood there on my entrance,
a very monument of editorial despair.</p>

<p>Mr. Culpepper, like most men,
was preferable when good-tempered.
Indeed, though his opinions
at times, particularly on the merits
or demerits of my own compositions,
were apt to be more emphatic
than polished, Mr. Culpepper,
when good-tempered, was by no
means an unpleasant companion.
In his stormy periods I always
coasted as clear of him as I could;
but it was now too late to sheer off.
So, making the best of a bad bargain,
I advanced boldly to meet the
enemy, when to my surprise he greeted
me with the exclamation,</p>

<p>“Oh! you are just the man I wanted.
Can you tell a story&mdash;a good,
lively Christmas story, with a spice
of fun, a dash of love, a slice of
plum-pudding, a sprinkling of holly
and ivy, with a bunch of mistletoe
thrown in? And, by the bye, if
you have genius enough, a good
ghost. Yes, a good, old-fashioned
ghost would be capital. They are
dying out now, more’s the pity. Yes,
I must have a ghost and a country
churchyard, with a bowl of punch,
if you want it. There are your
materials. Now, I want them fixed
up into a first-class Christmas story,
to fill exactly eight pages, by four
o’clock to-morrow afternoon at the
latest. Must have it to fit this
illustration. Clepston was to have
done it, but he has failed me at the
last hour. Just like him&mdash;he must
go and get married just when I
want my story. He did it on purpose,
because I refused to advance
his pay&mdash;married out of revenge,
just to spite me. Well, what do
you say?”</p>

<p>I said nothing; for Mr. Culpepper’s
rapidity and the novelty of
his proposal fairly took my breath
away. I had never yet attempted
fiction, but there was a certain raciness
in Mr. Culpepper’s manner of
putting it that urged me to seize
my present opportunity. A good
ghost-story within just twenty-four
hours! A pleasant winter tale that
should be read to happy families by
happy firesides; by boys at school,
their hair standing on end with
wild excitement, and their laughter
ringing out as only boys’ laughter
does; by sweet-faced girls&mdash;by
everybody, in fact, with a vast
amount of pleasure and not a twinge
of pain. Thousands whom I should
never know would say, “What a
dear fellow this story-teller is!”
“What a pleasant way he has of
putting things!” “What&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you say?” broke
in Mr. Culpepper rudely; and I
remembered that the story which
was to win me such golden opinions
from all sorts of people was yet to
be written.</p>

<p>“I hardly know. Four o’clock
to-morrow afternoon? The time
is so very short. Could you not extend
it?”</p>

<p>“Not a moment. Printers waiting
now. If I can’t have yours by
that time, I must use something
else; and I have not a thing to
suit. Just look here,” he said
pointing to the floor, and glancing
ruefully around; “I have spent the
day wading through all these things,
and there is nothing among the
pile. A mass of rubbish, all of it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>My resolution was made; I started
up.</p>

<p>“Mr. Culpepper, I will try. I
will stay up all night; and if there
be a ghost yet unlaid, a pudding
yet unmade, a piece of holly yet ungathered,
or a bunch of mistletoe
that has not yet done duty, you
shall have them all by four o’clock
to-morrow afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Now, I rely on you, mind. Four
o’clock sharp. Let it be brisk and
frosty, bright as the holly-berries,
and soothing as a glass of punch!
We owe you a little account, I believe.
Here it is, and now good-by
till to-morrow afternoon.”</p>

<p>Who has not experienced that
half-fearful and yet wholly pleasant
feeling of setting foot for the
first time in a new and strange
land? It was with some such feeling
that my heart fluttered as I left
the office of <cite>The Packet</cite> that afternoon.
Yet what was I to achieve
within the next four-and-twenty
hours? An eight-page Christmas
story of the approved pattern, with
the conventional sauces and seasonings&mdash;nothing
more. The thing had
been done a thousand times before,
and would be done a thousand times
again, as often as Christmases came
round, and thought nothing of.
Why should I be so fluttered at the
task? Was this to be the great
beginning at last of my new career?
Was this trumpery eight-page story
to be the true keynote to what was
to make music of all the rest of my
life? Nonsense! I said to myself;
and yet why nonsense? Did not
all great enterprises spring from
small and insignificant beginnings?
Were not all great men at some time
or another babies in arms, rocked
in cradles, fed on soothing syrups,
and carried about in long clothes?
Did not a falling apple lead Newton
on to the great discovery of
gravitation? Was it not a simmering
kettle that opened Watt’s eyes
to steam, and introduced the railway
and the packet? Did not a
handful of sand reveal the mines
of California? Must not Euclid
have started with a right reading
of axioms as old as the world?
Who shall fix the starting-point of
genius? And why should not my
first fictitious Christmas pudding
contain the germ of wonders that
were to be?</p>

<p>I can feel the astute and experienced
reader who has been gracious
enough to accompany me thus far
already falter at the very outset of
the short excursion we purposed
taking together. I can feel the
pages close over me like a tomb,
while a weary yawn sings my
death-dirge. But allow me, my
dear sir, or my dear madam, or my
much-esteemed young lady, to stay
your hands just one moment, until
I explain matters a little, until I introduce
myself properly; and I
promise to be very candid in all I
have to say. You see&mdash;indeed, you
will have seen already&mdash;that the gentleman
who has just left Mr. Culpepper’s
presence was at this period
of his life very young indeed, and
proportionately ambitious. These
two facts will explain the fluttering
of his heart at the cold-blooded
proposal of spending an entire night
at his writing-desk, delving his brain
for the materials of a silly little
story, while you, dear sir, have
drawn over your ears, and over that
head that has been rubbed into
reverent smoothness by the gentle
hand of time, the sleep-compelling
night-cap; and while you, dear
madam, while you have&mdash;done nothing
of the kind. I plead guilty,
then, at this time, to the twofold
and terrible charge of outrageous
youth and still more outrageous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
ambition. But I have long since
contrived to overcome the disgrace
of excessive youth; while, as regards
ambition, what once happened
to a literary friend of mine has
never happened to me: that morning
I have been waiting for so
long, so long, when I was to wake
up and find myself famous, has not
yet arrived&mdash;looks even as though
it never meant to dawn. Literature
was to me an unknown sea, upon
which I had not fairly embarked.
I had paddled a little in a little
cockleshell of my own in sunny
weather around friendly coasts,
but as yet had not ventured to
launch out into the great deep.
The storm and the darkness and
the night, the glory and the dread
of the tempest, the awful conflicts
of the elements, were as yet unknown
to and unbraved by me.
Indeed, as I promised to be candid,
I may as well whisper in your ear
that the main efforts of my pen at
this precise period of my life were
devoted to meeting with a calm
front and easy conscience the weekly
eye of Mrs. Jinks. Mrs. Jinks
was my boarding-house keeper, a
remarkable woman in her way, and
one for whom I entertained an
unbounded respect; but she was
scarcely a Mme. de Staël, unless in
looks, still less a Mme. de Sévigné.
Mme. Jinks’ encouragement to aspiring
genius was singularly small
when aspiring genius could not pay
its weekly board&mdash;a contingency
that has been known to occur.
Mrs. Jinks never fell into the fatal
mistake of tempting the man to eat
unless the man was prepared to pay.
But even Mrs. Jinks could not
crush out all ambition, so that I
hugged Mr. Culpepper’s proposal,
as I went home that evening, with
a fervor and enthusiasm that I had
never before experienced; for it
seemed to open up to me a new
vista of bright and beautiful imaginings.</p>

<p>For all that, I could not strike the
clew. It seems a very easy thing,
does it not, to concoct a passable
enough Christmas story out of the
ample materials with which Mr.
Culpepper had so lavishly supplied
me? Just try; sit down and write a
good, short, brisk Christmas story,
out of all the time-honored materials,
and judge for yourself what an
easy task it is, O sapient critic!
a line from whose practised pen
stabs to death a year of hopes, and
projects, and labor. Strange to
say, my immediate project dissolved
and faded out of my mind, as I
plodded homewards along the great
thoroughfare I had trodden so serenely
in the morning. The little
Christmas story gave place to something
new, something larger, something
vague, indefinable, and mighty.
A great realm of fiction unfolded
itself before me&mdash;a realm all
my own, a fairy island in a summer
sea, peopled with Calibans and
dainty Ariels, Mirandas and Ferdinands,
and a thousand unseen creatures,
waiting only for the wave of
my magic wand to be summoned
into the beauty of life, to bring
sweet songs down from the clouds
of heaven, and whisperings of
spirits far away that the earth had
never yet heard. A mist sprang up
around me as I walked, and through
it peered a thousand eyes, and from
it came and went a thousand shapeless
forms, whose outlines I could
half discern, but hold not. I could
not bid them stay until I grasped
them. Something was wanting, a
touch only, a magic word, but I
could not find it. A charm was on
me, and more potent than I. It
was there, working, working, working,
but I could not master it. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
walked along in a dream. Men in
throngs passed me by in what
seemed a strange and awful silence.
If they spoke, never a word heard
I. Carriages and vehicles of every
description I felt rolling, rolling
past; but their wheels were strangely
muffled, for never a sound fell on
my ear. The fair, bright city of the
morning was filled now with silent
shadows, moving like ghosts in a
troubled dream. Lights sprang up
out of the mist as I passed along,
but they seemed to shine upon me
alone. Intensely conscious of my
own existence, I had only a numb
feeling of other life around me.
At last I found myself at Mrs.
Jinks’ door. I took a letter from
her hand, and seated at length in
my own room, with familiar objects
around me, the shadows seemed to
lift, and I was brought back to the
subject of my proposed night’s
work.</p>

<p>Still, I could not collect my
thoughts sufficiently to bring them
to bear, in a practical way, on the
central idea around which my fiction
was to take body and shape.
The sudden strain on my imagination
had been too severe; a kind of
numbness pervaded my whole being,
and the moments, every one of
which was precious as a grain of
gold, were slipping idly away. The
feeling that all the power to achieve
what you desire lies there torpid
within you, but too sullen to be
either coaxed or bullied into action,
laughing sluggishly at the most
violent effort of the will to move it,
is, perhaps, one of the most exasperating
that a man can experience.
It is like one in a nightmare, who
sees impending over him a nameless
terror that it only needs a wag
of a little tongue to divert, and yet
the little tongue cleaves with such
monstrous persistency to the roof
of the parched mouth that not all
the leverage of Archimedes himself
could move it from its place.
That fine power of man’s intellect,
that clear perception and keen precision
which can search the memory,
and at a glance find the clew
that it is seeking; that can throw
out those far-reaching fibres over
the garden of knowledge, gathering
in from all sides the necessary
stores, was as far away from me as
from a madman’s dream. I could
fasten upon nothing; my brain was
in disorder, while the moments were
lengthening into hours, and the
hours slipping silently away.</p>

<p>In despair I tried a cigar&mdash;a favorite
refuge of mine in difficulties; and
soon light clouds, pervaded with a
subtle aroma, were added to those
thinner clouds of undefined and indefinable
images that floated around
me, volatile, shadowy, intangible;
mysterious, nebulous. Mr. Culpepper’s
“materials” had quite evaporated,
and I began to think dreamily
of old days, of anything, everything,
save what was to the point. I remember
how poor old Wetherhead,
of all people in the world&mdash;“Leatherhead”
we used facetiously to style
him at college&mdash;came up before me,
and I laughed over the fun we had
with him. What a plodder he was!
When preparing for his degree, he
took ferociously to wet towels. He
had the firmest faith in wet towels.
He had tried them for the matriculation,
and found them “capital,”
he assured us. “Try a towel, Leathers,”
we would say to him whenever
we saw him in difficulties. Poor
fellow! He was naturally dull and
heavy, dense and persistent as a
clod. It would take digging and
hoeing and trenching to plant anything
in that too solid brain; and
yet he was the most hopeful fellow
alive. He was possessed with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
very passion of study, without a
streak of brightness or imagination
to soften and loosen the hopeless
mass of clay whereof his mind seemed
composed; and so he depended
on wet towels to moisten it. He
almost wore his head out while preparing
for the matriculation examen.
But by slow and constant effort
he succeeded in forcing a
sufficient quantity of knowledge into
his pores, and retaining it there, to
enable him to pass the very best-deserved
first class that ever was won.
The passage of the Alps to a Hannibal
or a Napoleon was a puny feat compared with
the passing of an examination
by a Wetherhead. We took him
on our shoulders, and bore him aloft
in triumph, a banner-bearer, with a
towel for banner, marching at the
head of the procession. “You may
laugh, but it was the towels pulled
me through, old fellow,” he said to
me, smiling, his great face expanding
with delight. “Stay there, and
don’t go any farther, Leathers,” I
advised, when he proclaimed his
intention of going up for the degrees.
“Nonsense!” said he, and, in
spite of everybody’s warnings, Wetherhead
“went in” for the B.A.
It was a sight to see him in the
agonies of study; his eyes almost
starting out of his head as the day
wore on, and around that head,
arranged in turban fashion, an enormous
towel reeking with moisture.
“How many towels to-day, Leathers?”
“How’s the reservoir, Leatherhead?”
those impudent youngsters
would cry out. As time went
on and the examination drew near
the whole college became interested
in Wetherhead and his prospects
of success. Bets were made on
him, and bets were made on his
towels. The wit of our class wrote
an essay&mdash;which, it was whispered
aloud, had reached the professors’
room, and been read aloud there to
their intense amusement&mdash;on “Towels
<i>vs.</i> Degrees; or, The probabilities
of success, measured by the
quantity of water on the brain.”
He bore it all good-humoredly,
even the threat to crown him with
towels instead of laurel if he passed
and went up for his degree. A
dark whisper reached me, away in
the country at the time, that he had
failed, that the failure had touched
his brain, and that he was cut down
half-strangled one morning from his
own door-key, to which he had suspended
himself by means of a wet
towel; which, instead of its usual
position around his brow, had fastened
itself around his throat. Of
course that was a malicious libel;
for I met the poor fellow soon after,
looking the ghost of himself. “How
was it, Wetherhead?” I asked. “I
don’t know, old fellow,” he responded
mournfully. “I got through
splendidly the first few days; but
after that things began to get muddled
and mixed up somehow, so
that I could hardly tell one from
another. It was all there, but
something had got out of order. I
felt that it was all there, but there
was too much to hold together.
The fact is, <em>I missed my towel</em>. A
towel or two would have set it all
right again. The machine had got
too hot, and wanted a little cooling
off; but I couldn’t march in
there, you know, with a big towel
round my head; so I failed.”</p>

<p>The clock striking twelve woke
me from my dream of school-days. I
had just sixteen hours and a half
left to complete the story that was
not yet begun. Whew! I might as
well engage to write a history of
science within the appointed time.
It was useless. My cigar had gone
out, and I gave up the idea of writing
a story at all. And yet surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
it was so easy, and I had promised
Culpepper, and both he and <cite>The
Packet</cite> and the public were awaiting
my decision. And this was to be
the end of what I had deemed
the dawn of my hope and the
firstling of my true genius!</p>

<p>“Roger Herbert, you are an ass,”
spake a voice I knew well&mdash;a voice
that compelled my attention at the
most unseasonable hours. “Excuse
me for my plainness of speech, but
you are emphatically an ass. Now,
now, no bluster, no anger. If you and
I cannot honestly avow the plain
truth to each other, there is no hope
for manhood. Mr. Culpepper and
the public waiting for you! Ho! ho!
Ha! ha! It’s a capital joke. Mr.
Culpepper is at this moment in the
peaceful enjoyment of his first slumbers;
and the public would not
even know your name if it were told
them. Upon my word, Roger, you
are even a greater ass than I took
you to be. Well, well, we live and
learn. For the last half-a-dozen
hours or more where have you
been? Floating in the clouds; full
of the elixir of life; dreaming great
dreams, your spirit within you fanned
with the movement of the <i lang="la">divinus
afflatus</i>, eh? Is not that it? Nonsense,
my dear lad. You have only
once again mounted those two-foot
stilts, against which I am always
warning you, and which any little
mountebank can manage better
than you. <em>They</em> may show some
skill, but you only tumble. So
come down at once, my fine fellow,
and tread on <i lang="la">terra firma</i> again,
where alone you are safe. You a genius!
Ho! ho! Ho! ho! ho! And
all apropos of a Christmas pudding.
The genius of a Christmas pudding!
It is too good. Your proper business,
when Mr. Culpepper made his
proposal to you this afternoon, was
to tell him honestly that the task he
set you was one quite beyond your
strength&mdash;altogether out of your
reach, in fact. But no; you must
mount your stilts, and, once on
them, of course you are a head and
shoulders above honest folk. O
Roger, Roger! why not remember
your true stature? What is the use
of a man of five foot four trying to
palm himself off and give himself
the airs of one of six foot four?
He is only laughed at for his pains,
as Mr. Culpepper will assuredly
laugh at you to-morrow. Take my
advice, dear boy, acknowledge your
fault, and then go to bed. You are
no genius, Roger. In what, pray,
are you better, in what are you so
good, as fifty of your acquaintances,
whom I could name right off for
you, but who never dream that they
are geniuses? The <i lang="la">divinus afflatus</i>,
forsooth! For shame, for shame,
little man! Stick to your last, my
friend, and be thankful even that
you have a last whereto to stick. Let
Apelles alone, or let the other little
cobblers carp at him, if they will.
The world will think more of his
blunders than of all your handicraft
put together, and your little
cobbler criticisms into the bargain.
And now, having said my say, I wish
you a very good-night, Roger, or
good-morning rather.”</p>

<p>So spake the voice of the <em>Daimon</em>
within me; a very bitter voice it has
often proved to me&mdash;as bitter, but as
healthy, as a tonic. And at its
whisper down tumbled all “the
cloud-capt towers and gorgeous
palaces” that my imagination had
so swiftly conjured up. It was
somewhat humiliating to confess,
but, after all, Roger Herbert, Senior,
as I called that inner voice, was
right. I resolved to go to bed.
Full of that practical purpose, I
went to my desk to close it up for
the night, and all dreams of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
momentary ambition with it, when
my eyes fell upon a letter bearing
the address:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">Roger Herbert, Esq.</span>,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Care of Mrs. Jinks,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">&mdash;&mdash; Street,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">New York,</div>
<div class="verse indent4">United States,</div>
<div class="verse indent5">America.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>What a quantity of writing for so
small an envelope! One needed
no curious peep within, nor scarcely
a second glance at the neat-pointed
hand, with the up-and-down
strokes of equal thickness, to guess
at the sex of the writer. I remembered
now; it was the letter Mrs.
Jinks gave me at the door, and,
good heavens! it had been lying
there disregarded all these hours,
while I was inflated with my absurd
and bombastic thoughts. The
writing I knew well, for my hand
had been the first to guide the writer
through the mazes and the mysteries
of chirography. One sentence
from the letter is sufficient to
give here. “Dear, dear Roger:
Papa is sick&mdash;is <em>dying</em>. Come home
at once.” It was signed “Fairy.”</p>

<p>“Home at once!” The post-marks
said London and Leighstone.
London, it may be necessary to
inform the reader, is the capital
of a county called Middlesex, in
a country called England, while
Leighstone is a small country town
some thirty miles out of London.
From Leighstone writes “Fairy”
to “Dear, dear Roger” some thousand&mdash;it
seems fifty thousand&mdash;odd
miles away. The father reported
dying is my father; Fairy is
my sister. It is now nearly two in
the morning, and by four in the
afternoon Mr. Culpepper and the
printers expect that brisk, pleasant,
old-fashioned Christmas story that
is to make everybody happy, and
not a hint at pain in it! And I
have been puzzling my brains these
long hours past trying to compose
it, with that silent letter staring me
in the face all the time. A pleasant
Christmas story, a cheery
Christmas story! How bitterly
that voice began to laugh within
me again! Oh! the folly, the crime,
of which I had been guilty. It was
such vain and idle dreams as these
that had lured me away from that
father’s side; that had brought me
almost to forget him; that, great
God! perhaps had dealt the blow
that struck him down. Merciful
heavens! what a Christmas story
will it be mine to tell?</p>

<p>At four in the afternoon a steamer
sailed for Liverpool, and I was
one of the passengers. Years have
passed since then, and I can write
all this calmly enough now; but
only those&mdash;and God grant that they
may be few!&mdash;who at a moment’s
warning, or at any warning, have
had to cross more than a thousand
miles of ocean in the hope of catching
a dying parent’s last breath, can
tell how the days pall and the sleepless
nights drag on; how the sky
expands into a mighty shroud
covering one dear object, of which
the sad eyes never lose the sight;
how the winds, roar they loud or
sing they softly, breathe ever the
same low, monotonous dirge.</p>

<p>It was scarcely a year since I had
parted from my father, and our
parting had not been of the friendliest.
He was a magnate in Leighstone,
as all the Herberts before
him had been since Leighstone had
a history. They were a tradition
in the place; and though to be
great there in these days did not
mean what it once meant, and to
the world outside signified very
little indeed, yet what is so exacting
or punctilious as the etiquette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of a petty court, what so precise
and well preserved as its narrow
traditions and customs? Time did
not exist for Leighstone when a
Herbert was not the foremost man
there. The tomb of the Herberts
was the oldest and grandest in the
churchyard that held the ashes of
whole generations of the Leighstone
folk. There had been Crusading
Herberts, and Bishops Herbert,
Catholic and Protestant, Abbots
Herbert, Justices Herbert, Herberts
that had shared in councils of state,
and Herberts that had been hanged,
drawn, and quartered by order of
the state. Old townsfolk would
bring visitors to the churchyard
and give in their own way the history
of “that ere Harbert astretched
out atop o’ the twomb, wi’ a
swoord by his soide, and gluvs on
his hands, the two on ’em folded
one aginst t’other a-prayin’ loike,
and a cross on his buzzum, and a
coople o’ angels wi’ stone wings
a-watchin’ each side o’ ’im. A had
fowt in the waars long ago, that ere
Harbert had, when gentle-folk used
to wear steel coats, a used, and
iron breeches, and go ever so fur
over the seas to foight. Queer
toimes them was. Whoi, the Harberts,
folks did say, was the oldest
fam’ly i’ the country. Leastwoise,
there was few ’uns older.”</p>

<p>My father was possessed with the
greatness of his ancestry, and resented
the new-fangled notions that
professed to see nothing in blood
or history. Nurtured on tradition
of a past that would never reappear,
he speedily retired from a
world where he was too eager to
see that a Herbert was no more
than a Jones or a Smith, and, though
gifted with powers that, rightly
used, might have proved, even in
these days, that there was more in
his race than tradition of a faded
past, he preferred withdrawing into
that past to reproducing it in a
manner accommodated to the new
order of things. In all other respects
he was a very amiable English
gentleman, who, abjuring politics,
which he held had degenerated
into a trade unbecoming a gentleman’s
following, divided his time
between antiquarian and agricultural
pursuits, for neither of which
did I exhibit so ardent an admiration
as he had hoped. As soon as
I could read, and think, and reason
in my own way, I ran counter
to my father in many things, and
was pronounced by him to be a
radical, infected with the dangerous
doctrines of the day, which
threatened the overthrow of all
things good, and the advent of all
things evil. He only read in history
the records of a few great families.
For me the families were of
far less interest than the peoples,
historically at least. The families
had already passed or were passing
away; the peoples always remained.
To the families I attributed most
of the evils that had afflicted humanity;
in the peoples I found
the stuff that from time to time
helped to regenerate humanity. I
do not say that all this came to me
at once; but this manner of looking
at things grew upon me, and made
my father anxious about my future,
though he was too kind to place
any great restrictions in the way
of my pursuits, and our disputes
would generally end by the injunction:
“Roger, whatever you do or
think, always remember that you
represent a noble race, and are by
your very birth an English gentleman,
so long as such a being is permitted
to exist.”</p>

<p>As I grew older problems thickened
around me, and I often envied
the passive resignation with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
so spirited a temperament as my
father’s could find refuge from the
exciting questions of the day in the
quiet of his books and favorite
pursuits. Coming home from
college or from an occasional excursion
into the great world without,
Leighstone would seem to me
a hermitage, where life was extinct,
and there was room for nothing
save meditation. And there I meditated
much, and pondered and
read, as I then thought, deeply.
The quaint, old churchyard was
my favorite ground for colloquy
with myself, and admirably adapted,
with its generations of silent
dead, was it for the purpose.
In that very tomb lay bones, once
clothed with flesh, through which
coursed lustily blood that had
filtered down through the ages into
my veins. In my thoughts I would
question that quiet old Herbert
stretched out there on his tomb
centuries ago, and lying so still,
with his calm, stony face upturned
immovably and confidently to heaven.
The face was not unlike my
father’s; Leighstone folk said it
was still more like mine. That
Herbert was a Catholic, and believed
earnestly in all that I and
my father as earnestly disbelieved.
Was he the worse or the better
man for his faith? To what had
his faith led him, and to what had
ours led us? What was his faith,
and what was ours? To us he was
a superstitious creature, born in
dark ages, and the victim of a cunning
priestcraft, that, in the name
of heaven, darkened the minds and
hearts of men; while, had he
dreamed that a degenerate child of
his would ever, even in after-ages,
turn heretic, as he would say, the
probabilities were that in his great-hearted
earnestness, had it rested
solely with him, he would rather
have ended the line in his own person
than that such disgrace should
ever come upon it. The man who
in his day had dared tell him
that flesh of his would ever revile
the church in which he believed,
and the Sacrament which he adored,
would likely enough have been
piously knocked on the head for
his pains. What a puzzle it all
was! Could a century or two
make all this difference in the manner
of regarding the truths on
which men professed to bind their
hopes of an eternal hereafter?</p>

<p>One afternoon of one of those
real English summer days that
when they come are so balmy and
bright and joyous, while sauntering
through the churchyard, I lighted
upon a figure half buried in the
long grass, so deeply intent on deciphering
the inscription around
the tomb of my ancestor that he
did not notice my approach. There
he lay, his hat by his side, and an
open sketch-book near it, peering
into the dim, old, half-effaced characters
as curiously as ever did alchemist
of eld into an old black-letter
volume. His years could not
be many more than mine. His form
would equally attract the admiration
of a lady or a prize-fighter.
The sign of ruddy health burned
on the bronzed cheek. The dress
had nothing particular in it to stamp
the character of the wearer. The
sketch-book and his absorbing interest
in the grim old characters
around a tomb might denote the
enthusiasm of an artist, or of an antiquarian
like my father, though he
looked too full of the robust life of
careless youth for the one, and too
evidently in the enjoyment of life
as it was for the other. Altogether
a man that, encountered thus in a
country churchyard on a warm
July afternoon, would at once excite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the interest and attract the attention
of a passer-by.</p>

<p>While I was mentally noting
down, running up, and calculating
to a nicety the sum of his qualities,
the expression of his face indicated
that he was engaged in a hopeless
task. “I can make all out about
the old Crusader except the date,
and that is an all-important point.
The date&mdash;the date&mdash;the date,” he
repeated to himself aloud. “I wonder
what Crusade he fought in?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I could assist you,” I
broke in. “Sir Roger Herbert followed
the good King Edward to the
Holy Land, and for the sake of
Christ’s dear rood made many a
proud painim to bite the dust.
So saith the old chronicle of the
Abbey of S. Wilfrid which you see
still standing&mdash;the modernized version
of it, at least&mdash;on yonder hill.
The present abbot of S. Wilfrid is
the florid gentleman who has just
saluted me. That handsome lady
beside him is the abbot’s wife. The
two pretty girls seated opposite are
the abbot’s daughters. The good
and gentle Abbot Jones is taking
the fair abbess, Mrs. Jones, out for
her afternoon airing. She is a very
amiable lady; he is a very genial
gentleman, and the author of the
pamphlet in reply to Maitland’s
<cite>Dark Ages</cite>. Mr. Jones is very
severe on the laziness and general
good-for-nothingness of the poor
monks.”</p>

<p>My companion, who still remained
stretched on the grass,
scanned my face curiously and with
an amused glance while I spoke.
He seemed lost in a half-revery,
from which he did not recover until
a few moments after I had ceased
speaking. With sudden recollection,
he said:</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, I was thinking
of something else. Many thanks
for your information about this old
hero, whom the new train of ideas,
called up by your mention of the
Abbot Jones and his family, drove
out of my mind a moment. The
Abbot Jones!” he laughed. “It
is very funny. Yet why do the
two words seem so little in keeping?”</p>

<p>“It is because, as my father
would tell you, this is the century
of the Joneses. Centuries ago Abbot
Jones would have sounded just
as well and as naturally as did
Queen Joan. But, in common with
many another good thing, the name
has become vulgarized by a vulgar
age.”</p>

<p>My companion glanced at me
curiously again, and seemed more
inwardly amused than before, whether
with me or at me, or both, it was
impossible to judge from his countenance,
though that was open
enough. He turned from the abbot
to the tomb again.</p>

<p>“And so this old hero,” said he,
patting affectionately the peaked
toe of the figure of Sir Roger, “drew
his sword long ago for Christ’s dear
rood, and probably scaled the walls
of Damietta at the head of a lusty
band. What a doughty old fellow
he must have been! I should have
been proud to have shaken hands
with him.”</p>

<p>“Should you, indeed? Then perhaps
you will allow a remote relative
of that doughty old fellow to
act as his unworthy representative
in his absence?” said I, offering my
hand.</p>

<p>“Why, you don’t mean to say that
you are a descendant of the old
knight whose ashes consecrate this
spot!” he exclaimed, rising and
grasping me by the hand. “Sir, I
am happy to lay my hand in that
of a son of a Crusader!”</p>

<p>“I fear I may not claim so high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
a character. There are no Crusaders
left. Myself, and Sir Roger
here, move in different circles. You
forget that a few centuries roll between
us.”</p>

<p>“Centuries change the fashion
of men’s garments,” he responded
quickly, “not the fashion of their
hearts. Truth is truth, and faith
faith, and honor honor, now as
when this warrior fought for faith,
and truth, and honor. The crusades
end only with the cross and
faith in Christ.”</p>

<p>So spake with fervent accent
and kindling glance the gentleman
whom a few moments before I had
set down as one eminently fitted
to attract the admiration alike of
lady or prize-fighter. The words
struck me as so strange, spoken in
such a place and by such a person,
that I was silent a little, and he also.
At length I said:</p>

<p>“You are like my father. You
seem to prefer the old to the new.”</p>

<p>“Not so; I am particularly grateful
that I was born in this and in
no other century. But I object to
the enthusiasm that would leave all
the dead past to bury its dead.
There were certain things, certain
qualities in the centuries gone by,
a larger faith, a more general fervor,
a loyalty to what was really
good and great, more universal than
prevails to-day, that we might have
preserved with benefit to ourselves
and to generations to come. But
pardon me. You have unfortunately
hit upon one of my hobbies, and
I could talk for hours on the subject.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I ought to feel
flattered at finding one interested
even in so remote a relative of
mine as Sir Roger. As I look at
him this moment the thought comes
to me, could he bend those stiff old
knees of his, hardened by the centuries
into triple stone, rise up and
walk through Leighstone, live a
week among us, question us, know
our thoughts, feelings, aspirations,
religions, ascertain all that we have
profited by the centuries that have
rolled over this tomb, he would, after
one week of it all, gather his old
joints together and go back to his
quiet rest until that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">‘Tuba mirum spargens sonum</div>

<div class="verse">Coget omnes ante thronum.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I can’t help laughing at the
conceit. Imagine me escorting this
stiff and stony old Sir Roger
through the streets of Leighstone,
and introducing him to my relations
and friends as my grandfather some
six centuries removed. But the
fancy sounds irreverent to one
whom I doubt not was as loyal-hearted
a gentleman as ever clove
a Turk to the chine. Poor old Sir
Roger! I must prevent Mattock
making such constant use of his
elbow. It is getting quite out of
repair.”</p>

<p>“Who is Mattock, may I ask?”</p>

<p>“Mattock is a character in his
way. He is the Leighstone grave-digger,
and has been as long as I
can remember. He claims a kind
of fellowship with those he buries,
and he has buried a whole generation
of Leighstonites, till a contagious
hump has risen on his back
from the number of mounds he has
raised. He is a cynic in his way,
and can be as philosophic over a
skull as Hamlet in the play. He
has a wonderful respect, almost a
superstitious regard, for Sir Roger.
Whenever he strips for a burial, he
commends his goods to the care of
my ancestor, accompanied always
by the same remark: ‘I wonder
who laid thee i’ the airth? A
weighty corpse thou, a warrant. A
deep grave thine, old stone-beard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Well, lend’s your elbow, and here’s
to ye, wherever ye may be.’ Mattock
takes special care to fortify
himself against possible contingencies
with a dram. ‘Cold corpses,’
he says, ‘is unhealthy. They are
apt to lie heavy on the stomick, if
ye doant guard agin ’em; corpses
doos. So doos oysters. A dram
afore burial and another dram after
keeps off the miasmys.’ Such is
Mattock’s opinion, backed up by an
experience of a quarter of a century.
You are evidently a stranger in this
neighborhood?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was merely passing
through. I am enjoying a walking
tour, being a great walker. It is by
far the best method of seeing a
country. When in the course of
my wanderings I come across an
old tomb such as this, an old inscription,
or anything at all that was
wrought or writ by reverent hands
centuries ago, and has survived
through the changes of time, I am
amply repaid for a day’s march.
Doubly so in this instance, since it
has been the fortunate means of
bringing me in contact with one
whose opinions I am happy to
think run in many things parallel
with my own. And now to step
out of the past into the very vulgar
present, I am staying at the ‘Black
Bull.’ The ‘Black Bull,’ I am assured,
is famous for his larder, so
that, if you feel inclined to ripen the
acquaintance begun by the grave
of your ancestor, in the interior of
the ‘Black Bull,’ Kenneth Goodal
will consider that he has fallen on
an exceptionally happy day.”</p>

<p>“Kenneth Goodal?” The name
struck me as familiar; but I could
not recollect at the moment where
I had heard it before. I repeated
it aloud.</p>

<p>“It sounds quite a romantic
name, does it not? It was my absurd
mother who insisted on the
Kenneth, after a Scotch uncle of
mine. For that matter I suppose
it was she who also insisted on the
Goodal. At least my father says
so. But she is the sweetest of
women to have her own way, Heaven
bless her! Of course I had no
voice in the matter at all, beyond
the generic squeal of babyhood.
Had I been consulted, I should
have selected Jack, a jolly, rough-and-ready
title. It carries a sort
of slap-me-on-the-back sound with
it. One is never surprised at a
Jack getting into scrapes or getting
out of them. But it would cause
very considerable surprise to hear
that a Kenneth had been caught
in any wild enterprise. However,
Kenneth I am, and Kenneth I must
remain, as staid and respectable as
a policeman on duty by very force
of title.”</p>

<p>“Now I remember where I heard
the name. There were traditions
at Dr. Porteous’, at Kingsclere, of a
Kenneth Goodal who had just left
before I went there. But he can’t
have been you.”</p>

<p>“No? Why not?”</p>

<p>“He was an awful scape-grace,
they told me. He used to play
all kinds of tricks on the masters,
though as great a favorite with
them as with the boys. He was a
great mimic, and Dr. Porteous, who
is as solemn as an undertaker at a
rich man’s funeral, and as pompous
as a parish beadle, surprised
Kenneth Goodal one day, surrounded
by a delighted crowd, listening
with such rapt attention to a highly
wrought discourse, after the doctor’s
best manner, on the history
and philosophy of Resurrection
Pie, that it required the unmistakable
‘ahem!’ of the doctor at
the close to announce to actor and
audience the presence of the original.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
The doctor in the grand old-school
manner congratulated the
youthful Roscius on talents of
whose existence he had been hitherto
unaware, and hinted that a repetition
of so successful a performance
might encourage him to seek
a wider field for so promising a pupil.
And when the same Kenneth
thrashed the Kingsclere Champion
for beating one of the youngsters,
bribing the policeman not to interfere
until he had finished him, the
doctor, who was a model of decorum,
had him up before the whole
college, and delivered an address
that is not quite forgotten to this
day; acknowledging the credit to
the establishment of such a champion
in their midst; a young gentleman
who could mimic his superiors
until his identity was lost, and pummel
his inferiors until their identity
was lost, was wasting his great natural
gifts in so narrow an arena;
and so on&mdash;all delivered in the
doctor’s best Ciceronian style. It
took a deputation of all the masters
and all the boys together to
beg the delinquent off a rustication
or worse. In fact, the stories of
him and his deeds are endless.
How odd that you should have the
same name!”</p>

<p>My new acquaintance laughed
outright.</p>

<p>“I fear I must lay claim to more
than the name; that historical personage
stands before you. I was
with Dr. Porteous for a couple of
years, and had no idea that I left
such fame behind me. The doctor
and I became the best of friends after
my departure. And so you and
I are, in a manner, old school-fellows?
How happy I am to have
fallen across you. But, come; the
‘Black Bull’ is waiting.”</p>

<p>“By the elbow of mine ancestor,
nay. Such dishonor may not come
upon the Herberts. Why, Sir Roger
here would rise from his tomb
at the thought and denounce me
in the market-place. You must
come with me. Dinner is ready by
this time. Come as you are. My
father will like you. He likes any
one who is interested in his ancestors.
And my sister, who, since my
mother’s death, is mistress of the
house and mistress of us all, shall
answer for herself.”</p>

<p>“So be it,” he said, and we passed
under the yews, their sad
branches flushed in the sun, out
through the gate, under the old
archway with its mouldering statues,
up the pretty straggling road
that formed the High Street of
Leighstone, arm in arm together,
fast friends we each of us felt,
though but acquaintances of an
hour. The instinct that out of a
multitude selects one, though you
may scarcely know his name, and
tells you that one is your friend, is
as strange as unerring. It was this
unconscious necromancy that had
woven a mesh of golden threads
caught from the summer sunlight
around us as we moved along. Its
influence was upon us, breathing in
the perfumed air. I had never had
a real friend of my own age before,
and I hailed this one as the discovery
of a life-time. We should
strike out together, tread the same
path, be it rough or smooth, arm in
arm until the end come. Damon
and Pythias would be nothing to
us. The same loves, the same
hates, the same hopes, were to guide,
animate, and sustain us. Castles
in the air! Castles in the air!
Who has not built them? Who
among the sons of men in the
neighborhood of twenty summers
has not chosen one man out of
thousands, leant upon him, cherished
him, made him his idol, loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
him above all? And so it goes on,
until some day comes a laughing
eye peeping from under a bonnet,
and with one dart the bosom friendship
is smitten through and through,
and Damon is ready to sacrifice a
hecatomb of his Pythiases on the
altar of the ox-eyed goddess.</p>

<h3>THE TRAGEDY OF THE TEMPLE.</h3>

<p>History is like a prison-house,
of which Time is the only jailer
who can reveal the secrets. And
Father Time is slow to speak.
Sometimes he is strangely dumb
concerning events of deep importance,
sometimes idly garrulous
about small matters. When now
and then he reveals some long-kept
secret, we refuse to believe him;
we cannot credit that such things
ever happened on this planet of
ours, so respectable in its civilized
humanity, so tenderly zealous for
the welfare and freedom of its remotest
members. But this same
humanity is a riddle to which our
proudest philosophers have not yet
found the clew. It moves mountains
to deliver an oppressed mouse, and
sits mute and apathetic while a nation
of weak brothers is being
hunted to death by a nation of
strong ones in the midst of its
universal brotherhood; seeing the
most sacred principles and highest
interests of the world attacked and
imperilled, and the earth shaken
with throes and rendings that will
bring forth either life or death, exactly
as humanity shall decide, and
yet not moving a finger either way.
Then, when the storm is over and it
beholds the wreck caused by its own
apathy or stupidity, it fills the world
with an “agony of lamentation,”
gnashes its teeth, and protests that
it slept, and knew not that these
things were being done in its name.</p>

<p>Sometimes the funeral knell of
the victims goes on echoing like a
distant thunder-tone for a whole
generation, and is scarcely heeded,
until at last some watcher hearkens,
and wakes us up, and, lo! we find
that a tragedy has been enacted at
our door, and the victim has been
crying out piteously for help while
we slumbered. History is full of
these slumberings and awakenings.
What an awakening for France was
that when, after the lapse of two generations,
the jailer struck the broken
stones of the Temple, and gave
them a voice to tell their story,
bidding all the world attend!</p>

<p>The account of the imprisonment
and death of Louis XVII. had
hitherto come down to his people
stripped of much of its true character,
and clothed with a mistiness
that disguised the naked horror of
the truth, and flattered the sensitive
vanity of the nation into the belief&mdash;or
at any rate into the plausible
hope&mdash;that much had been exaggerated,
and that the historians of
those times had used too strong
colors in portraying the sufferings
of the son of their murdered king.
The <i lang="fr">Grande Nation</i> had been always
grand; she had had her hour of
delirium, and run wild in anarchy
and chaos while it lasted; but she
had never disowned her essential
greatness, never forfeited her humanity,
the grandeur of her mission
as the eldest daughter of the
church of Christ, and the apostle of
civilization among the peoples. The
demon in man’s shape, called Simon
the Cordwainer, had disgraced
his manhood by torturing a feeble,
inoffensive child committed to his
mercy, but he alone was responsible.
The governing powers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
time were in total ignorance of his
proceedings; France had no share in
the blame or the infamy. The sensational
legend of the Temple was bad
enough, but at its worst no one was
responsible but Simon, a besotted
shoemaker. It was even hinted
that the Dauphin had been rescued,
and had not died in the Tower
at all, and many tender-hearted
Frenchmen clung long and tenaciously
to this fiction. But at the appointed
time one man, at the bidding
of the great Secret-Teller, stood
forth and tore away the veil, and
discovered to all the world the things
that had been done, not by Simon
the Cordwainer, but by the <i lang="fr">Grande
Nation</i> in his person. M. de Beauchesne<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
was that man, and nobly,
because faithfully and inexorably,
he fulfilled his mission. It was a
fearful message that he had to deliver,
and there is no doubt but that
his work&mdash;the result of twenty
years’ persevering research and
study&mdash;moved the hearts of his
countrymen as no book had ever
before moved them. It made an
end once and for ever of garbled
narratives, and comforting fables,
and bade the guilty nation look
upon the deeds she had done, and
atone for them with God’s help as
best she might.</p>

<p>In reading the records of those
mad times one ceases to wonder at
recent events. They give the key to
all subsequent crimes and wanderings.
A nation that deliberately,
in cold, premeditated hate and full
wakefulness of reason, decrees by
law in open court that God does
not exist, and forthwith abolishes
him by act of parliament&mdash;a nation
that does this commits itself to the
consequences. France did this in
the National Convention of 1793,
and why should she not pay the
penalty?</p>

<p>Of all the victims of that bloody
period, there is none whose story
is so touching as that of the little
son of Louis and Marie Antoinette.
He was born at Versailles
on the 27th of March, 1785. All
eye-witnesses describe him as a
bright and lovely child, with shining
curls of fair hair, large, blue
eyes, liquid as a summer sky, and a
countenance of angelic sweetness
and rare intelligence&mdash;“a thing of
joy” to all who beheld him.
Crowds waited for hours to catch a
glimpse of him disporting himself
in his little garden before the palace,
a flower amidst the flower-beds,
prattling with every one, making
the old park ring with his joyous
laughter. One day, when in the
midst of his play, he ran to meet
his mother, and, flinging himself
into a bush for greater haste, got
scratched by the thorns; the queen
chided him for the foolish impetuosity.
“How then?” replied the child;
“you told me only yesterday that
the road to glory was through
thorns.” “Yes, but glory means devotion
to duty, my son,” was Marie
Antoinette’s reply. “Then,” cried
the little man, throwing his arms,
round her knees, “I will make it
my glory to be devoted to you,
mamma!” He was about four
years old when this anecdote was
told of him.</p>

<p>It is rather characteristic of the
child’s destiny that two hours after
the bereavement which made him
Dauphin of France, and while his
parents were breaking their hearts
by the still warm body of his elder
brother, a deputation from the Tiers
Etat came to demand an audience
of the king. Louis XVI. was a
prey to the first agony of his paternal
grief, and sent to entreat the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
deputies to spare him, and return
another day. They sent back an
imperious answer, insisting on his
appearing. “Are there no fathers
amongst them?” exclaimed the
king; but he came out and received
them. The incident was trifling,
yet it held one of those notes of
prophetic anticipation which now
first began to be heard, foretelling
the approaching storm in which the
old ship of French royalty was to
be wrecked.</p>

<p>On the 6th of October the palace of
Versailles was stormed by the mob;
the guards were massacred, the
royal family led captives to Paris
amidst the triumphant yells of the
<i lang="fr">sans-culottes</i>. Then followed the
gilded captivity of the Tuileries,
which lasted three years; then came
the 10th of August, when this was
exchanged for the more degrading
prison of the Temple; then the
<i lang="fr">Conciergerie</i>&mdash;then the scaffold.</p>

<p>The Temple was a Gothic fortress
built in 1212 by the Knights of the
Temple. It had been long inhabited
by those famous warrior-knights,
and consisted of two distinct towers,
which were so constructed as to resemble
one building. The great
tower was a massive structure divided
into five or six stories, above a
hundred and fifty feet high, with a
pyramidal roof like an extinguisher,
having at each corner a turret with
a conical roof like a steeple. This
was formerly the keep, and had
been used as treasury and arsenal
by the Templars; it was accessible
only by a single door in one turret,
opening on a narrow stone stair.
The other was called the Little
Tower, a narrow oblong with turrets
at each angle, and attached, without
any internal communication, to
its big neighbor on the north side.
Close by, within the enclosure of
the Temple, stood an edifice which
had in olden times been the dwelling-house
of the prior, and it was
here the royal family were incarcerated
on their arrival. The place
was utterly neglected and dilapidated,
but from its construction
and original use it was capable of
being made habitable. The king
believed that they were to remain
here, and visited the empty, mouldy
rooms next day, observing to Cléry
what changes and repairs were most
urgently required. No such luxurious
prospect was, however, in
store for them. They were merely
huddled into the Prior’s Hotel
while some preparations were being
made for their reception in the
tower. These preparations consisted
in precautions, equally formidable
and absurd, against possible
rescue or flight. The heavy oak
doors, the thick stone walls, which
had proved safe enough for murderers
and rebel warriors, were not
considered secure for the timid
king and his wife and children.
Doors and windows were reinforced
with iron bars, bolts, and wooden
blinds. The corkscrew stair was
So narrow that only one person
could pass it at a time, yet new
iron-plated doors were put up, and
bars thrown across it at intervals,
to prevent escape. The door
leading from it into the royal prisoners’
apartment was so low that
when Marie Antoinette was dragged
from her children, after the
king’s death, to be taken to the
<i lang="fr">Conciergerie</i>, she knocked her head
violently against the upper part of
it, exclaiming to some one who
hoped she was not hurt, “Nothing
can hurt me now!” The Abbé
Edgeworth thus describes the access
to the king’s rooms: “I was
led across the court to the door of
the tower, which, though very narrow
and very low, was so overcharged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
with iron bolts and bars
that it opened with a horrible
noise. I was conducted up a winding
stair so narrow that two persons
would have had great difficulty
in getting past each other. At
short distances these stairs were cut
across by barriers, at each of which
was a sentinel; these men were all
true <i lang="fr">sans-culottes</i>, generally drunk,
and their atrocious exclamations,
re-echoed by the vast vaults which
covered every story of the tower,
were really terrifying.” For still
greater security all the adjoining
buildings which crowded round the
tower were thrown down. This
work of destruction was entrusted
to Palloy, a zealous patriot, whose
energy in helping to pull down the
Bastile pointed him out as a fit instrument
for the occasion. These
external arrangements fitly symbolized
the systematic brutality which
was organized from the first by the
Convention, and relentlessly carried
out by its agents on each succeeding
victim, but by no one so ferociously
as Simon the shoemaker.
The most appalling riddle which
the world has yet set us to solve is
the riddle of the French Revolution.
The deepest thinkers, the
shrewdest philosophers, are puzzling
over it still, and will go on puzzling
to the crack of doom. There are
causes many and terrible which explain
the grand fact of the nation’s
revolt itself; why, when once the
frenzy broke out, the people murdered
the king, and butchered all
belonging to him, striving to bring
about a new birth, a different order
of things, by a baptism of blood,
the death and annihilation of the
old system&mdash;many wise and solemn
words have been uttered concerning
these things, many answers
which, if they do not justify the
madness of the Revolution, help us
to pity, and in a measure excuse,
its actors; but the enigma which
no one has ever yet solved, or attempted
to solve, is the excess of
cruelty practised on the fair-haired
child whose sole crime was his
misfortune in being the descendant
of the kings of France.</p>

<p>The Princesse de Lamballe fell on
the 3d of September at the prison of
La Force. The National Guards
carried the head on a pike through
the city, and then hoisted it under
the windows of the king, and clamored
for him to come out and
show himself. One young officer,
more humane than his compeers,
rushed forward and prevented it,
and saved Louis from beholding
the dreadful spectacle. The king
was deeply grateful for the kind
action, and asked the officer’s
name. “And who was the other
who tried to force your majesty
out?” enquired M. de Malesherbes.
“Oh! I did not care to know
his name!” replied Louis gently.
That was a night of horrors. The
two princesses, Mme. Royale and
Princess Elizabeth, could not sleep;
the drums were beating to arms,
and they sat in silence, “listening
to the sobs of the queen, which
never ceased.” But more cruel
days were yet in store. Before
the month was out the Commune
de Paris issued a decree for the
separation of the king from his
wife and children. “They felt it,”
says this curious document, “their
imperious duty to prevent the abuses
which might facilitate the evasion
of those traitors, and therefore
decree, 1st, that Louis and Antoinette
be separated.</p>

<p>“2d. That each shall have a separate
dungeon (<i lang="fr">cachot</i>).</p>

<p>“3d. That the <i lang="fr">valet de chambre</i>
be placed in confinement, etc., etc.”</p>

<p>That same night the king was removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to the second story of the
great tower. The room was in a
state of utter destitution; no preparations
of the commonest description
had been made for receiving him. A
straw bed was thrown down on the
floor; Cléry, his <i lang="fr">valet</i>, had not even
this, but sat up all night on a chair.
A month later (October) the queen
and her children were transferred
to the story over that now occupied
by Louis in the great tower. On
the 26th the Dauphin was torn from
his mother under the pretence that
he was now too old to be left to the
charge of women, being just seven
years and six months. He was
therefore lodged with his father, who
found his chief solace in teaching
the child his lessons; these consisted
of Latin, writing, arithmetic,
geography, and history. The separation
was for the present mitigated
by the consolation of meeting
at meal-times, and being allowed to
be together for some hours in the
garden every day. They bore all
privations and the insults of their
jailers with unruffled patience and
sweetness. Mme. Elizabeth and
the queen sat up at night to mend
their own and the king’s clothes,
which the fact of their each having
but one suit made it impossible for
them to do in the daytime.</p>

<p>This comparatively merciful state
of things lasted till the first week in
December, when a new set of commissaries
were appointed and the
captives watched day and night
with lynx-eyed rigor. On the 11th
the prince was taken back to his
mother, the king was summoned to
the bar of the Convention, and on
his return to prison was informed
that he was henceforth totally separated
from his family. He never
saw them again until the eve of his
death. The Duchesse d’Angoulême
(Mme. Royale) has described
that interview to us with her usual
simplicity and pathos: “My father,
at the moment of parting with us
for ever, made us promise never to
think of avenging his death. He
was well satisfied that we should
hold sacred his last instructions;
but the extreme youth of my brother
made him desirous of producing
a still stronger impression upon
him. He took him on his knee, and
said to him, ‘My son, you have
heard what I have said, but, as an
oath is something more sacred than
words, hold up your hand and swear
that you will accomplish the last
wish of your father.’ My brother
obeyed, bursting into tears, and
this touching goodness redoubled
ours.”</p>

<p>The next day Louis had gone to
receive the reward promised to the
merciful, to those who return love
for hate, blessings for curses. When
the guillotine had done its work,
the shouts of the infuriated city
announced to the queen that she
was a widow. Her agony was inconsolable.
In the afternoon of
this awful day she asked to see
Cléry, hoping that he might have
some message for her from the king,
with whom he had remained till his
departure from the Temple. She
guessed right; the faithful servant
had been entrusted with a ring,
which the king desired him to deliver
to her with the assurance that
he never would have parted with it
but with his life. But Cléry was not
allowed the mournful privilege of
fulfilling his trust in person; he was
kept a month in the Temple, and
then released. “We had now
a little more freedom,” continues
Mme. Royale. “The guards even
believed that we were about to be
sent out of France; but nothing
could calm the agony of the queen.
No hope could touch her heart;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
life was indifferent to her, and she
did not fear death.”</p>

<p>Her son, meanwhile, had nominally
become King of France. The
armies of La Vendée proclaimed
him as Louis XVII., under the regency
of his uncle, the Comte de
Provence. He was King of France
everywhere except in France, where
he was the victim of a blind ferocity
unexampled in the history of the
most wicked periods of the world.</p>

<p>The “freedom” which the Duchesse
d’Angoulême speaks of lasted
but a few days; the royal family
were all now in the queen’s apartment,
but kept under, if possible,
more rigid and humiliating supervision
than before. Their only attendants
were a certain Tison and
his wife, who had hitherto been employed
in the most menial household
work of the Temple. They were
coarse and ignorant by nature, and
soon the confinement to which they
were themselves condemned so soured
their temper that they grew cruel
and insolent, and avenged their
own privations on their unhappy
prisoners. They denounced three
of the municipals whom they detected
in some signs of respect and
sympathy for the queen, and these
men were all guillotined on the
strength of the Tisons’ evidence.
The woman went mad with remorse
when she beheld the mischief
her denunciations had done. At first
she sank into a black melancholy.
Marie Antoinette and the Princess
Elizabeth attended on her, and did
their utmost to soothe her during
the first stage of the malady; but
their gentle charity was like coals
of fire on the head of their persecutor.
She soon became furious, and
had to be carried away by force to
a mad-house.</p>

<p>About the 6th of May the young
prince fell ill. The queen was alarmed,
and asked to see M. Brunier,
his ordinary physician; the request
was met with a mocking reply, and
no further notice taken of it, until
the child’s state became so serious
that the prison doctor was ordered
by the Commune to go and see
what was amiss with him. The
doctor humanely consulted M. Brunier,
who was well acquainted with
the patient’s constitution, and otherwise
did all that was in his power
to alleviate his condition. This
was not much, but the queen and
Mme. Elizabeth, who for three
weeks never left the little sufferer’s
pillow, were keenly alive to the kindness
of the medical man. This illness
made no noise outside the Temple
walls; but Mme. Royale always
declared that her brother had never
really recovered from it, and that
it was the first stage of the disease
which ultimately destroyed him.
The government had hitherto been
too busy with more important matters
to have leisure to attend to
such a trifle as the life or death of
“little Capet.” It was busy watching
and striving to control the struggle
between the Jacobins and the
Girondists, which ended finally in
the overthrow of the latter. On the
9th of July, however, it suddenly
directed its notice to the young
captive, and issued a decree ordering
him to be immediately separated
from Antoinette, and confided to a
tutor (<i lang="fr">instituteur</i>), who should be
chosen by the nation. It was ten
o’clock at night when six commissaries,
like so many birds of ill-omen,
entered the Temple, and ascended
the narrow, barricaded stairs
leading to the queen’s rooms. The
young prince was lying fast asleep
in his little curtainless bed, with a
shawl suspended by tender hands
to shade him from the light on the
table, where his mother and aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
sat mending their clothes. The
men delivered their message in loud
tones; but the child slept on. It
was only when the queen uttered a
great cry of despair that he awoke,
and beheld her with clasped hands
praying to the commissaries. They
turned from her with a savage laugh,
and approached the bed to seize
the prince. Marie Antoinette,
quicker than thought, flew towards
it, and, clasping him in her arms,
clung despairingly to the bed-post.
One of the men was about to use
violence in order to seize the boy,
but another stayed his hand, exclaiming:
“It does not become us
to fight with women; call up the
guard!” Horror-stricken at the
threat, Mme. Elizabeth cried out:
“No, for God’s sake, no! We submit,
we cannot resist; but give us
time to breathe. Let the child sleep
out the night here. He will be delivered
to you to-morrow.” This prayer
was spurned, and then the queen
entreated as a last mercy that her
son might remain in the tower, where
she might still see him. A commissary
retorted brutally, <i lang="fr">tutoyant</i>
her, “What! you make such a to-do
because, forsooth, you are separated
from your child, while our children
are sent to the frontiers to have their
brains knocked out by the bullets
which you bring upon us!” The
princesses now began to dress the
prince; but never was there such a
long toilet in this world. Every article
was passed from one to another,
put on, taken off again, and replaced
after being drenched with tears.
The commissaries were losing patience.
“At last,” says Mme. Royale,
the queen, gathering up all her
strength, placed herself in a chair,
with the child standing before her,
put her hands on his little shoulders,
and, without a tear or a sigh,
said with a grave and solemn voice,
“My child, we are about to part.
Bear in mind all I have said to you
of your duties when I shall be no
longer near to repeat it. Never forget
God, who thus tries you, nor your
mother, who loves you. Be good,
patient, kind, and your father will
look down from heaven and bless
you.” Having said this, she kissed
him and handed him to the
commissaries. One of them said:
“Come, I hope you have done with
your sermonizing; you have abused
our patience finely.” Another
dragged the boy out of the room,
while a third added: “Don’t be uneasy;
the nation will take care of
him!” Then the door closed.
Take care of him! Not even in
that hour of supreme anguish, quickened
as her imagination was by past
and present experience of the nation’s
“care,” could his mother
have pictured to herself what sort
of guardianship was in preparation
for her son. That night which saw
him torn from her arms and from beneath
the protecting shadow of her
immense love, beheld the little King
of France transferred to the pitiless
hands of Simon and his wife.</p>

<p>Simon was a thick-set, black-visaged
man of fifty-eight years of
age. He worked as a shoemaker
next door to Marat, whose patronage
procured for him the office of
“tutor” to the son of Louis XVI.
His wife is described as an ill-favored
woman of the same age as her
husband, with a temper as sour and
irascible as his was vicious and
cruel. They got five hundred
francs a month for maltreating the
“little Capet,” whom Simon never
addressed except as “viper.”
“wolf-cub,” “poison-toad,” adding
kicks and blows as expletives.
For two days and nights the
child wept unceasingly, refusing to
eat or sleep, and crying out continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to be taken back to his
mother. He was starved and beaten
into sullen silence and a sort
of hopeless submission. If he showed
terror or surprise at a threat, it
was treated as insolent rebellion,
and he was seized and beaten as if
he had attempted a crime. All
this first month of Simon’s tutorship
the child was so ill as to be
under medical treatment. But this
was no claim on the tutor’s mercy;
if it had been, he would have been
unfitted for his task, and would not
have been chosen for it. He was
astonished, nevertheless, at the indomitable
spirit of his victim, at
the quiet firmness with which he
bore his treatment, and at the
perseverance with which he continued
to insist on being restored
to his mother. How long would it
take to break this royal “wolf-cub”?
Simon began to be perplexed
about it. He must have advice
from headquarters, and fuller liberty
for the exercise of his own ingenuity.
Four members of the
Committee of <i lang="fr">Sûreté Générale</i> betook
themselves to the Temple, and
there held a conference with the
patriot shoemaker which remains
one of the most curious incidents
of those wonderful days. Amongst
the four councillors was Drouet, the
famous post-master of Sainte Ménéhould,
and Chabot, an apostate
monk. One of the others related
the secret conference to Sénart,
secretary of the committee, who thus
transcribed it at the time: “Citizens,”
asks Simon, “what do you
decide as to the treatment of the
wolf-cub? He has been brought
up to be insolent. I can tame him,
but I cannot answer that he will
not sink under it (<i lang="fr">crever</i>). So
much the worse for him; but, after
all, what do you mean to do with
him? To banish him?” Answer:
“No.” “To kill him?” “No.”
“To poison him?” “No.” “But
what, then?” “<em>To get rid of him</em>”
(<i lang="fr">s’en défaire</i>).</p>

<p>From this forth the severity of
Simon knew no bounds but those
of his own fiendish powers of invention.
He applied his whole energies
to the task of “doing away
with” the poor child. He made
him slave like a dog at the most laborious
and menial work; he was
shoe-black, turnspit, drudge, and
victim at once. Not content with
thus degrading him, Simon insisted
that the boy should wear the red
cap as an external badge of degradation.
The republican symbol was
no doubt associated in the child’s
mind with the bloody riots of the
year before; for the mere sight of it
filled him with terror, and nothing
that his jailer could say or do could
persuade him to let it be placed on
his head. Simon, exasperated by
such firmness in one so frail and
young, fell upon him and flogged
him unmercifully, until at last Mme.
Simon, who every now and then
showed that the woman was not
quite dead within her, interfered to
rescue the boy, declaring that it
made her sick to see him beaten in
that way. But she hit upon a mode
of punishment which, though more
humane, proved more crushing to
the young captive than either
threats or blows. His fair hair, in
which his mother had taken such
fond pride, still fell long and unkempt
about his shoulders. Mme.
Simon declared that this was unseemly
in the little Capet, and that
he should be shorn like a son of
the people. She forthwith proceeded
to cut off the offending curls,
and in a moment, before he realized
what she was about to do, the
shining locks lay strewn at his feet.
The effect was terrible; the child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
uttered a piteous cry, and then
lapsed into a state of sullen despair.
All spirit seemed to have died out
of him; and when Simon, perceiving
this, again approached him with
the hated cap, he made no resistance,
gave no sign, but let it be placed
on his little shorn head in silence.
The shabby black clothes that he
wore by way of mourning for his
father were now taken off, and replaced
by a complete <i lang="fr">Carmagnole</i>
costume; still Louis offered no opposition.
He was taken out for exercise
on the leads every day, and,
to prevent the queen having the
miserable satisfaction of catching a
glimpse of him on these occasions,
a wooden partition had been run
up; it was loosely put together,
however, and Mme. Elizabeth
discovered a chink through which
it was possible to see the captive
as he passed. Marie Antoinette
was filled with thankfulness
when she heard of this, and
overcoming her reluctance to leave
her room, from which she had
never stirred since the king’s death,
she now used every subterfuge for
remaining on the watch within
sight of the chink. At last, on the
20th of July, her patience was rewarded.
But what a spectacle it
was that met her gaze! Her beautiful,
fair-haired child, cropped as
if he had just recovered from a
fever, and dressed out in the odious
garb of his father’s murderers,
driven along by the brutal Simon,
and addressed in coarse and horrible
language. She was near enough
to hear it, to see the look of terror
and suffering on the child’s face as
he passed. Yet, such strength does
love impart to a mother in her
most trying needs, the queen was
able to see it all and remain mute
and still; she did not cry out, nor
faint, nor betray by a single movement
the horror that made her
very heart stand still, but, rising
slowly from the spot, returned to
her room. The shock had almost
paralyzed her, and she resolved
that nothing should ever tempt her
to renew it. But the longing of
the mother’s heart overcame all
other feelings. The next day she
returned to her watch-point, and
waited for hours until the little feet
were heard on the leads again, accompanied
as before by Simon’s
heavy tread and rough tones.
What Marie Antoinette must have
suffered during those few days,
when she beheld with her own eyes
and heard with her own ears the
sort of tutelage to which her innocent
child was subjected, God, and
perhaps a mother’s heart, alone can
tell. That young soul, whose purity
she had guarded as the very
apple of her eye, was now exposed
to the foulest influences; for prayers
and pious teachings he heard nothing
but blasphemy and curses;
his faith, that precious flower
which had been planted so reverently
and watered with such tender
care, what was to become of
it&mdash;what had become of it already?
None but God knew, and to God
alone did the mother look for help.
He who saved Daniel in the lions’
den and the children in the fiery
furnace was powerful to save his
own now, as then; he would save
her child, for man was powerless to
help. One of Simon’s diabolical
amusements was to force the prince
to use bad language and sing blasphemous
songs. Blows and threats
were unavailing so long as the boy
caught any part of the revolting
sense of the words; but at last, deceived
no doubt by the very grossness
of the expressions, and unable
to penetrate their meaning, he took
refuge from blows in compliance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and with his sweet childish treble
piped out songs that were never
heard beyond the precincts of a
tavern or a guard-house. The
queen heard this once. Angels
heard it, too, and, closing their ears
to the loathsome sounds, smiled
with angels’ pity on the unconscious
treason of their little kindred spirit.</p>

<p>But this new crisis of misery was
not of long duration to Marie
Antoinette. About three days after
her first vision of Simon and
his victim, the commissaries entered
her room in the dead of the night,
and read a decree, ordering them
to convey her to the <i lang="fr">Conciergerie</i>.
This was the first step of the scaffold.
The summons would have
been welcome to the widow of
Louis XVI., if she had not been a mother;
but she was, and the thought
of leaving her son in the hands of
men whose aim was not merely to
“slay the body,” but to destroy the
soul, made the prospect of her own
deliverance dreadful to contemplate.
But God was there&mdash;God,
who loved her son better and more
availingly than even she loved him.
She committed him once more to
God, and commended her daughter
to the tender and virtuous Elizabeth,
little dreaming that the same
fate which had befallen the brother
was soon to be awarded to the gentle,
inoffensive sister.</p>

<p>On the same day that the queen
was sent to the <i lang="fr">Conciergerie</i>, preparatory
to her execution, a member of
the Convention sent a toy guillotine
as a present to “the little
Capet,” doubtless with the merciful
design of acquainting the poor
child with his mother’s impending
fate. A subaltern officer in the
Temple, however, had the humanity
to intercept the fiendish present,
for the young prince never received
it. It was the fashion of the day
to teach children to play at beheading
sparrows, which were sold
on the boulevards with little guillotines,
by way of teaching them to
love the republic and to scorn
death. It is rather a curious coincidence
that Chaumette, the man
who sent the satanic toy to the
Dauphin, was himself decapitated
by it a year before the death of the
child whom he thought to terrify
by his cruel gift.</p>

<p>While the mock trial of the queen
was going on, Simon pursued more
diligently than ever his scheme of
demoralization. A design which
must first have originated in some
fiend’s brain had occurred to him,
and it was necessary to devise new
means for carrying it into execution.
He would make this spotless,
idolized child a witness against
his mother; the little hand which
hers had guided in forming its first
letters, and taught to lift itself in
prayer, should be made an instrument
in the most revolting calumny
which the human mind ever conceived.
Simon began to make the
boy drink; when he attempted to
refuse, the liquor was poured into
his mouth by force; until at last,
stupefied and unconscious of what
he was doing, unable to comprehend
the purpose or consequence
of the act, he signed his name to a
document in which the most heinous
accusations were brought
against his august mother. The
same deposition was presented to
his sister for her signature; but
without the same success. “They
questioned me about a thousand
terrible things of which they accused
my mother and my aunt,” says
Mme. Royale; “and, frightened as I
was, I could not help exclaiming
that they were wicked falsehoods.”
The examination lasted three hours,
for the deputies hoped that the extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
youth and timidity of the
princess would enable them to
compel her consent to sign the
paper; but in this they were mistaken.
“They forgot,” continues
Mme. Royale, “the life that I had
led for four years past, and, above all,
that the example shown me by my
parents had given me more energy
and strength of mind.” The queen’s
trial lasted two entire days and
nights without intermission. Not
a single accusation, political or
otherwise, was confirmed by a
feather’s weight of evidence. But
what did that signify? The judges
had decreed beforehand that she
must die. Hébert brought forward
the document signed by her
son; she listened in silent scorn,
and disdained to answer. One of the
paid assassins on the jury demanded
why she did not speak. The
queen, thus adjured, drew herself
up with all the majesty of outraged
motherhood, and, casting her eyes
over the crowded court, replied:
“<em>I did not answer; but I appeal to
the heart of every mother who hears
me</em>.” A low murmur ran through
the crowd. No mother raised her
voice in loyal sympathy with the
mother who appealed to them, but
the inarticulate response was too
powerful for the jury; they dropped
the subject, and when the counsel
nominally appointed for her defence
had done speaking, the president
demanded of the prisoner at the
bar whether she had anything to
add. There was a moment’s hush,
and then the queen spoke: “For
myself, nothing; for your consciences,
much! I was a queen, and you
dethroned me; I was a wife, and you
murdered my husband; I was a mother,
and you have torn my children
from me. I have nothing left but
my blood&mdash;make haste and take it!”</p>

<p>This last request was granted.
The trial ended soon after daybreak
on the third day, and at eleven
o’clock the same forenoon she
was led to the scaffold.</p>

<p>Seldom has retribution more
marked ever followed a crime, than
that which awaited the perpetrators
of this legal murder. Within nine
months from the death of Marie
Antoinette every single individual
known to have had any share in the
deed&mdash;judges, jury, witnesses, and
prosecutors&mdash;all perished on the
same guillotine to which they condemned
the queen.</p>

<p>The captives in the Temple knew
nothing either of the mock trial or
the death which followed it. It is
difficult to understand the motive
of this silence, especially as concerns
Simon. Perhaps it was owing
to his wife’s influence that the
young prince was spared the blow
of knowing that he was an orphan.
If so, it was the only act of mercy
she was able to obtain for him. The
brutalities of the jailer rather increased
than diminished after the
queen’s death. The child was locked
up alone in a room almost entirely
dark, and the gloom and solitude
reduced him to such a point
of despondency and apathy that few
hearts, even amongst the cruel men
about him, could behold the wretched
spectacle unmoved. One of the
municipals begged Simon’s leave to
give the poor child a little artificial
canary bird, which sang a song and
fluttered its wings. The toy gave
him such intense pleasure that the
man good-naturedly followed up the
opportunity of Simon’s mild mood
to bring a cage full of real canaries,
which he was likewise allowed to
give the little Capet. The birds
were tamed to come on his finger
and perch on his shoulder, and had
other pretty tricks which amused
and delighted the poor little fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
inexpressibly. He was very happy
in the society of his feathered friends
for some time, until one unlucky
day a new commissary came to inspect
his room, and, expressing
great surprise at “the son of the
tyrant” being allowed such an aristocratic
amusement, ordered the
cage to be instantly removed. Simon,
to atone for this passing weakness
towards the wolf-cub, set himself
to maltreat him more savagely
than ever. The child, in the midst
of the revolting atmosphere which
surrounded him, still cherished the
memory of his mother’s teaching;
he remembered the prayers she had
taught him, the lessons of love and
faith she had planted in his heart.
Simon had flogged him the first
time he saw him go down on his
knees to say his prayers, so the
child ever after went to bed and
got up without repeating the offence.
We may safely believe that he sent
up his heart to God morning and
night, nevertheless, though he did
not dare kneel while doing so. One
night, a bitter cold night in January,
Simon awoke, and, by the light
of the moon that stole in through
the wooden blind of the window,
beheld the boy kneeling up in his
bed, his hands clasped and his face
uplifted in prayer. He doubted at
first whether the child was awake
or asleep; but the attitude and all
that it suggested threw him into a
frenzy of superstitious rage; he took
up a large pitcher of water, icy cold
as it was, and flung it, pitcher and
all, at the culprit, exclaiming as he
did so, “I’ll teach you to get up
Pater-nostering at night like a Trappist!”
Not satisfied with this, he
seized his own shoe&mdash;a heavy wooden
shoe with great nails&mdash;and fell to
beating him with it, until Mme Simon,
terrified by his violence and
sickened by the cries of the victim,
rushed at her husband, and made
him desist. Louis, sobbing and
shivering, gathered himself up out
of the wet bed, and sat crouching
on the pillow; but Simon pulled
him down, and made him lie in
the soaking clothes, perishing and
drenched as he was. The shock
was so great that he never was the
same after this night; it utterly
broke the little spirit that yet remained
in him, and gave a blow to
his health which it never recovered.</p>

<h3>SUBSTANTIAL GENERATIONS.<br />
I.</h3>

<p>We have shown that the intrinsic
principles of the primitive material
substance are <em>the matter</em> and <em>the substantial
form</em>; and we have proved
that in the material element the
matter is a mere mathematical
point&mdash;the centre of a virtual
sphere&mdash;whilst the substantial form
which gives existence to such a centre
is an act, or an active principle,
having a spherical character, and
constituting a sphere of power all
around that centre, as shown by its
exertions directed all around in accordance
with the Newtonian law.
Hence the nature of the matter as
actuated by its substantial form,
and the nature of the substantial
form as terminated to its matter,
are fully determined.</p>

<p>It would seem that nothing remains
to be investigated about this
subject; for, when we have reached
the <em>first</em> constituent principles of a
given essence, the metaphysical
analysis is at an end. One question,
however, remains to be settled
between us and the philosophers
of the Aristotelic school concerning
the <em>mutual relation</em> of the matter and
the substantial form in a material
being. Is such a relation variable
or invariable? Is the matter separable
from any given substantial
form, as the Aristotelic theory assumes,
or are the matter and its
form so bound together as to form
a unit substantially unchangeable?
Can substantial forms be supplanted
and superseded by other substantial
forms, or do they continue
for ever as they were at the instant
of their creation?</p>

<p>Some of our readers may think
that what we have said in other preceding
articles suffices to settle the
question; for it is obvious that simple
material elements are substantially
unchangeable. But the peripatetic
school looked at things from
a different point of view, and
thought that the question was to be
solved by the consideration of the
potentiality of the <em>first matter</em> with
respect to all substantial forms.
Hence it is under this aspect that
their opinion is to be examined,
that a correct judgment may be
formed of the merits and deficiencies
of a system so long advocated
by the most celebrated philosophers.
For this reason, as also because
some modern writers have resuscitated
this system without taking notice
of its defects, and without making
such corrections as were required
to make it agree with the
positive sciences, we think it necessary
to examine the notions on
which the whole Aristotelic theory
is established, and the reasonings
by which it is supported, and to
point out the inaccuracies by which
some of those reasonings are spoiled,
as well as the limits within which
the conclusions of the school can
be maintained.</p>

<p><i lang="la">Materia prima.</i>&mdash;The notion of
“first matter,” which plays the principal
part in the theory of substantial
generations, has been the source
of many disputes among philosophers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Some, as Suarez, think that
the <i lang="la">materia prima</i> is metaphysically
constituted of act and potency;
others consider the <i lang="la">materia prima</i> as
a real potency only; whilst others
consider it as a mere potency of
being, and therefore as a non-entity.
The word “matter” can, in fact, be
used in three different senses.</p>

<p>First, it is used for <em>material substance</em>,
either compound or simple;
as when steel is said to be the matter
of a sword, or when the primitive
elements are said to be the
matter of a body. When taken in
this sense, the word “matter”
means a <em>physical</em> being, substantially
perfect, and capable of accidental
modifications.</p>

<p>Secondly, the word “matter” is
used for <em>the potential term lying under
the substantial form</em> by which it
is actuated. In this sense the matter
is a <em>metaphysical</em> reality which,
by completing its substantial form,
concurs with it to the constitution
of the physical being&mdash;that is, of
the substance. It is usually called
<i lang="la">materia formata</i>, or “formed matter.”</p>

<p>Thirdly, the word “matter” is
used also for <em>the potential term of
substance conceived as deprived of its
substantial form</em>. In this sense the
matter is a mere potency of being,
and therefore <em>a being of reason</em>; for
it cannot thus exist in the real order:
and it is then called <i lang="la">materia
informis</i>, or “unformed matter.”
It is, however, to be remarked that
the phrase <i lang="la">materia informis</i> has
been used by the fathers of the
church to designate the matter as it
came out of the hands of the Creator
before order, beauty, and harmony
were introduced into the material
world. Such a matter was
not absolutely without form, as is
evident.</p>

<p>Of the three opinions above mentioned
about the nature of <i lang="la">materia
prima</i>, the one maintained by Suarez
is, in the present state of physical
science, the most satisfactory,
though it can scarcely be said to
agree with the Aristotelic theory,
as commonly understood. Indeed,
if such a first matter is metaphysically
constituted of act and potency,
as he maintains, such a matter is
nothing less than a primitive substance,
as he also maintains; and
we may be allowed to add, on the
strength of the proofs given in our
preceding articles, that such a first
matter corresponds to our primitive
unextended elements, which,
though unknown to Suarez, are in
fact the <em>first</em> physical matter of
which all natural substances are
composed. But, if the first matter
involves a metaphysical act and
is a substance, such a matter cannot
be the subject of <em>substantial</em>
generation; for what is already in
act is not potential to the first act,
and what has already a first being
is not potential to the first being.
Hence we may conclude that the
first matter of Suarez excludes the
theory of rigorously substantial
generations, and leads to the conclusion
that the generated substances
are not new with respect to
their substance, but only with regard
to their compound essence,
and that the forms by which they
are constituted are indeed <em>essential</em>
to them, but not strictly <em>substantial</em>,
as we intend hereafter to explain.</p>

<p>The second interpretation of the
words <i lang="la">materia prima</i> is that given
by S. Thomas, when he considers
the first matter as “matter without
form,” and as a mere potency of
being. “The matter,” he says, “exists
sometimes under one form,
and at other times under another;
but it can never exist isolated&mdash;that
is, by itself&mdash;because, as it does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
involve in its ratio any form, it cannot
be in act (for the form is the
only source of actuality), but can
merely be in potency. And therefore,
<em>nothing which is in act can be
called first matter</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> From these
words it is evident that S. Thomas
considers the first matter as matter
without form; for, had it a form, it
would be in act, and would cease
to be called “first” matter. In
another place he says: “Since the
matter is a pure potency, it is <em>one</em>,
not through any one form actuating
it, but <em>by the exclusion of all forms</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
And again: “The accidental form
supervenes to a subject already pre-existent
in act; the substantial form,
on the contrary, does not supervene
to a subject already pre-existent
in act, but <em>to something which is
merely in potency to exist</em>, viz., <em>to the
first matter</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> And again: “The
true nature of matter is <em>to have no
form whatever in act</em>, but to be in
potency with regard to any of
them.”<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> And again: “The first
matter is a pure potency, just as
God is a pure act.”<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>From these passages, and from
many others that might be found
in S. Thomas’ works, it is manifest
that the holy doctor, in his metaphysical
speculations, considers the
first matter as matter without a
form. In this he faithfully follows
Aristotle’s doctrine. For the Greek
philosopher explicitly teaches that
“as the metal is to the statue, or
the wood to the bedstead, or any
other unformed material to the
thing which can be formed with it,
so is the matter to the substance
and to the being”;<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> that is, as
the metal has not yet the form of a
statue, so the first matter still lacks
the substantial form, and consequently
is a <em>pure</em> potency of being.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Angelic Doctor
does not always abide by this old
and genuine notion of the first matter.
When treating of generation
and corruption, or engaged in other
physical questions, he freely assumes
that the first matter is something
actually lying under a substantial
form, and therefore that it
is a <em>real</em> potency in the order of
nature, and not a mere result of
intellectual abstraction. Thus he
concedes that “the first matter
exists in all bodies,”<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> that “the
first matter must have been created
by God under a substantial form,”<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
and that “the first matter remains
in act, after it has lost a certain
form, owing to the fact that it is
actuated by another form.”<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> In
these passages and in many others
the first matter is evidently considered
as matter under a form.</p>

<p>It is difficult to reconcile with
one another these two notions, matter
<em>without a form</em>, and matter <em>under
a form</em>; for they seem quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
contradictory. The only manner
of attempting such a conciliation
would be to assume that when the
first matter is said to be without a
form, the preposition “without” is
intended to express a mental abstraction,
not a real exclusion, of
the substantial form. Thus the
phrase “without a form” would
mean “without taking the form into
account,” although such a form is
really in the matter. This interpretation
of the phrase might be justified
by those passages of the holy
doctor in which the first matter, inasmuch
as <em>first</em>, is presented as a
result of intellectual abstraction.
Here is one of such passages: “First
matter,” says he, “is commonly
called something, within the genus
of substance which is <em>conceived</em> as a
potency abstracted from all forms
and from all privations, but susceptible
both of forms and of privations.”<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
It is evident that, by this
kind of abstraction, the matter which
is actually under a form would be
conceived as being without a form.
As, however, the conception would
not correspond to the reality, the
first matter, thus conceived, would
have nothing common with the real
matter which exists in nature. For,
since the whole reality of matter
depends on its actuation by a form,
to conceive the matter without any
form is to take away from it the
only source of its reality, and to
leave nothing but a non-entity connoting
the privation of its form.
Hence such a <i lang="la">materia prima</i> would
entirely belong to the order of conceptual
beings, not to the order of
realities; and therefore the matter
which exists in nature would not be
“first matter.” It is superfluous to
remark that if the first matter does
not exist, as <em>first</em>, in the real order,
all the reasonings of the peripatetic
school about the offices performed
by the first matter in the substantial
generation are at an end.</p>

<p>The confusion of actuated with
actuable matter was quite unavoidable
in the Aristotelic theory of
substantial generations. This theory
assumes that not only the primitive
elements of matter, but also
every compound material substance,
has a special <em>substantial</em> form giving
the <em>first</em> being (<i lang="la">simpliciter esse</i>, or
<i lang="la">primum esse</i>) to its matter. Hence,
in the substantial generation, as
understood by Aristotle, the matter
must pass from one <em>first</em> being to
another <em>first</em> being. Now, the authors
who adopted such a theory
well saw that the matter which had
to acquire a first being, was to be
considered as having no being at
all; else it would not acquire its
<em>first</em> being. On the other hand,
the matter which passed from one
first being to another was to be
considered as having a first being;
or else it would not exchange it
for another. Hence the first matter,
as ready to acquire a first being,
was called a <em>pure</em> potency&mdash;that
is, a potency of being; whilst, as
ready to exchange its first being for
another, it was called a <em>real</em> potency&mdash;that
is, an actual reality. That a
<em>pure</em> potency can be a <em>real</em> potency,
or an actual reality, is an assumption
which the peripatetic school
never succeeded in proving, though
it is the very foundation of the
theory of strictly substantial generations
as by them advocated.</p>

<p>Before we proceed further we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
have to mention S. Augustine’s notion
of <em>unformed</em> matter, as one
which contains a great deal more
of truth than is commonly believed
by the peripatetic writers. This
great doctor admits that <em>unformed</em>
matter was created, and existed for
a time in its informity. “The
earth,” says he, “was nothing but
unformed matter; for it was invisible
and uncompounded, … and
out of this invisible and uncompounded
matter, out of this informity,
out of this almost mere nothingness,
thou wast to make, O
God! all the things which this
changeable world contains.”<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Some
will ask: How could such a great
man admit the existence of matter
without a form? Did he not know
that a potency without an act cannot
exist? Or is it to be suspected
that what he calls <em>unformed matter</em>
was not altogether destitute of a
form, but only of such a form as
would make it visible as in the
compound bodies?</p>

<p>S. Thomas believes that S. Augustine
really excluded all forms from
his unformed matter, and remarks
that such an unformed matter could
not possibly exist in such a state;
for, if it existed, it was in act as a
result of creation. For the term
of creation is a being in act; and
the act is a form.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Thus it is evident
that to admit the existence of
the matter without any form at all
is a very gross blunder. But, for
this very reason that the blunder is
so great, we cannot believe that S.
Augustine made himself guilty of
it. We rather believe that he merely
excluded from his unformed matter
a visible shape, and what was
afterward called “the form of corporeity”
by which compound substances
are constituted in their species
and distinguished from one
another. Let us hear him.</p>

<p>“There was a time,” says he,
“when I used to call <em>unformed</em>, not
that which I thought to be altogether
destitute of a form, but that
which I imagined to be ill-formed,
and to have such an odd and ugly
form as would be shocking to see.
But what I thus imagined was unformed,
not absolutely, but only in
comparison with other things endowed
with better forms; whilst
reason and truth demanded that I
should discard entirely all thought
of any remaining form, if I wished
to conceive matter as truly unformed.
But this I could not do; for
it was easier to surmise that a thing
altogether deprived of form had no
existence, than to admit anything
intermediate between a formed being
and nothing, which would be
neither a formed being nor nothing,
but an unformed being and almost
a mere nothing. At last I dropped
from my mind all those images of
formed bodies, which my imagination
was used to multiply and vary
at random, and began to consider
the bodies themselves, and their
mutability on account of which such
bodies cease to be what they were,
and begin to be what they were
not. And I began to conjecture
that their passage from one form
to another was made through something
unformed, not through absolute
nothing. But this I desired to
know, not to surmise. Now, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
I to say all that thou, O God! hadst
taught me about this subject, who
among my readers would strive to
grasp my thought? But I shall not
cease to praise thee in my heart for
those very things which I cannot
expound. For the mutability of
changeable things is susceptible of
all the forms by which such things
can be changed. But what is such
a mutability? Is it a soul? Is it a
body? Is it the feature of a soul
or of a body? Were it allowable,
I would call it a <em>nothing-something</em>,
and a <em>being non-being</em>. And yet it
was already in some manner before
it received these visible and compounded
forms.”<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The more we examine this passage,
the stronger becomes our conviction
that the word “form” was
used here by S. Augustine, not for
the substantial form of Aristotle,
but for <em>shape</em> or geometric form,
and that “unformed matter” stands
here for <em>shapeless matter</em>. For, when
he says that “reason and truth demand
that all thought of any
remaining forms should be discarded,”
of what remaining forms
does he speak? Of those “odd and
ugly forms” which he says would
be shocking to see. But it is evident
that no substantial form can
be odd and ugly or shocking to
see. Moreover, S. Augustine conceives
his “unformed matter,” by
dropping from his mind “all those
images of formed bodies” by which
his imagination had been previously
haunted. Now, it is obvious
that substantial forms are not an
object of the imagination, nor can
they be styled “images” of formed
bodies. Lastly, the holy doctor
explicitly says that the matter of
the bodies “was already in some
manner before it could receive <em>these
visible and compounded forms</em>,”
which shows that the forms which
he excluded from the primitive
matter are “the visible and compounded
forms” of bodies&mdash;that is,
such forms as result from material
composition. And this is confirmed
by those other words of the holy
doctor, “The earth was nothing
but unformed matter; <em>for it was
invisible and uncompounded</em>”&mdash;that is,
the informity of the earth consisted
in the absence of material composition,
and, therefore, of visible
shape, not in the absence of primitive
substantial forms.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know
why S. Augustine believed that his
readers would not bear with him
(<i lang="la">quis legentium capere durabit?</i>) if
he were to say all that God had
taught him about shapeless matter.
Had God taught him the existence
of simple and unextended elements?
Was his shapeless matter
that simple point, that invisible and
uncompounded potency, on account
of which all elements are
liable to geometrical arrangement
and to physical composition? The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
holy doctor does not tell us; but
certainly, if there ever was shapeless
matter, it could have no extension,
for extension entails shape. It
would, therefore, seem that S. Augustine’s
shapeless matter could
not but consist of simple and unextended
elements; and if so, he had
good reason to expect that his readers
would scorn a notion so contrary
to the popular bias; as we
see that even in our own time, and
in the teeth of scientific and philosophical
evidence, the same notion
cannot take hold of the popular
mind.</p>

<p>If the unformed matter of S. Augustine
is matter without shape and
without extension, we can easily understand
why he calls it <i lang="la">pene nullam
rem</i>, viz., scarcely more than nothing.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
Indeed, the potential term
of a primitive element, a simple
point in space, is scarcely more
than nothing; for it has no bulk,
and were it not for the act which
gives it existence, it would be nothing
at all, as it has nothing in
itself and in its potential nature
which deserves the name of “being”;
but it borrows all its being
from the substantial act, as we
shall explain later on. It is, therefore,
plain that the matter of a simple
element, and of all simple elements,
is hardly more than nothing,
and that it might almost be described
as a <em>nothing-something</em>, and a
<em>being non-being</em>, as S. Augustine observes.
But when the primitive
matter began to cluster into bodies
having bulk and composition, then
this same matter acquired a <em>visible
form</em> under definite dimensions,
and thus one mass of matter became
distinguishable from another,
and by the arrangement of such
distinct material things the order
and beauty of the world were produced.</p>

<p>Thus S. Augustine did not admit
the existence of matter deprived of
a substantial form, but only the existence
of matter without shape, and
therefore without extension. And
for this reason we have said that
his doctrine contains more truth
than is commonly believed by the
peripatetic writers. His <em>uncompounded</em>
matter can mean nothing
else than simple elements; and
since the components are the material
cause of the compound, and
must be presupposed to it, the
simple elements of which all bodies
consist are undoubtedly those
material beings which God must
have created before anything having
shape and material composition
could make its appearance in the
world. Hence S. Augustine’s view
of creation is, in this respect, perfectly
consistent with sound philosophy
no less than with revelation.
His shapeless matter must be ranked,
we think, with the first matter
of Suarez above mentioned, under
the name of <em>primitive</em> material substance.</p>

<p>As to the first matter of S. Thomas
and of the other followers of
Aristotle, it is difficult to say what
it is; for we have seen that it has
been understood in two different
manners. If we adopt its most received
definition, we must call it
“a pure potency” and “a first potency.”
According to this definition,
the first matter is a non-entity,
as we have already remarked, and
has no part in the constitution of
substance, any more than a corpse
in the constitution of man; for, as
the body of man is not <em>a living
corpse</em>, so the matter in material
substance is not <em>a pure potency in act</em>,
both expressions implying a like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
contradiction. Hence the first
matter, according to this definition,
is not a metaphysical being, but a
mere being of reason&mdash;that is, a conception
of nothingness as resulting
from the suppression of the formal
principle of being.</p>

<p>From our notion of simple elements
we can form a very clear image
of this being of reason. In a
primitive element the matter borrows
all its reality from the substantial
form of which it is the intrinsic
term&mdash;that is, from a virtual sphericity
of which it is the centre. To
change such a centre into a <em>pure</em>
potency of being, we have merely
to suppress the virtual sphericity;
for, by so doing, what was a <em>real</em>
centre of power becomes an <em>imaginary</em>
centre, a term deprived of its
reality, a mere nothing; which
however, from the nature of the
process by which it is reached, is
still conceived as the vestige of the
real centre of power, and, so to say,
the shadow of the real matter which
disappears. Thus the <i lang="la">materia prima</i>,
as a pure potency, is nothing else
than an imaginary point in space,
or the potency of a real centre of
power. This clear and definite
conception of the first matter is calculated
to shed some additional
light on many questions connected
with the peripatetic philosophy,
and, above all, on the very definition
of matter. The old metaphysicians,
when defining the first matter to be
“a pure potency,” had no notion
of the existence of simple elements,
and knew very little about the law
of material actions; and for this
reason they could say nothing
about the special character of such
a pure potency. For the same reason
they were unable also to point
out the special nature of the first act
of matter; they simply recognized
that the conspiration of such a potency
with such an act ought to
give rise to a “movable being.”
But potency and act are to be found
not only in material, but also in
spiritual, substances; and as these
substances are of a quite different
nature, it is evident that their respective
potencies and their respective
acts must be of a quite different
nature. Now, the special character
of the potency of material
substance consists in its being a <em>local</em>
term, whilst the special character
of the potency of spiritual substance
consists in its being an <em>intellectual</em>
term. And therefore, to distinguish
the former from the latter,
we should say that the matter is “a
potential term <em>in space</em>” and the
first matter “a potency of being
in space.” The additional words
“<em>in space</em>” point out the characteristic
attribute of the material
potency as distinguished from all
other potencies.</p>

<p>Moreover, our conception of
<i lang="la">materia prima</i> as an imaginary point
in space may help us to realize
more completely the distinction
which must be made between the
non-entity of the first matter and
absolute nothingness. Absolute nothingness
is a mere negation of
being, or a <em>negative</em> non-entity;
whereas the non-entity of the first
matter is formally constituted by a
privation, and must be styled a
<em>privative</em> non-entity. For, as the
matter and its substantial form are
the constituents of one and the
same primitive essence, we cannot
think of the matter without reference
to the form, nor of the form
without reference to the matter.
And therefore, when, in order to
conceive the first matter, we suppress
mentally the substantial form,
we deprive the matter of what it
essentially requires for its existence;
and it is in consequence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
such a process that we reduce the
matter to a non-entity. Now, to
exclude from the matter the form
which is due to it is to constitute
the matter under a privation.
Therefore the resulting non-entity
of the first matter is a privative
non-entity. Indeed, privation is
defined as “the absence of something
due <em>to a subject</em>,” and we can
scarcely say that a non-entity is a
subject. But this definition applies
to <em>real</em> privations only, which require
a <em>real</em> subject lacking something
due to it; as when a man has
lost an eye or a foot. But in our
case, as we are concerned with a
pure potency of being, which has
no reality at all, our subject can
be nothing else than a non-entity.
This is the subject which demands
the form of which it is bereaved, as
it cannot even be conceived without
reference to it. The very name
of <em>matter</em>, which it retains, points
out a <em>form</em> as its transcendental
correlative; while the epithet
“first” points out the fact that this
matter is yet destitute of that being
which it should have in order to
deserve the name of <em>real</em> matter.</p>

<p>But, much as this notion of the
first matter agrees with that of
“pure potency” and of “first potency,”
the followers of the peripatetic
system will say that <em>their</em>
first matter is something quite different,
as is evident from their
theory of substantial generations,
which would have no meaning, if
the first matter were not a reality.
Let us, then, waive for the present
the notion of “<em>pure</em> potency,” and
turn our attention to that of “<em>real</em>
potency,” that we may see what
kind of reality the first matter must
be, when the “first matter” is identified
with the matter actually existing
under a substantial form.</p>

<p>The matter actuated by a form
is a <em>real potency</em>, and nothing more.
It is only by stretching the word
“being” beyond its legitimate
meaning that this real potency is
sometimes called a real being. In
fact, the potential term of the real
being is real, not on account of any
real entity involved in its own nature,
but merely on account of the
real act by which it is actuated.
How anything can be real without
possessing an entity of its own our
reader may easily understand by
recollecting what we have often remarked
about the centre of a sphere,
whose reality is entirely due to the
spherical form, or by reflecting that
negations and privations are similarly
called <em>real</em>, not because of any
entity involved in them, but simply
because they are appurtenances of
real beings.</p>

<p>We have seen that S. Augustine
would fain have called the primitive
matter a <em>nothing-something</em> and
a <em>being non-being</em>, if such phrases
had been allowable. His thought
was deep, but he could not find
words to express it thoroughly.
Our “real potency” is that “nothing-something”
which was in the
mind of the holy doctor. S. Thomas
gives us a clew to the explanation
of such a “nothing-something”
by remarking that <em>to be</em> and <em>to have
being</em> are not precisely the same
thing. <em>To be</em> is the attribute of a
complete act, whilst <em>to have being</em> is
the attribute of a potency actuated
by its act. That is said <em>to be</em>
which contains in itself the formal
reason of its being; whilst that is
said <em>to have being</em> which does not
contain in itself the formal reason
of its being, but receives its being
from without, and puts it on as
a borrowed garment. Of course,
God alone can be said <em>to be</em> in the
fullest meaning of the term, as he
alone contains in himself the <em>adequate</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
reason of his being; yet all
created essence can be said <em>to be</em>,
inasmuch as it contains in itself the
<em>formal</em> reason of its being&mdash;that is,
an act giving existence to a potency;
whereas the potency itself can
be said merely <em>to have being</em>, because
<em>being</em> is not included in the nature
of potency, but must come to it
from a distinct source. And therefore,
as a thing colored <em>has</em> color,
but <em>is not</em> color, and as a body animated
<em>has</em> life, but <em>is not</em> life, so the
matter actuated by its form <em>has</em> being,
but <em>is not</em> a being.</p>

<p>Some philosophers, who failed to
take notice of this distinction, maintained
that the matter which exists
under a substantial form is an <em>incomplete
being</em>, and an <em>incomplete substance</em>.
The expression is not correct.
For, if the matter which lies
under the substantial form were an
incomplete being, it would be the
office of the form to complete it.
Now, the substantial form can have
no such office; for the form always
inchoates what the matter completes.
It is always the term that
completes the act, whilst the act
actuates the term by giving it the
first being. Hence the matter
which lies under its substantial form
is not an incomplete entity. Nor
is it an entity destined to complete
the form; for, if the term which
completes a form were a being, such
a term would be a real subject, and
thus the form terminated to it would
not be strictly substantial, as it
would not give it the first being.
Moreover, the matter and the substantial
form constitute <em>one</em> primitive
essence, in which it is impossible
to admit a multiplicity of entitative
constituents; and therefore,
since the substantial form, which is
a formal source of being, is evidently
an entitative constituent, it follows
that the matter lying under it
has no entity of its own, but is
merely clothed with the entity of
its form.</p>

<p>But, true though it is that the
matter lying under a substantial
form has no entity of its own, it is,
however, a <em>real</em> term, as we have already
intimated; hence it may be
called a <em>reality</em>. And since <em>reality</em>
and <em>entity</em> are commonly used as
synonymous, we may admit that the
formed matter is an entity, adjectively,
not substantively, just as we
admit that ivory is <em>a sphere</em> when it
lies under a spherical form. Nevertheless
the ivory, to speak more
properly, should be said <em>to have
sphericity</em> rather than <em>to be a sphere</em>;
for, though it is the subject of
sphericity, it is not spherical of its
own nature. In the same manner,
a body vivified by a soul is called
<em>living</em>; but, properly speaking, it
should be styled <em>having life</em>, because
life is not a property of the
body as such, but it springs from
the presence of the soul in the
body. The like is to be said of
the being of the matter as actuated
by the substantial form. It is from
the form alone that such a matter
has its first being; and therefore
such a matter has only a borrowed
being, and is a <em>real potency</em>, not a
real entity. Such is, we believe,
the true interpretation of S. Augustine’s
phrase: “nothing-something”
and “being non-being”&mdash;<i lang="la">Nihil
aliquid, et est non est</i>.</p>

<p>Nor is it strange that the matter
should be <em>a reality</em> without being
<em>an entity</em>, properly so called; for the
like happens with all the real terms
of contingent things. Thus the
real term of a line (the point) is no
linear entity, though it certainly
belongs to the line, and is something
real in the line; the real
term of time (the present instant,
or the <em>now</em>) is no temporal entity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
as it has no extension, though it
certainly belongs to time, and is
something real in time; the real
term of a body (the simple element)
is no bodily entity, as it has
no bulk, though it certainly belongs
to the body, and is something real
in it; the real term of a circle (the
centre) is no circular entity, though
it certainly belongs to the circle,
and is something real in it. And
in like manner the real term of a
primitive contingent substance (its
potency) is no substantial entity,
though it evidently belongs to the
contingent substance, and is something
real in it. In God alone,
whose being excludes contingency,
the substantial term (the Word)
stands forth as a true entity&mdash;a
most perfect and infinite entity&mdash;for,
as the term of the divine generation
is not educed out of nothing,
it is absolutely free from all potentiality,
and is in eternal possession
of infinite actuality. Hence it is
that God alone, as we have above
remarked, can be said <em>to be</em> in the
fullest meaning of the term.</p>

<p>As the best authors agree that
the matter which is under a substantial
form is no being, but only
“a real potency,” we will dispense
with further considerations on this
special point. What we have said
suffices to give our readers an idea
of the <i lang="la">materia prima</i> of the ancients,
and of the different manners in
which it has been understood.</p>

<p><em>Substantial form.</em>&mdash;Coming now
to the notion of the substantial
form the first thing which deserves
special notice is the fact that the
phrase “substantial form” can be
interpreted in two manners, owing
to the double meaning attached to
the epithet “substantial.” All the
forms which supervene to a specific
nature already constituted have
been called “accidental,” and all
the forms which enter into the constitution
of a specific nature have
been called “substantial.” But as
the accident can be contrasted
with the <em>essence</em> no less than with
the <em>substance</em> of a thing, so the
substantial form can be defined
either as that which gives the first
being to a certain <em>essence</em>, or as that
which gives the first being to a <em>substance</em>
as such. The schoolmen, in
fact, left us two definitions of their
substantial forms, of which the
first is: “The substantial form is
that which gives the first being to
the matter”; the second is: “The
substantial form is that which
gives the first being to a thing.”
The first definition belongs to the
form strictly substantial, for the result
of the first actuation of matter
is a primitive substance; whereas
the second has a much wider range,
because all things which involve
material composition, in their specific
nature, receive the first specific
being by a form which needs not
give the first existence to their material
components, and which, therefore,
is not strictly a substantial
form. Thus a molecule of oxygen,
because it contains a definite number
of primitive elements, cannot
be formally constituted in its specific
nature, except by a specific
composition; and such a composition
is an essential, though not a truly
substantial, form of the compound,
as we shall more fully explain
in another article.</p>

<p>The strictly substantial form contains
in itself the whole reason of
the being of the substance; for the
matter which completes it does not
contribute to the constitution of the
substance, except as a mere term&mdash;that
is, by simply receiving existence,
and therefore without adding
any new entity to the entity of the
form. Whence it follows that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
form itself contains the whole reason
of the resulting essence. “Although
the essence of a being,” says
S. Thomas, “is neither the form
alone nor the matter alone, yet the
form alone is, in its own manner,
the cause of such an essence.”<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> It
cannot, however, be inferred from
this that the strictly substantial
form is a <em>physical</em> being. Physical
beings have a complete essence and
an existence of their own; which is
not the case with any material
form. “Even the forms themselves,”
according to S. Thomas,
“have no being; it is only the compounds
(of matter and form) that
have being through them.”<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> And
again: “The substantial form itself
has no complete essence; for in the
definition of the substantial form it
is necessary to include that of
which it is the form.”<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> It is plain
that a being which has no complete
essence and no possibility of a
separate existence cannot be styled
a physical being, but only a
metaphysical constituent of the
physical being.</p>

<p>The schoolmen teach that the
substantial forms of bodies <em>are
educed out of the potency of matter</em>.
This proposition is true. For the
so-called “substantial” forms of
bodies are not strictly substantial,
but only essential or natural forms,
as they give the first existence, not
to the matter of which the bodies
are composed, but only to the
bodies themselves. Now, all bodies
are material compounds of a certain
species, and therefore involve distinct
material terms bound together
by a specific form of composition,
without which such a specific compound
can have no existence. The
specific form of composition is
therefore the essential form of a
body of a given species; and such
is the form that gives <em>the first being</em>
to the body. To say that such a
form is educed out of the potency
of matter is to state an obvious
truth, as it is known that the composition
of bodies is brought about
by the mutual action of the elements
of which the bodies are constituted,
which action proceeds
from the <em>active</em> potency, and actuates
the <em>passive</em> potency of the matter
of the body, as we shall explain
more fully in the sequel.</p>

<p>But the old natural philosophers,
who had no notion of primitive unextended
elements, when affirming
the eduction of substantial forms
out of the potency of matter, took
for granted that such forms were
strictly substantial, and gave the
first being not only to the body,
but also to the matter itself of
which the body was composed. In
this they were mistaken; but the
mistake was excusable, as chemistry
had not yet shown the law of definite
proportions in the combination
of different bodies, nor had the
spectroscope revealed the fact that
the primitive molecules of all bodies
are composed of free elementary
substances vibrating around a common
centre, and remaining substantially
identical amid all the changes
produced by natural causes in the
material world. Nevertheless, had
they not been biassed by the <i lang="la">Ipse
dixit</i>, the peripatetics would have
found that, though accidental
forms, and many essential forms
too, are educed out of the potency
of matter, yet the strictly substantial
forms cannot be so educed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>The matter may be conceived
either as formed or as unformed. If
it is formed, it is already in possession
of its substantial form and of
its first being, which it never loses,
as we shall prove hereafter. Therefore
such a matter is not in potency
with regard to its first being; and
thus no strictly substantial form
can be educed from the potency of
the formed matter. If, on the contrary,
the matter is yet unformed, it
is plain that such a matter cannot
be acted on by natural agents; for
it has no existence in the order of
things, and therefore it cannot be
the subject of natural actions. How,
then, can it receive the first being?
Owing to the impossibility of explaining
how the unformed matter
could be actuated by natural agents,
those who admitted the eduction
of substantial forms out of the potency
of matter were constrained
to assume that the <em>first</em> matter had
some reality of its own, and consisted
intrinsically, as Suarez teaches,
of act and potency. But, though
it is true that the matter must have
some reality in order to receive
from natural agents a new form, it
is evident that such a new form
cannot be strictly substantial; for
it cannot give the first being to a
matter already endowed with being.
Hence no strictly substantial form
can be naturally educed out of the
potency of matter.</p>

<p>If, then, a truly substantial form
could in any sense be educed out
of the potency of matter, such an
eduction should be made, not by
natural causes, but by God himself
in the act of creation; for no agent,
except God, can bring matter into
existence. But we think that even
in this case it would be incorrect
to say that the substantial form
is educed out of the potency of
matter. For, although the unformed
matter, and the nothingness
out of which things are educed
by creation, admit of no real difference,
yet the unformed matter, as a
privative non-entity, involves a formality
of reason, which absolute nothingness
does not involve; and
hence to substitute the unformed
matter for absolute nothingness as
the extrinsic term of creation, is to
present the fact of creation under a
false formality. God creates a substance,
not by educing its <em>form</em> out
of a privative non-entity&mdash;that is,
out of an abstraction&mdash;but by educing
the <em>substance</em> itself out of nothingness.
And for this reason it
would be quite incorrect to call
creation an eduction of a substantial
form out of the potency of
matter.</p>

<p>There is yet another reason why
creation should not be so explained.
For the philosophers who admit
the eduction of substantial
forms out of the potency of matter,
assume, either explicitly or implicitly,
that such a potency is <em>real</em>,
though they often call it “a pure
potency,” as we have stated. Their
matter is therefore a <em>real</em> subject of
substantial generations. Now, it is
obvious that creation neither presupposes
nor admits a previous real
subject. Hence, to say that creation
is the eduction of a substantial
form out of the potency of matter,
would be to employ a very mischievous
phrase, with nothing to justify
it, even if no other objection could
be raised against its use.</p>

<p>We conclude that strictly substantial
forms are never educed out
of the potency of matter, but are
simply educed out of nothing in
creation. As, however, every such
form gives being to its matter, without
which it cannot exist, we commonly
say that the whole substance,
and not its form as such, is educed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
out of nothing. S. Thomas says:
“The term of creation is a being
in act; and its act is its form”<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>&mdash;the
form, evidently, which gives the
first being to the matter, and which
is therefore truly and properly substantial.
Hence, before the position
of this act, nothing exists in
nature which can be styled “matter,”
whilst at the position of this
act, and by virtue of it, the material
substance itself is instantly
brought into existence. Accordingly,
the position of an act which
formally gives existence to its term
is the very eduction of the substance
out of nothing; and the
strictly substantial form is educed
out of nothing in the very creation
of the substance, whereas the matter,
at the mere position of such a
form, and through it immediately,
acquires its first existence. The
matter, as the reader may recollect,
is to its form what the centre of a
sphere is to the spherical form.
Hence, as the centre acquires its
being by the mere position of a
spherical form, so the matter acquires
its being by the mere position
of the substantial form, without
the concurrence of any other
causality.</p>

<p>This last conclusion may give
rise to an objection, which we cannot
leave without an answer. The
objection is the following: If the
matter receives its first being
through the substantial form alone,
it follows that God did not create
the matter, but only the form itself.</p>

<p>We answer that when we speak
of the creation of matter, the word
“matter” means “material substance.”
For the term of creation,
as we have just remarked with S.
Thomas, is <em>the being in act</em>&mdash;that is,
the complete being, as it physically
exists in the order of nature. Now,
such a being is the substance itself.
On the other hand, to create <em>the
being in act</em> is to produce <em>the act</em>
which is the formal reason of the
being; and since the position of the
act entails the existence of a potential
term, it is evident that God,
by producing the act, causes the
existence of the potential term.
But as this term is not a “real being,”
but only a “real potency,”
and as its reality is merely “borrowed”
from the substantial form,
it has nothing in itself which requires
making, and therefore it cannot
be the term of a special creation.</p>

<p>The old philosophers, who admitted
the separability of the matter
from its substantial form, and
who were for this reason obliged to
grant to such a matter an imperfect
being, were wont to say that
the matter was <em>con-created</em> with the
form, and thus they seem to have
conceived the creation of a primitive
material substance as including
two partial creations. But, as a
primitive being includes but <em>one</em> act,
it cannot be the term of <em>two</em> actions;
for two actions imply two
acts. On the other hand, the matter
which is under the substantial
act has no entity of its own, as we
have shown to be the true and
common doctrine, and therefore
has no need of a special effection,
but only of a formal actuation.
Hence the creation of a primitive
material substance does not consist
of two partial creations. We
may, however, adopt the term “<em>con-created</em>”
to express the fact that
the position of the act entails the
reality of the potential term, just
as the position of sphericity entails
the existence of a centre.</p>

<p>The preceding remarks have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
been made with the object of preparing
the solution of a difficulty
concerning the creation of matter.
For matter is potential, whilst God
is a pure act without potency; but
a pure act without potency cannot
produce anything potential, since it
does not contain in itself any potentiality
nor anything equivalent to it.
Therefore the origin of matter cannot
be accounted for by creation.</p>

<p>The answer to this difficulty is
as follows: We grant that the matter,
as distinguished from the form
which gives it the first being, and
therefore as a potential term of the
primitive substance, cannot be created,
for it is no being at all, but
only a potency of being; and yet
it does not follow that the material
substance itself cannot be created.
Of course God does not contain in
himself, either formally or eminently,
the potentiality of his own creatures,
but he eminently contains in
himself and can produce out of
himself an endless multitude of acts
giving existence to as many potential
terms. And thus God, by producing
any such act, causes the existence
of its correspondent potency,
which is not efficiently made,
but only formally actuated, as has
been just explained. Creation is an
action, and action is the production
of an act; hence “the term of creation
is <em>a being in act</em>, and this act is
the form,” as St. Thomas teaches;
the matter, on the contrary, or the
potency of the created being, is a
term coming out of nothingness by
formal actuation, and consequently
having no being of its own, but
owing whatever existence it has to
the act or form of which it is the
term; so that, if God ceased to
conserve such an act, the term
would instantly vanish altogether
without need of a special annihilation.
Nothingness is the source of
all potentiality and imperfection, as
God is the source of all actuality
and perfection. Hence even the
spiritual creatures, in which there
is no matter, are essentially potential,
inasmuch as they, too, have
come out of nothing. This suffices
to show that God, though containing
in himself no formal and no
virtual potentiality, can create a
substance essentially constituted of
act and potency. For we have
seen that, to create such a substance,
God needs only to produce an act
<em>ad extra</em>, and that such an act contains
in itself the formal reason of
its proportionate potency; because
“although the essence of a being is
neither the form alone nor the
matter alone, yet the form alone is
in its own manner (that is, by formal
principiation) the cause of such
an essence.”</p>

<p>And let this suffice respecting the
general notions of first matter and
substantial form.</p>

<h3>THE LEADER OF THE CENTRUM IN THE GERMAN REICHSTAG.</h3>

<p>The Catholics of Germany have
suffered a great loss in the death
of Herman von Mallinkrodt, deputy
to the Reichstag. Germany
now realizes what he was, and it is
indeed a pleasure for us to honor in
this periodical the memory of this
extraordinary man by giving a short
sketch of his life.</p>

<p>Herman von Mallinkrodt was
born in Minden (Westphalia), on
the 5th of February, 1821. His
father, who was of noble birth and
a Prussian officer of state, was a
Protestant; his mother, <i lang="fr">née</i> Von
Hartman, of Paderborn, was an excellent
Catholic. All the children
of this marriage were baptized Catholics&mdash;which
is very seldom the
case in mixed marriages&mdash;and were
filled with the true Catholic spirit.</p>

<p>Like Herman, so also did his
brother and sister, who were older
than he, distinguish themselves by
their decidedly Catholic qualities.
George, who had become the
possessor of the old convent of
Boeddekken, founded in the year
837 by S. Meinulph, cherished a
special devotion towards this the
first saint of Paderborn, and rebuilt
the chapel, destroyed in the beginning
of this century by the Prussian
government. This chapel is greatly
esteemed as a perfect specimen
of Gothic architecture, and is now
held in high honor, as being the
final resting-place of Herman von
Mallinkrodt. His sister, Pauline,
the foundress and mother-general
of the sisterhood of “Christian
Love,” has become celebrated by
the success she has achieved in the
education of girls. (The principal
teacher of Pauline was the noble
convert and celebrated poetess,
Louisa Aloysia Hensel, in whose
verses, according to the criticism
of the Protestant historian Barthel,
more tender and Christian sentiments
are expressed than are to be
found in any German production of
modern times.) These excellent
Sisters were also expelled, as being
dangerous to the state, and sought
as well as found a new field of usefulness
in America, the land of
freedom.</p>

<p>The true Catholic discipline of
these three children they owe to the
careful training of their mother and
the pure Catholic atmosphere of Aix-la-Chapelle,
to which city their father
was sent as vice-president of the
government. Herman followed the
profession of his father, and studied
jurisprudence. The interest felt by
the young jurist in whatever concerned
the church is seen in the
following incident, which had an important
influence on his whole life:
When the time had arrived for him
to pass his state examination, he retired
to the quiet of Boeddekken.
From different themes he selected
the one treating on the judicial relations
between church and state. Not
being satisfied with the view taken
by certain authors, he endeavored to
arrive at a knowledge of the matter
by personal investigation, and after
fourteen months of close application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
he succeeded in establishing a
system which proved itself on all
sides tenable and in harmony with
the writings of the old canonists of
the church. The person to whose
judgment the production was submitted
declared that the treatise,
although excellent, was too strongly
in favor of the church, but that
the author had permission to publish
it, which, however, was not
done. Herman, nevertheless, as he
afterwards told one of his friends,
had never to retract one of the principles
he then maintained; he had
only to let them develop themselves
more fully. As he in his youth did
not rest until he had become perfect
master of any theme he had to discuss,
so also did he never in afterlife
ascend the tribune, upon which
he won imperishable honors, until
he had digested the whole matter
in his mind. We make no mention
of the positions which Mallinkrodt
occupied as the servant of the
state. It is well known that his
strong Catholic sentiments were
for the Prussian government an
insurmountable objection to his
being elevated to a post corresponding
with his eminent ability,
until he, as counsellor of the government
at Merseburg, left the ungrateful
service of the state. It was,
however, his good fortune to apply
the talents which Almighty God
had given him in so full a measure,
to his parliamentary duties for eighteen
years, from 1852 to 1874, the
short interruption from 1864 to 1868
excepted.</p>

<p>In his life his friends recognized
his merits, and in his death even
his enemies confessed that a great
man had passed away.</p>

<p>This prominent leader Almighty
God has taken from us in a sudden
and unexpected manner. The last
Prussian Diet, at whose session he
was more conspicuous than ever before,
had adjourned, and in paying
his farewell visits before his return
to his home in Nord-Borchen,
where he possessed a family mansion,
he contracted a cold, which
finally developed itself into an inflammation
of the lungs and of the
membrane covering the thorax. On
the fifth day of his sickness the man
who, by his indefatigable public
labors and the grief he felt for the
afflictions undergone by the church,
had worn out his life, passed to his
eternal reward, on the 26th of May,
in the 53d year of his age. He had
married Thecla, <i lang="fr">née</i> Von Bernhard,
a step-sister of his first wife, several
months before his death, and she
was present when he died. Placing
one hand in hers, he embraced with
the other the cross, which in life he
had always venerated and chosen
as his standard.</p>

<p>No pen can describe the heartfelt
anguish which the Catholic
people of Germany felt at their loss.
At the funeral services in Berlin
the distinguished members of all
parties were present. The government
alone failed to acknowledge
the merit of one who had so long
been an eminent leader in the
Reichstag. Paderborn, to which
city the body was conveyed, has
never witnessed such a grand funeral
procession as that of Von Mallinkrodt.
From thence to Boeddekken,
a distance of nine miles, one
congregation after the other formed
the honorary escort, not counting
the crowd of mourners who had
gathered together at Boeddekken,
where the deceased was to be
buried in the chapel of S. Meinulph.
A large number of members
of the Centrum party, nearly all
the nobility of Westphalia, were
here assembled, and many cities of
Germany sent deputies, who deposited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
laurel wreaths upon the
coffin. It was an imposing sight
when his Excellency Dr. Windthorst
approached the open grave
to strew, as the last service of love,
some blessed earth upon the remains
of his dear friend, the tears
streaming meanwhile from his eyes.
During the funeral services the
bells of the Cathedral of Münster
tolled solemnly for two hours, summoning
Catholics from the different
districts to attend the High Mass
of Requiem for the beloved dead;
so that the words of the Holy
Scriptures applied to the hero of
the Machabees can be truly applied
also to Von Mallinkrodt: “And
all the people … bewailed him
with great lamentation” (1 Machabees
ix. 20). It is a remarkable fact
that even his opponents, who during
his lifetime attacked him with
all manner of weapons, could not
but bestow the most unqualified
praises upon him in death. It
would seem that the eloquence of
Von Mallinkrodt during his latter
years had been all in vain; for although
every seat was filled as soon
as he ascended the tribune to speak,
and he was listened to with profound
attention, yet he exercised no influence
upon the votes, for the reason
that they had previously been
determined upon. No one was
found who could reply to his forcible
arguments, for they were unanswerable.
Not only his graceful
oratory, but the very appearance
of a man so true to his convictions,
had its effect even upon his opponents.
It will not be out of place
for us to give a few of the tributes
paid to his memory by those who
differed from him in politics. Even
in Berlin, where titles are so plentiful,
the general sentiment was one
of sorrow. “With respectful sympathy,”
writes the <cite>Spener Gazette</cite>, “we
have to announce the unexpected
death of a man distinguished not
only for talent, but for integrity&mdash;Herman
von Mallinkrodt, deputy
to the Reichstag. He was sincerely
convinced of the justice of the cause
he espoused. Greater praise we cannot
bestow upon a friend, nor can
we refrain from acknowledging that
our late adversary always acted from
principle.” “Von Mallinkrodt,”
says the correspondent of the Berlin
<cite>Progress</cite>, “stood in the first
rank when there was question regarding
the policy of the government
against the church; no other
orator, not only of his own party,
but even of the opposition, could
compare with him in logical reasoning
or in rhetorical skill. His
speeches give evident proof of the
rare combination of truth and ability
to be found in this great man.”
The fault-finding Elberfelder <cite>Gazette</cite>
testifies as follows to the eloquence
of our deputy: “Who that
has listened to even one of Von
Mallinkrodt’s speeches can ever
forget the fascinating eloquence or
the picturesque appearance of the
orator&mdash;reminding one of the Duke
of Alba, by the perfect dignity of his
manner and the classic form of his
discourse?” The Magdeburg correspondent
almost goes further when
he says: “He served his party with
such disinterestedness, and was
so indifferent to his own advancement,
that it would be well if all
political parties could show many
such characters&mdash;men who live exclusively
for one idea, and sacrifice
every temporal advantage to
this idea. The Reichstag will find
it difficult to fill the vacuum caused
by the death of Von Mallinkrodt.
In this all parties agree; and
members who combated the principles
of the deceased with the
greatest earnestness, nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
confess that in energy and vigor
of expression he was seldom equalled
and never excelled by any one.”
“In regard to his exterior appearance,”
the Magdeburg <cite>Gazette</cite> says:
“Von Mallinkrodt, with his erect person,
beautifully-formed head, stern
features, and flashing eyes, was a
fine specimen of a man who knew
how to control his temper, and not
give way to an outburst of passion
at an important moment. He was
a leader who, in the severest combat,
could impart courage and confidence
to his followers, and he
stood as firm as a rock when any
attempt was made to crush him.…
He will not be soon forgotten
by those with whom he has had intellectual
contests. Of Von Mallinkrodt,
who stands alone among
men, it can be truly said: ‘He was
a great man.’”</p>

<p>The reader will pardon us for selecting
from among the many tributes
of respect paid to the memory
of Von Mallinkrodt one taken from
the democratic Frankfort <cite>Gazette</cite>,
edited by Jews, which journal at
other times keeps its columns open
to the most outrageous attacks upon
the Catholic Church. It says with
great truth: “The single idea of
the church entirely filled the mind
of this extraordinary and wonderful
man; and firmly as he upheld the
system of Mühler-Krätzig, as steadfastly
did he oppose the policy of
Falk. In this opposition he grew
stronger from session to session,
the governing principle of his life
developed itself more and more
fully, and he became bolder in his
attack upon the ministers and their
parliamentary friends. Talent and
character were united in him; a
true son of the church, he was at
the same time a true son of mother
earth, and his healthy organization
had its effect upon his disposition.
The last session of the Reichstag
saw him at the height of his usefulness;
his last grand speech, in reference
to the laws against the
bishops, was, as his friends and opponents
acknowledge, the most important
parliamentary achievement
since the beginning of the conflict.…
In him the Reichstag
loses not only one of its shining
lights, but also a character of iron
mould, such as is seldom found
preserved in all its strength in the
present unsettled state of public
affairs. We cannot join in the
requiem which the priests will sing
around his catafalque, but his honest
opponents will venerate his memory,
for he was, what can be said
of but few in our degenerate times&mdash;<em>a
true man</em>.”</p>

<p>With these noble qualities Von
Mallinkrodt possessed the greatest
modesty; he was accessible to
every one, cheerful and familiar in
the happy circle of his friends, respectful
to his political opponents,
just and reasonable to Protestants,
and devoted to his spiritual mother,
the Catholic Church. Like
O’Connell, during his parliamentary
labors he had constant recourse to
prayer. “Pray for me!” were his
farewell words to his sister when
he went to Berlin to enter the arena
of politics. When he had concluded
the above-mentioned last and
grand speech in the Reichstag, in
regard to the laws against the bishops,
with the words, <i lang="la">Per crucem
ad lucem</i>, which he himself translated,
“through the cross to joy,”
and when he descended the tribune,
he went directly to the seat of Rev.
Father Miller, of Berlin, counsellor
of the bishop, stretched out his
hand to him, and said, “You have
prayed well!” It is said of him
that before any important debate
in the chambers he went in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
morning to Holy Communion. The
people of Nord-Borchen tell one another
with emotion how, without ever
having been noticed by him, they
have observed their good Von Mallinkrodt
pass hours in prayer in the
lonely chapel near Borchen. What
pious aspirations he made in that
secluded spot God alone knows.
He was always very fond of reciting
the Rosary, which devotion displayed
itself particularly upon his
death-bed. He asked the Sister
who nursed him to recite the beads
with him, as his weakness prevented
him from praying aloud. When
his wife approached his couch of
pain, after greeting her affectionately,
he told her to look for his rosary
and crucifix, which she would find
lying beside him on the right. The
following day, when his sister, the
Superioress Pauline, had arrived in
Berlin, after a friendly salutation,
he said to her: “It is indeed good
that you are here; say with me another
decade of the Rosary.” It is
related of O’Connell that in a decisive
moment he would always retire
to a corner in the House of Parliament,
in order to say the Rosary;
it was also the habit of Von Mallinkrodt.</p>

<p>The same living faith which animated
him in life gave him also
consolation in death. “Think of
S. Elizabeth,” said he to his wife,
Thecla; “she also became a widow
when young.” When his wife, the
day previous to his death, spoke to
him of the love and grief of his five
children, tears filled his eyes; but he
wiped them quietly away without
uttering a word, and looked up to
heaven. He explained to the Sister
who attended him why during his
whole illness he had never felt any
solicitude concerning his temporal
or family affairs; for, said he, “I
have confidence in God.”</p>

<p>Another remarkable feature of
his last sickness, which testifies to
the peaceful state of mind of this
Christian warrior, who fought the
cause, but not the individual, was
the fact that he evinced real
satisfaction that his personal relations
toward his political opponents
had become no worse, but
even more friendly. It was this
sentiment which, when the fever
had reached its height, caused him
to exclaim: “I was willing to live
in peace with every one; but justice
must prevail! Should Christians
not speak more like Christians
when among Christians?”
As Von Mallinkrodt lived by faith,
so also did he die, embracing the
sign of redemption; and thus he
passed away <i lang="la">per crucem ad lucem</i>&mdash;through
the cross to joy.</p>

</div>

<h4>I. THE QUESTION STATED.</h4>

<p>The Catholic Church throughout
the world, beginning at Rome, is in
a suffering state. There is scarcely
a spot on the earth where she is
not assailed by injustice, oppression,
or violent persecution. Like her
divine Author in his Passion, every
member has its own trial of pain to
endure. All the gates of hell have
been opened, and every species of
attack, as by general conspiracy,
has been let loose at once upon the
church.</p>

<p>Countries in which Catholics outnumber
all other Christians put
together, as France, Austria, Italy,
Spain, Bavaria, Baden, South America,
Brazil, and, until recently, Belgium,
are for the most part controlled
and governed by hostile minorities,
and in some instances the
minority is very small.</p>

<p>Her adversaries, with the finger
of derision, point out these facts and
proclaim them to the world. Look,
they say, at Poland, Ireland, Portugal,
Spain, Bavaria, Austria, Italy,
France, and what do you see?
Countries subjugated, or enervated,
or agitated by the internal throes
of revolution. Everywhere among
Catholic nations weakness only and
incapacity are to be discerned.
This is the result of the priestly domination
and hierarchical influence
of Rome!</p>

<p>Heresy and schism, false philosophy,
false science, and false art,
cunning diplomacy, infidelity, and
atheism, one and all boldly raise
up their heads and attack the
church in the face; while secret
societies of world-wide organization
are stealthily engaged in undermining
her strength with the people.
Even the Sick man&mdash;the Turk&mdash;who
lives at the beck of the so-called
Christian nations, impudently kicks
the church of Christ, knowing full
well there is no longer in Europe
any power which will openly raise a
voice in her defence.</p>

<p>How many souls, on account of
this dreadful war waged against the
church, are now suffering in secret
a bitter agony! How many are
hesitating, knowing not what to do,
and looking for guidance! How
many are wavering between hope
and fear! Alas! too many have
already lost the faith.</p>

<p>Culpable is the silence and base
the fear which would restrain one’s
voice at a period when God, the
church, and religion are everywhere
either openly denied, boldly
attacked, or fiercely persecuted. In
such trying times as these silence or
fear is betrayal.</p>

<p>The hand of God is certainly in
these events, and it is no less certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
that the light of divine faith
ought to discern it. Through these
clouds which now obscure the
church the light of divine hope
ought to pierce, enabling us to perceive
a better and a brighter future;
for this is what is in store for the
church and the world. That love
which embraces at once the greatest
glory of God and the highest
happiness of man should outweigh
all fear of misinterpretations, and
urge one to make God’s hand clear
to those who are willing to see, and
point out to them the way to that
happier and fairer future.</p>

<p>What, then, has brought about this
most deplorable state of things?
How can we account for this apparent
lack of faith and strength on the
part of Catholics? Can it be true,
as their enemies assert, that Catholicity,
wherever it has full sway,
deteriorates society? Or is it contrary
to the spirit of Christianity
that Christians should strive with
all their might to overcome evil in
this world? Perhaps the Catholic
Church has grown old, as others
imagine, and has accomplished her
task, and is no longer competent to
unite together the conflicting interests
of modern society, and direct
it towards its true destination?</p>

<p>These questions are most serious
ones. Their answers must be
fraught with most weighty lessons.
Only a meagre outline of the course
of argument can be here given in so
vast a field of investigation.</p>

<h4>II. REMOTE CAUSE OF PRESENT DIFFICULTIES.</h4>

<p>One of the chief features of the
history of the church for these last
three centuries has been its conflict
with the religious revolution of
the XVIth century, properly called
Protestantism. The nature of
Protestantism may be defined as the
exaggerated development of personal
independence, directed to the
negation of the divine authority of
the church, and chiefly aiming at
its overthrow in the person of its
supreme representative, the Pope.</p>

<p>It is a fixed law, founded in the
very nature of the church, that
every serious and persistent denial
of a divinely-revealed truth necessitates
its vigorous defence, calls
out its greater development, and
ends, finally, in its dogmatic definition.</p>

<p>The history of the church is replete
with instances of this fact.
One must suffice. When Arius denied
the divinity of Christ, which
was always held as a divinely-revealed
truth, at once the doctors of
the church and the faithful were
aroused in its defence. A general
council was called at Nice, and
there this truth was defined and fixed
for ever as a dogma of the Catholic
faith. The law has always been,
from the first Council at Jerusalem
to that of the Vatican, that the negation
of a revealed truth calls out
its fuller development and its explicit
dogmatic definition.</p>

<p>The Council of Trent refuted and
condemned the errors of Protestantism
at the time of their birth, and
defined the truths against which
they were directed; but, for wise
and sufficient reasons, abstained
from touching the objective point of
attack, which was, necessarily, the
divine authority of the church. For
there was no standing-ground whatever
for a protest against the
church, except in its denial. It
would have been the height of absurdity
to admit an authority, and
that divine, and at the same time to
refuse to obey its decisions. It was
as well known then as to-day that
the keystone of the whole structure
of the church was its head. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
overthrow the Papacy was to conquer
the church.</p>

<p>The supreme power of the church
for a long period of years was the
centre around which the battle raged
between the adversaries and the
champions of the faith.</p>

<p>The denial of the Papal authority
in the church necessarily occasioned
its fuller development. For as
long as this hostile movement was
aggressive in its assaults, so long
was the church constrained to
strengthen her defence, and make
a stricter and more detailed application
of her authority in every
sphere of her action, in her hierarchy,
in her general discipline, and
in the personal acts of her children.
Every new denial was met with a
new defence and a fresh application.
The danger was on the side of revolt,
the safety was on that of submission.
The poison was an exaggerated
spiritual independence,
the antidote was increased obedience
to a divine external authority.</p>

<p>The chief occupation of the
church for the last three centuries
was the maintenance of that authority
conferred by Christ on S. Peter
and his successors, in opposition to
the efforts of Protestantism for its
overthrow; and the contest was
terminated for ever in the dogmatic
definition of Papal Infallibility, by
the church assembled in council in
the Vatican. Luther declared the
pope Antichrist. The Catholic
Church affirmed the pope to be the
Vicar of Christ. Luther stigmatized
the See of Rome as the seat of error.
The council of the church defined
the See of Rome, the chair of
S. Peter, to be the infallible interpreter
of divinely-revealed truth.
This definition closed the controversy.</p>

<p>In this pressing necessity of defending
the papal authority of the
church, the society of S. Ignatius
was born. It was no longer the refutation
of the errors of the Waldenses
and the Albigenses that was
required, nor were the dangers to
be combated such as arise from a
wealthy and luxurious society. The
former had been met and overcome
by the Dominicans; the latter by
the children of S. Francis. But
new and strange errors arose, and
alarming threats from an entirely
different quarter were heard. Fearful
blows were aimed and struck
against the keystone of the divine
constitution of the church, and millions
of her children were in open
revolt. In this great crisis, as in
previous ones, Providence supplied
new men and new weapons to meet
the new perils. S. Ignatius, filled
with faith and animated with heroic
zeal, came to the rescue, and formed
an army of men devoted to the
service of the church, and specially
suited to encounter its peculiar
dangers. The Papacy was their
point of attack; the members of
his society must be the champions
of the pope, his body-guard. The
papal authority was denied; the
children of S. Ignatius must make
a special vow of obedience to the
Holy Father. The prevailing sin
of the time was disobedience; the
members of his company must aim
at becoming the perfect models of
the virtue of obedience, men whose
will should never conflict with the
authority of the church, <i lang="la">perinde cadaver</i>.
The distinguishing traits of
a perfect Jesuit formed the antithesis
of a thorough Protestant.</p>

<p>The society founded by S. Ignatius
undertook a heavy and an
heroic task, one in its nature most
unpopular, and requiring above all
on the part of its members an entire
abnegation of that which men hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
dearest&mdash;their own will. It is no
wonder that their army of martyrs
is so numerous and their list of
saints so long.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the way of destroying
a vice is to enforce the practice
of its opposite virtue, and as the
confessional and spiritual direction
are appropriate channels for applying
the authority of the church to
the conscience and personal actions
of the faithful, the members
of this society insisted upon the
frequency of the one and the necessity
of the other. In a short
period of time the Jesuits were
considered the most skilful and
were the most-sought-after confessors
and spiritual directors in the
church.</p>

<p>They were mainly instrumental&mdash;by
the science of their theologians,
the logic of their controversialists,
the eloquence of their preachers,
the excellence of their spiritual
writers, and, above all, by the influence
of their personal example&mdash;in
saving millions from following in
the great revolt against the church,
in regaining millions who had gone
astray, and in putting a stop to the
numerical increase of Protestantism,
almost within the generation in
which it was born.</p>

<p>To their labors and influence it
is chiefly owing that the distinguishing
mark of a sincere Catholic
for the last three centuries has
been a special devotion to the Holy
See and a filial obedience to the
voice of the pope, the common father
of the faithful.</p>

<p>The logical outcome of the existence
of the society founded by S.
Ignatius of Loyola was the dogmatic
definition of Papal Infallibility;
for this was the final word of victory
of divine truth over the specific
error which the Jesuits were specially
called to combat.</p>

<h4>III. PROXIMATE CAUSE.</h4>

<p>The church, while resisting Protestantism,
had to give her principal
attention and apply her main
strength to those points which were
attacked. Like a wise strategist,
she drew off her forces from the
places which were secure, and
directed them to those posts where
danger threatened. As she was
most of all engaged in the defence
of her external authority and organization,
the faithful, in view of this
defence, as well as in regard to the
dangers of the period, were specially
guided to the practice of the virtue
of obedience. Is it a matter
of surprise that the character of
the virtues developed was more
passive than active? The weight
of authority was placed on the side
of restraining rather than of developing
personal independent action.</p>

<p>The exaggeration of personal
authority on the part of Protestants
brought about in the church its
greater restraint, in order that her
divine authority might have its
legitimate exercise and exert its
salutary influence. The errors and
evils of the times sprang from an
unbridled personal independence,
which could be only counteracted
by habits of increased personal dependence.
<i lang="la">Contraria contrariis curantur.</i>
The defence of the church
and the salvation of the soul were
ordinarily secured at the expense,
necessarily, of those virtues which
properly go to make up the strength
of Christian manhood.</p>

<p>The gain was the maintenance
and victory of divine truth and the
salvation of the soul. The loss
was a certain falling off in energy,
resulting in decreased action in the
natural order. The former was a
permanent and inestimable gain.
The latter was a temporary, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
not irreparable, loss. There was
no room for a choice. The faithful
were placed in a position in
which it became their unqualified
duty to put into practice the precept
of our Lord when he said:
<em>It is better for thee to enter into life
maimed or lame, than, having two
hands or two feet, to be cast into everlasting
fire</em>.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>In the principles above briefly
stated may in a great measure be
found the explanation why fifty
millions of Protestants have had
generally a controlling influence,
for a long period, over two hundred
millions of Catholics, in directing
the movements and destinies of
nations. To the same source may
be attributed the fact that Catholic
nations, when the need was felt of
a man of great personal energy at
the head of their affairs, seldom
hesitated to choose for prime minister
an indifferent Catholic, or a
Protestant, or even an infidel.
These principles explain also why
Austria, France, Bavaria, Spain,
Italy, and other Catholic countries
have yielded to a handful of active
and determined radicals, infidels,
Jews, or atheists, and have been
compelled to violate or annul their
concordats with the Holy See, and
to change their political institutions
in a direction hostile to the interests
of the Catholic religion. Finally,
herein lies the secret why Catholics
are at this moment almost everywhere
oppressed and persecuted
by very inferior numbers. In the
natural order the feebler are always
made to serve the stronger. Evident
weakness on one side, in spite
of superiority of numbers, provokes
on the other, where there is consciousness
of power, subjugation
and oppression.</p>

<h4>IV. IS THERE A WAY OUT?</h4>

<p>Is divine grace given only at the
cost of natural strength? Is a true
Christian life possible only through
the sacrifice of a successful natural
career? Are things to remain as
they are at present?</p>

<p>The general history of the Catholic
religion in the past condemns
these suppositions as the grossest
errors and falsest calumnies. Behold
the small numbers of the faithful
and their final triumph over the
great colossal Roman Empire! Look
at the subjugation of the countless
and victorious hordes of the Northern
barbarians! Witness, again, the
prowess of the knights of the
church, who were her champions in
repulsing the threatening Mussulman;
every one of whom, by the
rule of their order, were bound not
to flinch before two Turks! Call
to mind the great discoveries made
in all branches of science, and the
eminence in art, displayed by the
children of the church, and which
underlie&mdash;if there were only honesty
enough to acknowledge it&mdash;most of
our modern progress and civilization!
Long before Protestantism
was dreamed of Catholic states in
Italy had reached a degree of
wealth, power, and glory which no
Protestant nation&mdash;it is the confession
of one of their own historians&mdash;has
since attained.</p>

<p>There is, then, no reason in the
nature of things why the existing
condition of Catholics throughout
the world should remain as it is.
The blood that courses through our
veins, the graces given in our baptism,
the light of our faith, the
divine life-giving Bread we receive,
are all the same gifts and privileges
which we have in common with our
great ancestors. We are the children
of the same mighty mother,
ever fruitful of heroes and great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
men. The present state of things
is neither fatal nor final, but only
one of the many episodes in the
grand history of the church of
God.</p>

<h4>V. WHICH IS THE WAY OUT?</h4>

<p>No better evidence is needed of
the truth of the statements just
made than the fact that all Catholics
throughout the world are ill at
ease with things as they are. The
world at large is agitated, as it
never has been before, with problems
which enter into the essence
of religion or are closely connected
therewith. Many serious minds
are occupied with the question of
the renewal of religion and the regeneration
of society. The aspects
in which questions of this nature
are viewed are as various as the
remedies proposed are numerous.
Here are a few of the more important
ones.</p>

<p>One class of men would begin by
laboring for the reconciliation of
all Christian denominations, and
would endeavor to establish unity
in Christendom as the way to universal
restoration. Another class
starts with the idea that the remedy
would be found in giving a more
thorough and religious education to
youth in schools, colleges, and universities.
Some would renew the
church by translating her liturgies
into the vulgar tongues, by reducing
the number of her forms of devotion,
and by giving to her worship
greater simplicity. Others, again,
propose to alter the constitution of
the church by the practice of universal
elections in the hierarchy, by
giving the lay element a larger share
in the direction of ecclesiastical
matters, and by establishing national
churches. There are those who
hope for a better state of things by
placing Henry V. on the throne of
France, and Don Carlos on that of
Spain. Others, contrariwise, having
lost all confidence in princes,
look forward with great expectations
to a baptized democracy, a holy
Roman democracy, just as formerly
there was a Holy Roman Empire.
Not a few are occupied with the
idea of reconciling capital with labor,
of changing the tenure of
property, and abolishing standing
armies. Others propose a restoration
of international law, a congress
of nations, and a renewed and more
strict observance of the Decalogue.
According to another school, theological
motives have lost their hold
on the people, the task of directing
society has devolved upon science,
and its apostolate has begun. There
are those, moreover, who hold that
society can only be cured by an immense
catastrophe, and one hardly
knows what great cataclysm is to
happen and save the human race.
Finally, we are told that the reign
of Antichrist has begun, that signs
of it are everywhere, and that we
are on the eve of the end of the
world.</p>

<p>These are only a few of the projects,
plans, and remedies which
are discussed, and which more or
less occupy and agitate the public
mind. How much truth or
error, how much good or bad, each
or all of these theories contain,
would require a lifetime to find
out.</p>

<p>The remedy for our evils must be
got at, to be practical, in another
way. If a new life be imparted to
the root of a tree, its effects will
soon be seen in all its branches,
twigs, and leaves. Is it not possible
to get at the root of all our evils,
and with a radical remedy renew
at once the whole face of things?
Universal evils are not cured by
specifics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<h4>VI. THE WAY OUT.</h4>

<p>All things are to be viewed and
valued as they bear on the destiny
of man. Religion is the solution
of the problem of man’s destiny.
Religion, therefore, lies at the root
of everything which concerns man’s
true interest.</p>

<p>Religion means Christianity, to
all men, or to nearly all, who hold
to any religion among European
nations. Christianity, intelligibly
understood, signifies the church, the
Catholic Church. The church is
God acting through a visible organization
directly on men, and,
through men, on society.</p>

<p>The church is the sum of all
problems, and the most potent fact
in the whole wide universe. It is
therefore illogical to look elsewhere
for the radical remedy of all our
evils. It is equally unworthy of a
Catholic to look elsewhere for the
renewal of religion.</p>

<p>The meditation of these great
truths is the source from which the
inspiration must come, if society is
to be regenerated and the human
race directed to its true destination.
He who looks to any other
quarter for a radical and adequate
remedy and for true guidance is
doomed to failure and disappointment.</p>

<h4>VII. MISSION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.</h4>

<p>It cannot be too deeply and firmly
impressed on the mind that the
church is actuated by the instinct
of the Holy Spirit; and to discern
clearly its action, and to co-operate
with it effectually, is the highest
employment of our faculties, and at
the same time the primary source
of the greatest good to society.</p>

<p>Did we clearly see and understand
the divine action of the Holy
Spirit in the successive steps of the
history of the church, we would
fully comprehend the law of all true
progress. If in this later period
more stress was laid on the necessity
of obedience to the external authority
of the church than in former
days, it was, as has been shown,
owing to the peculiar dangers to
which the faithful were exposed.
It would be an inexcusable mistake
to suppose for a moment that the
holy church, at any period of her
existence, was ignorant or forgetful
of the mission and office of the
Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit established
the church, and can he forget
his own mission? It is true that
he has to guide and govern through
men, but he is the Sovereign of men,
and especially of those whom he
has chosen as his immediate instruments.</p>

<p>The essential and universal principle
which saves and sanctifies
souls is the Holy Spirit. He it was
who called, inspired, and sanctified
the patriarchs, the prophets and
saints of the old dispensation. The
same divine Spirit inspired and
sanctified the apostles, the martyrs,
and the saints of the new dispensation.
The actual and habitual
guidance of the soul by the Holy
Spirit is the essential principle of
all divine life. “I have taught the
prophets from the beginning, and
even till now I cease not to speak
to all.”<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Christ’s mission was to
give the Holy Spirit more abundantly.</p>

<p>No one who reads the Holy Scriptures
can fail to be struck with the
repeated injunctions to turn our
eyes inward, to walk in the divine
presence, to see and taste and listen
to God in the soul. These exhortations
run all through the inspired
books, beginning with that of Genesis,
and ending with the Revelations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of S. John. “I am the Almighty
God, walk before me, and be perfect,”<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
was the lesson which God
gave to the patriarch Abraham.
“Be still and see that I am God.”<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
“O taste, and see that the Lord is
sweet; blessed is the man that
hopeth in him.”<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> God is the guide,
the light of the living, and our
strength. “God’s kingdom is within
you,” said the divine Master.
“Know you not that you are the
temple of God, and that the Spirit
of God dwelleth in you?”<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> “For
it is God who worketh in you both
to will and to accomplish, according
to his will.”<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The object of
divine revelation was to make known
and to establish within the souls
of men, and through them upon the
earth, the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>In accordance with the Sacred
Scriptures, the Catholic Church
teaches that the Holy Spirit is infused,
with all his gifts, into our
souls by the sacrament of baptism,
and that, without his actual prompting
or inspiration and aid, no
thought or act, or even wish, tending
directly towards our true destiny,
is possible.</p>

<p>The whole aim of the science of
Christian perfection is to instruct
men how to remove the hindrances
in the way of the action of the Holy
Spirit, and how to cultivate those
virtues which are most favorable to
his solicitations and inspirations.
Thus the sum of spiritual life consists
in observing and fortifying the
ways and movements of the Spirit
of God in our soul, employing for
this purpose all the exercises of
prayer, spiritual reading, sacraments,
the practice of virtues, and
good works.</p>

<p>That divine action which is the
immediate and principal cause of
the salvation and perfection of the
soul claims by right its direct and
main attention. From this source
within the soul there will gradually
come to birth the consciousness of
the indwelling presence of the Holy
Spirit, out of which will spring a
force surpassing all human strength,
a courage higher than all human
heroism, a sense of dignity excelling
all human greatness. The light the
age requires for its renewal can
come only from the same source.
The renewal of the age depends on
the renewal of religion. The renewal
of religion depends upon a
greater effusion of the creative and
renewing power of the Holy Spirit.
The greater effusion of the Holy
Spirit depends on the giving of increased
attention to his movements
and inspirations in the soul. The
radical and adequate remedy for
all the evils of our age, and the
source of all true progress, consist
in increased attention and fidelity
to the action of the Holy Spirit in
the soul. “Thou shalt send forth
thy Spirit, and they shall be created:
and thou shalt renew the face of
the earth.”<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<h4>VIII. THE MEN THE AGE DEMANDS.</h4>

<p>This truth will be better seen by
looking at the matter a little more
in detail. The age, we are told,
calls for men worthy of that name.
Who are those worthy to be called
men? Men, assuredly, whose intelligences
and wills are divinely
illuminated and fortified. This is
precisely what is produced by the
gifts of the Holy Spirit; they enlarge
all the faculties of the soul at once.</p>

<p>The age is superficial; it needs
the gift of wisdom, which enables
the soul to contemplate truth in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
ultimate causes. The age is materialistic;
it needs the gift of intelligence,
by the light of which the intellect
penetrates into the essence of
things. The age is captivated by a
false and one-sided science; it needs
the gift of science, by the light of
which is seen each order of truth in
its true relations to other orders and
in a divine unity. The age is in disorder,
and is ignorant of the way to
true progress; it needs the gift of
counsel, which teaches how to
choose the proper means to attain
an object. The age is impious; it
needs the gift of piety, which leads
the soul to look up to God as the
Heavenly Father, and to adore him
with feelings of filial affection and
love. The age is sensual and effeminate;
it needs the gift of force,
which imparts to the will the
strength to endure the greatest burdens
and to prosecute the greatest
enterprises with ease and heroism.
The age has lost and almost
forgotten God; it needs the gift of
fear, to bring the soul again to God,
and make it feel conscious of its great
responsibility and of its destiny.</p>

<p>Men endowed with these gifts
are the men for whom&mdash;if it but
knew it&mdash;the age calls: men whose
minds are enlightened and whose
wills are strengthened by an increased
action of the Holy Spirit;
men whose souls are actuated by
the gifts of the Holy Spirit; men
whose countenances are lit up with
a heavenly joy, who breathe an air
of inward peace, and act with a holy
liberty and an unaccountable energy.
One such soul does more to
advance the kingdom of God than
tens of thousands without such gifts.
These are the men and this is the
way&mdash;if the age could only be made
to see and believe it&mdash;to universal
restoration, universal reconciliation,
and universal progress.</p>

<h4>IX. THE CHURCH HAS ENTERED ON THIS
WAY.</h4>

<p>The men the age and its needs
demand depend on a greater infusion
of the Holy Spirit in the souls
of the faithful; and the church has
been already prepared for this
event.</p>

<p>Can one suppose for a moment
that so long, so severe, a contest,
as that of the three centuries just
passed, which, moreover, has cost so
dearly, has not been fraught with
the greatest utility to the church?
Does God ever allow his church to
suffer loss in the struggle to accomplish
her divine mission?</p>

<p>It is true that the powerful and
persistent assaults of the errors of
the XVIth century against the
church forced her, so to speak, out
of the usual orbit of her movement;
but having completed her
defence from all danger on that
side, she is returning to her normal
course with increased agencies&mdash;thanks
to that contest&mdash;and is entering
upon a new and fresh phase
of life, and upon a more vigorous
action in every sphere of her existence.
The chiefest of these agencies,
and the highest in importance,
was that of the definition concerning
the nature of papal authority.
For the definition of the Vatican
Council, having rendered the supreme
authority of the church,
which is the unerring interpreter
and criterion of divinely-revealed
truth, more explicit and complete,
has prepared the way for the faithful
to follow, with greater safety
and liberty, the inspirations of the
Holy Spirit. The dogmatic papal
definition of the Vatican Council
is, therefore, the axis on which turn
the new course of the church, the
renewal of religion, and the entire
restoration of society.</p>

<p>O blessed fruit! purchased at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
price of so hard a struggle, but
which has gained for the faithful an
increased divine illumination and
force, and thereby the renewal of
the whole face of the world.</p>

<p>It is easy to perceive how great a
blunder the so-called “Old Catholics”
committed in opposing the
conciliar definition. They professed
a desire to see a more perfect
reign of the Holy Spirit in the
church, and by their opposition rejected,
so far as in them lay, the
very means of bringing it about!</p>

<p>This by the way: let us continue
our course, and follow the divine action
in the church, which is the initiator
and fountain-source of the
restoration of all things.</p>

<p>What is the meaning of these
many pilgrimages to holy places,
to the shrines of great saints, the
multiplication of Novenas and new
associations of prayer? Are they
not evidence of increased action
of the Holy Spirit on the faithful?
Why, moreover, these cruel persecutions,
vexatious fines, and numerous
imprisonments of the bishops,
clergy, and laity of the church?
What is the secret of this stripping
the church of her temporal possessions
and authority? These things
have taken place by the divine permission.
Have not all these inflictions
increased greatly devotion to
prayer, cemented more closely the
unity of the faithful, and turned the
attention of all members of the
church, from the highest to the lowest,
to look for aid from whence it
alone can come&mdash;from God?</p>

<p>These trials and sufferings of the
faithful are the first steps towards a
better state of things. They detach
from earthly things and purify the
human side of the church. From
them will proceed light and strength
and victory. <i lang="la">Per crucem ad lucem.</i>
“If the Lord wishes that other persecutions
should be sown, the
church feels no alarm; on the contrary,
persecutions purify her and
confer upon her a fresh force and a
new beauty. There are, in truth,
in the church certain things which
need purification, and for this
purpose those persecutions answer
best which are launched against
her by great politicians.” Such is
the language of Pius IX.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>These are only some of the movements,
which are public. But how
many souls in secret suffer sorely
in seeing the church in such tribulations,
and pray for her deliverance
with a fervor almost amounting to
agony! Are not all these but so
many preparatory steps to a Pentecostal
effusion of the Holy Spirit on
the church&mdash;an effusion, if not equal
in intensity to that of apostolic
days, at least greater than it in universality?
“If at no epoch of the
evangelical ages the reign of Satan
was so generally welcome as in this
our day, the action of the Holy Spirit
will have to clothe itself with the
characteristics of an exceptional extension
and force. The axioms of
geometry do not appear to us more
rigorously exact than this proposition.
A certain indefinable presentiment
of this necessity of a new effusion
of the Holy Spirit for the actual
world exists, and of this presentiment
the importance ought not to
be exaggerated; but yet it would
seem rash to make it of no account.”<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Is not this the meaning of the
presentiment of Pius IX., when he
said: “Since we have nothing, or
next to nothing, to expect from men,
let us place our confidence more
and more in God, whose heart is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
preparing, as it seems to me, to accomplish,
in the moment chosen by
himself, a great prodigy, which will
fill the whole earth with astonishment”?<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Was not the same presentiment
before the mind of De Maistre
when he penned the following lines:
“We are on the eve of the greatest
of religious epochs; … it appears
to me that every true philosopher
must choose between these two hypotheses:
either that a new religion
is about to be formed, or that Christianity
will be renewed in some extraordinary
manner”?<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<h4>X. TWOFOLD ACTION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.</h4>

<p>Before further investigation of
this new phase of the church, it
would perhaps be well to set aside
a doubt which might arise in the
minds of some, namely, whether
there is not danger in turning the attention
of the faithful in a greater
degree in the direction contemplated?</p>

<p>The enlargement of the field of
action for the soul, without a true
knowledge of the end and scope of
the external authority of the church,
would only open the door to delusions,
errors, and heresies of every
description, and would be in effect
merely another form of Protestantism.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the exclusive
view of the external authority of the
church, without a proper understanding
of the nature and work of
the Holy Spirit in the soul, would
render the practice of religion formal,
obedience servile, and the
church sterile.</p>

<p>The action of the Holy Spirit embodied
visibly in the authority of
the church, and the action of the
Holy Spirit dwelling invisibly in the
soul, form one inseparable synthesis;
and he who has not a clear
conception of this twofold action
of the Holy Spirit is in danger of
running into one or the other, and
sometimes into both, of these extremes,
either of which is destructive
of the end of the church.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit, in the external
authority of the church, acts as the
infallible interpreter and criterion
of divine revelation. The Holy
Spirit in the soul acts as the divine
Life-Giver and Sanctifier. It is of
the highest importance that these
two distinct offices of the Holy Spirit
should not be confounded.</p>

<p>The supposition that there can
be any opposition or contradiction
between the action of the Holy Spirit
in the supreme decisions of the authority
of the church, and the inspirations
of the Holy Spirit in the soul,
can never enter the mind of an
enlightened and sincere Christian.
The same Spirit which through the
authority of the church teaches
divine truth, is the same Spirit
which prompts the soul to receive
the divine truths which he teaches.
The measure of our love for the
Holy Spirit is the measure of our
obedience to the authority of the
church; and the measure of our
obedience to the authority of the
church is the measure of our love
for the Holy Spirit. Hence the sentence
of S. Augustine: “<i lang="la">Quantum
quisque amat ecclesiam Dei, tantum
habet Spiritum Sanctum</i>.” There is
one Spirit, which acts in two different
offices concurring to the same
end&mdash;the regeneration and sanctification
of the soul.</p>

<p>In case of obscurity or doubt
concerning what is the divinely-revealed
truth, or whether what
prompts the soul is or is not an inspiration
of the Holy Spirit, recourse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
must be had to the divine teacher
or criterion, the authority of the
church. For it must be borne in
mind that to the church, as represented
in the first instance by S.
Peter, and subsequently by his successors,
was made the promise of
her divine Founder that “the gates
of hell should never prevail against
her.”<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> No such promise was ever
made by Christ to each individual
believer. “The church of the living
God is the pillar and ground of
truth.”<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The test, therefore, of a
truly enlightened and sincere Christian,
will be, in case of uncertainty,
the promptitude of his obedience
to the voice of the church.</p>

<p>From the above plain truths the
following practical rule of conduct
may be drawn: The Holy Spirit is
the immediate guide of the soul in
the way of salvation and sanctification;
and the criterion or test that
the soul is guided by the Holy Spirit
is its ready obedience to the authority
of the church. This rule removes
all danger whatever, and
with it the soul can walk, run, or
fly, if it chooses, in the greatest
safety and with perfect liberty, in
the ways of sanctity.</p>

<h4>XI. NEW PHASE OF THE CHURCH.</h4>

<p>There are signs which indicate
that the members of the church
have not only entered upon a
deeper and more spiritual life, but
that from the same source has arisen
a new phase of their intellectual activity.</p>

<p>The notes of the divine institution
of the church&mdash;and the credibility
of divine revelation&mdash;with her constitution
and organization, having
been in the main completed on the
external side, the notes which now
require special attention and study
are those respecting her divine
character, which lie on the internal
side.</p>

<p>The mind of the church has been
turned in this direction for some
time past. One has but to read the
several Encyclical letters of the
present reigning Supreme Pontiff,
and the decrees of the Vatican
Council, to be fully convinced of
this fact.</p>

<p>No pontiff has so strenuously upheld
the value and rights of human
reason as Pius IX.; and no council
has treated so fully of the relations
of the natural with the supernatural
as that of the Vatican. It must be
remembered the work of both is not
yet concluded. Great mission that,
to fix for ever those truths so long
held in dispute, and to open the
door to the fuller knowledge of
other and still greater verities!</p>

<p>It is the divine action of the Holy
Spirit in and through the church
which gives her external organization
the reason for its existence.
And it is the fuller explanation of
the divine side of the church and
its relations with her human side,
giving always to the former its due
accentuation, that will contribute
to the increase of the interior life
of the faithful, and aid powerfully
to remove the blindness of those&mdash;whose
number is much larger than
is commonly supposed&mdash;who only
see the church on her human side.</p>

<p>As an indication of these studies,
the following mere suggestions,
concerning the relations of the internal
with the external side of the
church, are here given.</p>

<p>The practical aim of all true religion
is to bring each individual
soul under the immediate guidance
of the divine Spirit. The divine
Spirit communicates himself to the
soul by means of the sacraments of
the church. The divine Spirit acts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
as the interpreter and criterion of
revealed truth by the authority of
the church. The divine Spirit acts
as the principle of regeneration
and sanctification in each Christian
soul. The same Spirit clothes with
suitable ceremonies and words the
truths of religion and the interior
life of the soul in the liturgy and
devotions of the church. The divine
Spirit acts as the safeguard
of the life of the soul and of the
household of God in the discipline
of the church. The divine Spirit
established the church as the practical
and perfect means of bringing
all souls under his own immediate
guidance and into complete union
with God. This is the realization
of the aim of all true religion.
Thus all religions, viewed in the
aspect of a divine life, find their
common centre in the Catholic
Church.</p>

<p>The greater part of the intellectual
errors of the age arise from a
lack of knowledge of the essential
relations of the light of faith with
the light of reason; of the connection
between the mysteries and
truths of divine revelation and those
discovered and attainable by human
reason; of the action of divine grace
and the action of the human will.</p>

<p>The early Greek and Latin fathers
of the church largely cultivated
this field. The scholastics greatly
increased the riches received
from their predecessors. And had
not the attention of the church
been turned aside from its course
by the errors of the XVIth century,
the demonstration of Christianity
on its intrinsic side would ere this
have received its finishing strokes.
The time has come to take up this
work, continue it where it was
interrupted, and bring it to completion.
Thanks to the Encyclicals
of Pius IX. and the decisions of the
Vatican Council, this task will not
now be so difficult.</p>

<p>Many, if not most, of the distinguished
apologists of Christianity,
theologians, philosophers, and
preachers, either by their writings
or eloquence, have already entered
upon this path. The recently-published
volumes, and those issuing
day by day from the press, in
exposition, or defence, or apology
of Christianity, are engaged in this
work.</p>

<p>This explanation of the internal
life and constitution of the church,
and of the intelligible side of the
mysteries of faith and the intrinsic
reasons for the truths of divine
revelation, giving to them their due
emphasis, combined with the external
notes of credibility, would complete
the demonstration of Christianity.
Such an exposition of
Christianity, the union of the internal
with the external notes of
credibility, is calculated to produce
a more enlightened and intense
conviction of its divine truth in the
faithful, to stimulate them to a
more energetic personal action;
and, what is more, it would open
the door to many straying, but not
altogether lost, children, for their
return to the fold of the church.</p>

<p>The increased action of the Holy
Spirit, with a more vigorous co-operation
on the part of the faithful,
which is in process of realization,
will elevate the human personality
to an intensity of force
and grandeur productive of a new
era to the church and to society&mdash;an
era difficult for the imagination
to grasp, and still more difficult to
describe in words, unless we have
recourse to the prophetic language
of the inspired Scriptures.</p>

<p>Is not such a demonstration of
Christianity and its results anticipated
in the following words?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“We are about to see,” said
Schlegel, “a new exposition of
Christianity, which will reunite all
Christians, and even bring back the
infidels themselves.” “This reunion
between science and faith,”
says the Protestant historian Ranke,
“will be more important in its
spiritual results than was the discovery
of a new hemisphere three
hundred years ago, or even than
that of the true system of the world,
or than any other discovery of any
kind whatever.”</p>

<h4>XII. MISSION OF RACES.</h4>

<p>Pursuing our study of the action
of the Holy Spirit, we shall perceive
that a deeper and more explicit exposition
of the divine side of the
church, in view of the characteristic
gifts of different races, is the
way or means of realizing the hopes
above expressed.</p>

<p>God is the author of the differing
races of men. He, for his own good
reasons, has stamped upon them
their characteristics, and appointed
them from the beginning their
places which they are to fill in his
church.</p>

<p>In a matter where there are so
many tender susceptibilities, it is
highly important not to overrate
the peculiar gifts of any race, nor,
on the other hand, to underrate
them or exaggerate their vices or
defects. Besides, the different races
in modern Europe have been
brought so closely together, and
have been mingled to such an extent,
that their differences can only
be detected in certain broad and
leading features.</p>

<p>It would be also a grave mistake,
in speaking of the providential mission
of the races, to suppose that
they imposed their characteristics
on religion, Christianity, or the
church; whereas, on the contrary,
it is their Author who has employed
in the church their several gifts for
the expression and development of
those truths for which he specially
created them. The church is God
acting through the different races
of men for their highest development,
together with their present
and future greatest happiness and
his own greatest glory. “God
directs the nations upon the
earth.”<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Every leading race of men, or
great nation, fills a large space in
the general history of the world.
It is an observation of S. Augustine
that God gave the empire of the
world to the Romans as a reward
for their civic virtues. But it is a
matter of surprise how large and
important a part divine Providence
has appointed special races to take
in the history of religion. It is here
sufficient merely to mention the
Israelites.</p>

<p>One cannot help being struck with
the mission of the Latin and Celtic
races during the greater period of
the history of Christianity. What
brought them together in the first
instance was the transference of
the chair of S. Peter, the centre of
the church, to Rome, the centre of
the Latin race. Rome, then, was
the embodied expression of a perfectly-organized,
world-wide power.
Rome was the political, and, by its
great roads, the geographical, centre
of the world.</p>

<p>What greatly contributed to the
predominance of the Latin race, and
subsequently of the Celts in union
with the Latins, was the abandonment
of the church by the Greeks
by schism, and the loss of the larger
portion of the Saxons by the errors
and revolt of the XVIth century.
The faithful, in consequence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
were almost exclusively composed
of Latin-Celts.</p>

<p>The absence of the Greeks and
of so large a portion of the Saxons,
whose tendencies and prejudices in
many points are similar, left a freer
course and an easier task to the
church, through her ordinary channels
of action, as well as through her
extraordinary ones&mdash;the Councils,
namely, of Trent and the Vatican&mdash;to
complete her authority and external
constitution. For the Latin-Celtic
races are characterized by
hierarchical, traditional, and emotional
tendencies.</p>

<p>These were the human elements
which furnished the church with
the means of developing and completing
her supreme authority, her
divine and ecclesiastical traditions,
her discipline, her devotions, and,
in general, her æsthetics.</p>

<h4>XIII. SOME OF THE CAUSES OF PROTESTANTISM.</h4>

<p>It was precisely the importance
given to the external constitution
and to the accessories of the
church which excited the antipathies
of the Saxons, which culminated
in the so-called Reformation.
For the Saxon races and the
mixed Saxons, the English and
their descendants, predominate in
the rational element, in an energetic
individuality, and in great
practical activity in the material
order.</p>

<p>One of the chief defects of the
Saxon mind lay in not fully understanding
the constitution of the
church, or sufficiently appreciating
the essential necessity of her external
organization. Hence their
misinterpretation of the providential
action of the Latin-Celts, and
their charges against the church of
formalism, superstition, and popery.
They wrongfully identified the excesses
of those races with the
church of God. They failed to
take into sufficient consideration
the great and constant efforts the
church had made, in her national
and general councils, to correct the
abuses and extirpate the vices
which formed the staple of their
complaints.</p>

<p>Conscious, also, of a certain feeling
of repression of their natural
instincts, while this work of the
Latin-Celts was being perfected,
they at the same time felt a great
aversion to the increase of externals
in outward worship, and to
the minute regulations in discipline,
as well as to the growth of
papal authority and the outward
grandeur of the papal court. The
Saxon leaders in heresy of the
XVIth century, as well as those of
our own day, cunningly taking advantage
of those antipathies, united
with selfish political considerations,
succeeded in making a large
number believe that the question
in controversy was not what it
really was&mdash;a question, namely, between
Christianity and infidelity&mdash;but
a question between Romanism
and Germanism!</p>

<p>It is easy to foresee the result of
such a false issue; for it is impossible,
humanly speaking, that a religion
can maintain itself among a
people when once they are led to
believe it wrongs their natural instincts,
is hostile to their national
development, or is unsympathetic
with their genius.</p>

<p>With misunderstandings, weaknesses,
and jealousies on both sides,
these, with various other causes,
led thousands and millions of Saxons
and Anglo-Saxons to resistance,
hatred, and, finally, open revolt
against the authority of the
church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<h4>XIV. PRESENT SAXON PERSECUTIONS.</h4>

<p>The same causes which mainly
produced the religious rebellion of
the XVIth century are still at
work among the Saxons, and are
the exciting motives of their present
persecutions against the
church.</p>

<p>Looking through the distorted
medium of their Saxon prejudices,
grown stronger with time, and
freshly stimulated by the recent
definition of Papal Infallibility,
they have worked themselves into
the belief&mdash;seeing the church only
on the outside, as they do&mdash;that
she is purely a human institution,
grown slowly, by the controlling
action of the Latin-Celtic instincts,
through centuries, to her present
formidable proportions. The doctrines,
the sacraments, the devotions,
the worship of the Catholic
Church, are, for the most part, from
their stand-point, corruptions of
Christianity, having their source in
the characteristics of the Latin-Celtic
races. The papal authority,
to their sight, is nothing else than
the concentration of the sacerdotal
tendencies of these races, carried
to their culminating point by the
recent Vatican definition, which
was due, in the main, to the efforts
and the influence exerted by the
Jesuits. This despotic ecclesiastical
authority, which commands a
superstitious reverence and servile
submission to all its decrees,
teaches doctrines inimical to the
autonomy of the German Empire,
and has fourteen millions or more
of its subjects under its sway,
ready at any moment to obey, at
all hazards, its decisions. What is
to hinder this ultramontane power
from issuing a decree, in a critical moment,
which will disturb the peace
and involve, perhaps, the overthrow
of that empire, the fruit of so great
sacrifices, and the realization of the
ardent aspirations of the Germanic
races? Is it not a dictate of self-preservation
and political prudence
to remove so dangerous an
element, and that at all costs, from
the state? Is it not a duty to free
so many millions of our German
brethren from this superstitious
yoke and slavish subjection? Has
not divine Providence bestowed
the empire of Europe upon the
Saxons, and placed us Prussians at
its head, in order to accomplish,
with all the means at our disposal,
this great work? Is not this a
duty which we owe to ourselves, to
our brother Germans, and, above all,
to God? This supreme effort is
our divine mission!</p>

<p>This picture of the Catholic
Church, as it appears to a large
class of non-Catholic German
minds, is not overdrawn. It admits
of higher coloring, and it
would still be true and even more
exact.</p>

<p>This is the monster which the too
excited imagination and the deeply-rooted
prejudice of the Saxon mind
have created, and called, by way of
contempt, the “Latin,” the “Romish,”
the “Popish” Church. It is
against this monster that they direct
their persistent attacks, their
cruel persecutions, animated with
the fixed purpose of accomplishing
its entire overthrow.</p>

<p>Is this a thing to be marvelled at,
when Catholics themselves abhor
and detest this caricature of the
Catholic Church&mdash;for it is nothing
else&mdash;more than these men do, or
possibly can do?</p>

<p>The attitude of the German Empire,
and of the British Empire also,
until the Emancipation Act, <i lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i>
to the Catholic Church as they
conceive her to be, may, stripped
of all accidental matter, be stated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
thus: Either adapt Latin Christianity,
the Romish Church, to the
Germanic type of character and to
the exigencies of the empire, or we
will employ all the forces and all
the means at our disposal to stamp
out Catholicity within our dominions,
and to exterminate its existence,
as far as our authority and
influence extend!</p>

<h4>XV. RETURN OF THE SAXON RACES TO
THE CHURCH.</h4>

<p>The German mind, when once it
is bent upon a course, is not easily
turned aside, and the present out-look
for the church in Germany is
not, humanly speaking, a pleasant
one to contemplate. It is an old
and common saying that “Truth is
mighty, and will prevail.” But why?
“Truth is mighty” because it is
calculated to convince the mind, captivate
the soul, and solicit its uttermost
devotion and action. “Truth
will prevail,” provided it is so presented
to the mind as to be seen
really as it is. It is only when the
truth is unknown or disfigured that
the sincere repel it.</p>

<p>The return, therefore, of the
Saxon races to the church, is to be
hoped for, not by trimming divine
truth, nor by altering the constitution
of the church, nor by what are
called concessions. Their return
is to be hoped for, by so presenting
the divine truth to their minds that
they can see that it is divine truth.
This will open their way to the
church in harmony with their genuine
instincts, and in her bosom they
will find the realization of that career
which their true aspirations
point out for them. For the Holy
Spirit, of which the church is the
organ and expression, places every
soul, and therefore all nations and
races, in the immediate and perfect
relation with their supreme end,
God, in whom they obtain their
highest development, happiness, and
glory, both in this life and in the
life to come.</p>

<p>The church, as has been shown,
has already entered on this path
of presenting more intimately and
clearly her inward and divine side
to the world; for her deepest and
most active thinkers are actually
engaged, more or less consciously,
in this providential work.</p>

<p>In showing more fully the relations
of the internal with the external
side of the church, keeping in
view the internal as the end and
aim of all, the mystic tendencies
of the German mind will truly appreciate
the interior life of the
church, and find in it their highest
satisfaction. By penetrating more
deeply into the intelligible side of
the mysteries of faith and the intrinsic
reasons for revealed truth
and the existence of the church, the
strong rational tendencies of the
Saxon mind will seize hold of, and
be led to apprehend, the intrinsic
reasons for Christianity. The
church will present herself to their
minds as the practical means of establishing
the complete reign of the
Holy Spirit in the soul, and, consequently,
of bringing the kingdom
of heaven upon earth. This is the
ideal conception of Christianity,
entertained by all sincere believers
in Christ among non-Catholics in
Europe and the United States.
This exposition, and an increased action
of the Holy Spirit in the church
co-operating therewith, would complete
their conviction of the divine
character of the church and of the
divinity of Christianity.</p>

<p>All this may seem highly speculative
and of no practical bearing.
But it has precisely such a bearing,
if one considers, in connection with
it, what is now going on throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the Prussian kingdom and other
parts of Germany, including Switzerland.
What is it which we see in
all these regions? A simultaneous
and persistent determination to destroy,
by every species of persecution,
the Catholic Church. Now,
the general law of persecution is
the conversion of the persecutors.</p>

<p>Through the cross Christ began
the redemption of the world;
through the cross the redemption
of the world is to be continued and
completed. It was mainly by the
shedding of the blood of the martyrs
that the Roman Empire was
gained to the faith. Their conquerors
were won by the toil, heroic
labors and sufferings of saintly
missionaries. The same law holds
good in regard to modern persecutors.
The question is not how
shall the German Empire be overthrown,
or of waiting in anticipation
of its destruction, or how shall the
church withstand its alarming persecutions?
The great question is
how shall the blindness be removed
from the eyes of the persecutors of
the church, and how can they be
led to see her divine beauty, holiness,
and truth, which at present
are hidden from their sight? The
practical question is how shall the
church gain over the great German
empire to the cause of Christ?</p>

<p>O blessed persecutions! if, in addition
to the divine virtues, which
they will bring forth to light by the
sufferings of the faithful, they serve
also to lead the champions of the
faith to seek for and employ such
proofs and arguments as the Saxon
mind cannot withstand, producing
conviction in their intelligence, and
striking home the truth to their
hearts; and in this way, instead of
incurring defeat, they will pluck
out of the threatening jaws of this
raging German wolf the sweet fruit
of victory.</p>

<p>This view is eminently practical,
when you consider that the same
law which applies to the persecutors
of the church applies equally
to the leading or governing races.
This is true from the beginning of
the church. The great apostles
S. Peter and S. Paul did not stop
in Jerusalem, but turned their eyes
and steps towards all-conquering,
all-powerful Rome. Their faith
and their heroism, sealed with their
martyrdom, after a long and bloody
contest, obtained the victory. The
imperial Roman eagles became
proud to carry aloft the victorious
cross of Christ! The Goths, the
Huns, and Vandals came; the contest
was repeated, the victory too;
and they were subdued to the sweet
yoke of Christ, and incorporated in
the bosom of his church.</p>

<p>Is this rise of the Germanic Empire,
in our day, to be considered
only as a passing occurrence, and
are we to suppose that things will
soon again take their former course?
Or is it to be thought of as a real
change in the direction of the
world’s affairs, under the lead of
the dominant Saxon races? If the
history of the human race from its
cradle can be taken as a rule, the
course of empire is ever northward.
Be that as it may, the Saxons have
actually in their hands, and are resolutely
determined to keep, the
ruling power in Europe, if not in
the world. And the church is a divine
queen, and her aim has always
been to win to her bosom the imperial
races. She has never failed
to do it, too!</p>

<p>Think you these people are for
the most part actuated by mere
malice, and are persecuting the
church with knowledge of what
they are doing? The question is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
not of their prominent leaders and
the actual apostates. There may
be future prodigal sons even
amongst these. Does not the
church suffer from their hands in
a great measure what her divine
Founder suffered when he was nailed
to the cross, and cried, “Father,
forgive them, they know not what
they do”?</p>

<p>The persecutors in the present
generation are not to be judged as
those who were born in the church,
and who, knowing her divine character,
by an unaccountable defection,
turned their backs upon her.
Will their stumbling prove a fatal
fall to all their descendants? God
forbid! Their loss for a time has
proved a gain to the church, and
their return will bring riches to
both, and through them to the
whole world; “for God is able to
ingraft them again.”<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The Catholic Church unveils to
the penetrating intelligence of the
Saxon races her divine internal life
and beauty; to their energetic individuality
she proposes its elevation
to a divine manhood; and to
their great practical activity she
opens the door to its employment
in spreading the divine faith over
the whole world!</p>

<p>That which will hasten greatly
the return of the Saxons to the
church is the progressive action of
the controlling and dissolving elements
of Protestantism towards the
entire negation of all religion. For
the errors contained in every heresy,
which time never fails to produce,
involve its certain extinction.
Many born in those errors, clearly
foreseeing these results, have already
returned to the fold of the
church. This movement will be
accelerated by the more rapid dissolution
of Protestantism, consequent
on its being placed recently
under similar hostile legislation in
Switzerland and Germany with the
Catholic Church. “The blows
struck at the Church of Rome,”
such is the acknowledgment of one
of its own organs, “tell with redoubled
force against the evangelical
church.”</p>

<p>With an intelligent positive movement
on the part of the church, and
by the actual progressive negative
one operating in Protestantism, that
painful wound inflicted in the
XVIth century on Christianity will
be soon, let us hope, closed up and
healed, never again to be reopened.</p>

<h4>XVI. MIXED SAXONS RETURNING.</h4>

<p>Christ blamed the Jews, who were
skilful in detecting the signs of
change in the weather, for their
want of skill in discerning the signs
of the times. There are evidences,
and where we should first expect
to meet them&mdash;namely, among the
mixed Saxon races, the people of
England and the United States&mdash;of
this return to the true church.</p>

<p>The mixture of the Anglo-Saxons
with the blood of the Celts in former
days caused them to retain, at
the time of the so-called Reformation,
more of the doctrines, worship,
and organization of the Catholic
Church than did the thorough
Saxons of Germany. It is for the
same reason that among them are
manifested the first unmistakable
symptoms of their entrance once
more into the bosom of the church.</p>

<p>At different epochs movements
in this direction have taken place,
but never so serious and general as
at the present time. The character
and the number of the converts
from Anglicanism to the Catholic
Church gave, in the beginning, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
great alarm to the English nation.
But now it has become reconciled
to the movement, which continues
and takes its course among the
more intelligent and influential
classes, and that notwithstanding
the spasmodic cry of alarm of Lord
John Russell and the more spiteful
attack of the Right Hon. William E.
Gladstone, M.P., late prime minister.</p>

<p>It is clear to those who have eyes
to see such things that God is bestowing
special graces upon the
English people in our day, and that
the hope is not without solid foundation
which looks forward to the
time when England shall again take
rank among the Catholic nations.</p>

<p>The evidences of a movement towards
the Catholic Church are still
clearer and more general in the
United States. There is less prejudice
and hostility against the church
in the United States than in England,
and hence her progress is
much greater.</p>

<p>The Catholics, in the beginning
of this century, stood as one to
every two hundred of the whole
population of the American Republic.
The ratio of Catholics now is
one to six or seven of the inhabitants.
The Catholics will outnumber,
before the close of this century,
all other believers in Christianity
put together in the republic.</p>

<p>This is no fanciful statement, but
one based on a careful study of statistics,
and the estimate is moderate.
Even should emigration from
Catholic countries to the United
States cease altogether&mdash;which it
will not&mdash;or even should it greatly
diminish, the supposed loss or diminution,
in this source of augmentation,
will be fully compensated by
the relative increase of births among
the Catholics, as compared with
that among other portions of the
population.</p>

<p>The spirit, the tendencies, and
the form of political government
inherited by the people of the United
States are strongly and distinctively
Saxon; yet there are no more
patriotic or better citizens in the
republic than the Roman Catholics,
and no more intelligent, practical,
and devoted Catholics in the
church than the seven millions of
Catholics in this same young and
vigorous republic. The Catholic
faith is the only persistently progressive
religious element, compared
with the increase of population,
in the United States. A striking
proof that the Catholic Church
flourishes wherever there is honest
freedom and wherever human nature
has its full share of liberty!
Give the Catholic Church equal
rights and fair play, and she will
again win Europe, and with Europe
the world.</p>

<p>Now, who will venture to assert
that these two mixed Saxon nations,
of England and the United States,
are not, in the order of divine Providence,
the appointed leaders of
the great movement of the return
of all the Saxons to the Holy Catholic
Church?</p>

<p>The sun, in his early dawn, first
touches the brightest mountain-tops,
and, advancing in his course,
floods the deepest valleys with his
glorious light; and so the Sun of divine
grace has begun to enlighten
the minds in the highest stations in
life in England, in the United States,
and in Germany; and what human
power will impede the extension of
its holy light to the souls of the
whole population of these countries?</p>

<h4>XVII. TRANSITION OF THE LATIN-CELTS</h4>

<p>Strange action of divine Providence
in ruling the nations of this
earth! While the Saxons are about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
to pass from a natural to a supernatural
career, the Latin-Celts are
impatient for, and have already entered
upon, a natural one. What
does this mean? Are these races
to change their relative positions
before the face of the world?</p>

<p>The present movement of transition
began on the part of the Latin-Celtic
nations in the last century
among the French people, who of
all these nations stand geographically
the nearest, and whose blood
is most mingled with that of the
Saxons. That transition began in
violence, because it was provoked
to a premature birth by the circumstance
that the control exercised
by the church as the natural moderator
of the Christian republic of
Europe was set aside by Protestantism,
particularly so in France,
in consequence of a diluted dose of
the same Protestantism under the
name of Gallicanism. Exempt from
this salutary control, kings and the
aristocracy oppressed the people at
their own will and pleasure; and
the people, in turn, wildly rose up
in their might, and cut off, at their
own will and pleasure, the heads of
the kings and aristocrats. Louis
XIV., in his pride, said, “L’Etat
c’est moi!” The people replied, in
their passion, “L’Etat c’est nous!”</p>

<p>Under the guidance of the church
the transformation from feudalism
to all that is included under the
title of modern citizenship was effected
with order, peace, and benefit
to all classes concerned. Apart
from this aid, society pendulates
from despotism to anarchy, and
from anarchy to despotism. The
French people at the present moment
are groping about, and earnestly
seeking after the true path of
progress, which they lost some time
back by their departure from the
Christian order of society.</p>

<p>The true movement of Christian
progress was turned aside into destructive
channels, and this movement,
becoming revolutionary, has
passed in our day to the Italian and
Spanish nations.</p>

<p>Looking at things in their broad
features, Christianity is at this moment
exposed to the danger, on the
one hand, of being exterminated by
the persecutions of the Saxon races,
and, on the other, of being denied
by the apostasy of the Latin-Celts.
This is the great tribulation of the
present hour of the church. She
feels the painful struggle. The destructive
work of crushing out
Christianity by means of these hostile
tendencies has already begun.
If, as some imagine, the Christian
faith be only possible at the sacrifice
of human nature, and if a natural
career be only possible at the
sacrifice of the Christian faith, it
requires no prophetic eye to foresee
the sad results to the Christian religion
at no distant future.</p>

<p>But it is not so. The principles already
laid down and proclaimed to
the world by the church answer satisfactorily
these difficulties. What
the age demands, what society is
seeking for, rightly interpreted, is
the knowledge of these principles
and their practical application to its
present needs.</p>

<p>For God is no less the author of
nature than of grace, of reason than
of faith, of this earth than of heaven.</p>

<p>The Word by which all things
were made that were made, and the
Word which was made flesh, is one
and the same Word. The light
which enlighteneth every man that
cometh into this world, and the
light of Christian faith, are, although
differing in degree, the same light.
“There is therefore nothing so
foolish or so absurd,” to use the
words of Pius IX. on the same subject,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
“as to suppose there can be
any opposition between them.”<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
Their connection is intimate, their
relation is primary; they are, in essence,
one. For what else did
Christ become man than to establish
the kingdom of God on earth,
as the way to the kingdom of God
in heaven?</p>

<p>It cannot be too often repeated to
the men of this generation, so many
of whom are trying to banish and
forget God, that God, and God
alone, is the Creator and Renewer
of the world. The same God who
made all things, and who became
man, and began the work of regeneration,
is the same who really acts
in the church now upon men and
society, and who has pledged his
word to continue to do so until the
end of the world. To be guided
by God’s church is to be guided by
God. It is in vain to look elsewhere.
“Society,” as the present
pontiff has observed, “has been enclosed
in a labyrinth, out of which
it will never issue save by the hand
of God.”<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The hand of God is the
church. It is this hand he is extending,
in a more distinctive and
attractive form, to this present generation.
Blessed generation, if it
can only be led to see this outstretched
hand, and to follow the
path of all true progress, which it
so clearly points out!</p>

<h4>XVIII. PERSPECTIVE OF THE FUTURE.</h4>

<p>During the last three centuries,
from the nature of the work the
church had to do, the weight of her
influence had to be mainly exerted
on the side of restraining human
activity. Her present and future
influence, due to the completion of
her external organization, will be
exerted on the side of soliciting increased
action. The first was necessarily
repressive and unpopular;
the second will be, on the contrary,
expansive and popular. The one
excited antagonism; the other
will attract sympathy and cheerful
co-operation. The former restraint
was exercised, not against human
activity, but against the exaggeration
of that activity. The future
will be the solicitation of the same
activity towards its elevation and
divine expansion, enhancing its
fruitfulness and glory.</p>

<p>These different races of Europe
and the United States, constituting
the body of the most civilized nations
of the world, united in an intelligent
appreciation of the divine
character of the church, with their
varied capacities and the great
agencies at their disposal, would be
the providential means of rapidly
spreading the light of faith over the
whole world, and of constituting a
more Christian state of society.</p>

<p>In this way would be reached a
more perfect realization of the prediction
of the prophets, of the
promises and prayers of Christ, and
of the true aspiration of all noble
souls.</p>

<p>This is what the age is calling for,
if rightly understood, in its countless
theories and projects of reform.</p>

<h3>ODD STORIES.<br />
IX.<br />
KURDIG.</h3>

<p>The sun was setting in the vale
of Kashmir. Under the blessing
of its rays the admiring fakir would
again have said that here undoubtedly
was the place of the earthly
paradise where mankind was born
in the morning of the world.
Something of the same thought
may have stirred the mind of a
dwarfed and hump-backed man
with bow-legs, who, from carrying
on his shoulders a heavy barrel up
the steep and crooked path of a
hillside, stopped to rest while he
looked mournfully at the sun.
Herds of goats that strayed near
him, and flocks of sheep that grazed
below, might have provoked their
deformed neighbor to envy their
shapely and well-clad beauty and
peaceful movements. Could he
have found it in his heart to curse
the sun which had seemed to view
with such complacency his hard toils
amid the burden and heat of the
day, the compassionate splendor of
its last look upon field, river, and
mountain would still have touched
his soul. As it was, he saw that
earth and heaven were beautiful,
and that he was not. Whether he
uttered it or not, his keen, sad eyes
and thoughtful face were a lament
that his hard lot had made him the
one ugly feature in that gentle
scene. No, not the only one; he
shared his singularity with the little
green snake that now crawled near
his feet. Yet even this reptile, he
thought, could boast its sinuous
beauty, its harmony with the order
of things; for it was a perfect snake,
and he&mdash;well, he was scarce a man.
Soon, however, better thoughts
took possession of his mind, and,
when he shouldered his barrel to
climb the hill, he thought that one
of those beautiful peris, whose mission
it is to console earth’s sorrowing
children ere yet their wings are
admitted to heaven, thus murmured
in his ear, with a speech that was
like melody: “O Kurdig, child of
toil! thy lot is indeed hard, but
thou bearest it not for thyself
alone, and thy master and rewarder
hath set thee thy task; and for this
thou shalt have the unseen for thy
friends, love for thy thought, and
heaven for thy solace.” As he ascended
the hill it seemed to him
that his load grew lighter, as if by
help of invisible hands. He looked
for a moment on the snake which
hissed at him, and though but an
hour ago, moved by a feud as old
as man, he would have ground it in
hate beneath his foot, he now let it
pass. The crooked man ascended
the hill, while the crooked serpent
passed downward; and it was as
if one understood the other. At
length the dwarf Kurdig reached
the yard of the palace, which stood
on a shady portion of the eminence,
but, as he laid down his burden
with a smile and a good word
before his employer, suddenly he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
felt the sharp cut of a whip across
the shoulders. He writhed and
smarted, feeling as if the old serpent
had stung him.</p>

<p>Kurdig was one of those hewers
of wood and drawers of water whose
daily being in the wonderful vale
of Kashmir seemed but a harsh contrast
of fallen man with the paradise
that once was his home. When he
did not carry barrels of wine, or
fruit-loads, or other burdens to the
top of the hill, he assisted his poor
sister and her child in the task of
making shawls for one of a number
of large shawl-dealers who gave employment
to the people of the valley.
With them the dearest days of his
life were spent. At odd times he
taught the little girl the names of
flowers, the virtues of herbs, and
even how to read and write&mdash;no
small accomplishments among peasant
folk, and only gained by the
dwarf himself because his mind was
as patient and as shrewd as his body
was misshapen. His great desire
for all useful knowledge found exercise
in all the common stores of
mother-wit and rustic science which
the unlettered people around preserved
as their inheritance. How to
build houses, to make chairs, ovens,
hats; how to catch fish and conduct
spring-waters; how to apply
herbs for cure and healing; how to
make oils and crude wine&mdash;these
things he knew as none other of all
the peasantry about could pretend
to know. He had seen, too,
and had sometimes followed in
the hunt, the beasts of the forest;
nor was he, as we have seen, afraid
of reptiles. He could row and
swim, and while others danced he
could sing and play. This variety
of accomplishments slowly acquired
for the dwarf an influence which,
though little acknowledged, was
widespread. In all the work and
play of the rude folk around him
he was the almost innocent and
unregarded master-spirit. The improvement
of their houses owed
something to his hand, and their
feasts were in good part planned by
him; for, while he acted as their
servant, he was in truth their master.
To cure the common fevers,
aches, hurts, he had well-tried
simples, and his searches and experiments
had added something
new to the herbal remedies of his
fathers. All his talents as doctor,
musician, mechanic, and story-teller
his neighbors did not fail to
make use of, while the dwarf still
kept in the background, and his
ugliness, whenever accident had
made him at all prominent, was
laughed at as much as ever. Even
the poor creatures his knowledge
had cured, and his good-nature had
not tasked to pay him, uttered a
careless laugh when they praised
their physician, as if they said:
“Well, who would have thought
the ugly little crook-back was so
cunning?”</p>

<p>Yet there was one who never
joined in the general smile which
accompanied the announcement of
the name of Kurdig. This was his
sister’s child. Never without pain
could she hear his name jestingly
mentioned; always with reverence,
and sometimes with tears, she spoke
of him. The wan, slender child
had grown almost from its feeble
infancy by the side of the dwarf.
When able to leave her mother’s
sole care, he had taught the child
her first games and songs, and step
by step had instructed her in all
the rude home-lessons prevalent
among the country people&mdash;how to
knit, to weave, to read and to write,
according to the necessities of her
place and condition. The wonder
was that from a pale and sickly infant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the child grew as by a charm,
under the eye of the dwarf, into a
blooming girl, whose quiet and
simple demeanor detracted nothing
from her peculiar loveliness, and
made her habits of industry the
more admirable. There was, then,
one being in the world whom the
dwarf undoubtedly loved, and by
whom he was loved in return.</p>

<h3>NEW PUBLICATIONS.</h3>

<div class="hanging">

<p><span class="smcap">The True and the False Infallibility
of the Popes, etc.</span> By the late Bishop
Fessler. Translated by Father St.
John, of the Edgbaston Oratory. New
York: The Catholic Publication Society.
1875.</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Fessler was Bishop of St. Polten
in Austria, and the Secretary-General of
the Council of the Vatican. He wrote
this pamphlet as a reply to the apostate
Dr. Schulte. It was carefully examined
and approved at Rome, and the author
received a complimentary letter from the
Pope for the good service he had rendered
to the cause of truth. The true
infallibility which the author vindicates
is that infallibility of the Pope in defining
dogmas of Catholic faith and condemning
heresies, which was defined as
a Catholic dogma by the Council of the
Vatican. The false infallibility which he
impugns is the travesty of the true doctrine,
falsely imputed by Schulte and
others to the Catholic Church as her authoritative
teaching expressed in the definition
of the Vatican Council. This
doctrine of infallibility falsely imputed
represents the Pope as claiming inspiration,
power to create new dogmas, infallibility
as a private doctor, as a judge of
particular cases, and as a ruler. Such an
infallibility was not defined by the Council
of the Vatican, has never been asserted
by the popes, is not maintained
by any school of theologians, and is,
moreover, partly in direct contradiction
to the Catholic doctrine, partly manifestly
false, and as for the rest without any
solid or probable foundation. This false
infallibility must, however, be carefully
distinguished from the theological doctrine
which extends the infallibility of
the church and of the Pope as to its
objective scope and limit; beyond the
sphere of pure dogma, or the Catholic
faith, strictly and properly so-called;
over the entire realm of matters virtually,
mediately, or indirectly contained
in, related to, or connected with the body
of doctrine which is formally revealed,
and is either categorically proposed or
capable of being proposed by the church
as of divine and Catholic faith. Bishop
Fessler confines himself to that which
has been defined in express terms by the
council, and must be held as an article
of faith by every Catholic, under pain of
incurring anathema as a heretic. This
definition respects directly the Pope,
speaking as Pope, as being the subject,
of whom the same infallibility is predicated
which is predicated of the Catholic
Church. The object of infallibility is
obliquely defined, and only so far as
necessary to the precise definition of the
subject, which is the Pope speaking <i lang="la">ex
cathedrâ</i>. As to the object, or extension
of infallibility, no specific definition has
been made. The definition is generic
only. That is, it gives in general terms
those matters which are in the genus of
faith and morals, as the object of infallible
teaching. The truths formally revealed
are the basis of all doctrine in
any way respecting faith and morals
which is theological; and they control all
doctrine which is philosophical, concerning
our relations to God and creatures, at
least negatively. Therefore, taken in
its most restricted sense, infallibility in
faith and morals must denote infallibility
in teaching and defining these formally-revealed
truths. So much, then, respecting
the object, is necessarily <i lang="la">de fide</i>, and
is held as such by every theologian and
every instructed Catholic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the further extension of infallibility,
or the specific definition of all the
matters included in the term “de fide et
moribus,” the fathers of the council
postponed their decisions to a later day,
and probably will consider them when
the council is re-assembled. In the
meantime, we have to be guided by the
teaching of the best theologians whose
doctrine is consonant to the practice of
the Holy See. We may refer the curious
reader to Father Knox’s little work,
<cite>When does the Church Speak Infallibly?</cite>
as the safest source of information concerning
this important point. As a matter
of fact, the popes do teach with authority
many truths which are not articles
of faith, and condemn many opinions
which are not heresies. Moreover, they
command the faithful to assent to their
teaching, and frequently punish those
who refuse to do so. It is much more
logical, and much more consonant to
sound theological principles, to believe
that they are infallible in respect to every
matter in which they justly command our
absolute and irrevocable assent, than to
believe that we are bound to render this
obedience to a fallible authority. But
of the obligation in conscience to submit
to all the doctrinal decisions of the Holy
See there is no question. And this obligation
is very distinctly and emphatically
declared by Pius IX., with the concurrence
of the universal episcopate, in the
closing monition of the First Decree of
the Council of the Vatican.</p>

<p>“Since it is not enough to avoid
heretical pravity, unless those errors also
are diligently shunned which more or
less approach it, we admonish all of the
duty of observing also those constitutions
and decrees in which perverse
opinions of this sort, not here expressly
enumerated, are proscribed and prohibited
by this Holy See.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Archbishop of Westminster has
the intellectual and moral as well as the
ecclesiastical primacy in the Catholic
Church of England, and in this controversy
he leads the band of noble champions
of the faith which Mr. Gladstone’s
audacious war-cry has evoked. The illustrious
successor of S. Anselm and S.
Thomas à Becket has a remarkably clear
insight into the fundamental principles
of theology and canon law, an unswerving
logical consistency in deducing their
connections and consequences, a loyal
integrity in his faith and devotion toward
Christ and his Vicar, a lucidity of style
and language, an untiring activity, dauntless
courage, tactical skill, and abundance
of resources in his polemics, which combine
to make him a champion and leader
of the first class in ecclesiastical warfare&mdash;a
very Duguesclin of controversy. In the
present pamphlet he has defined the
issues with more precision, and brought
the main force of Catholic principles more
directly and powerfully into collision
with his adversary’s opposite centre, than
any other of the remarkably able antagonists
of Mr. Gladstone.</p>

<p>We refer our readers to the pamphlet
itself for a knowledge of its line of argument.
We will merely call attention to
a few particular points in it which are
noteworthy. In the first place, we desire
to note the exposition of one very important
truth frequently misapprehended
and misstated. This is, namely, that
the doctrine of Papal Infallibility was
not, before the Council of the Vatican, a
mere opinion of theologians, but the certain
doctrine of the church, proximate
to faith, and only questioned since the
Council of Constance by a small number,
whose opinion was <em>never a probable doctrine,
but only a tolerated error</em>. The archbishop,
moreover, shows briefly but clearly how
this error, whose intrinsic mischief was
practically nullified in pious Gallicans by
their obedience to the Holy See, and the
overpowering weight which the concurrence
of the great body of the bishops
with the Pope always gave to his dogmatic
decrees, was threatening to become
extremely active and dangerous if longer
tolerated; and that the definition of the
Council of the Vatican was therefore not
only opportune and prudent, but necessary.</p>

<p>He shows, moreover, that the violent
and aggressive party which stirred up
the conflict now raging was the party of
faithless men who wore the mask of
Catholic profession, with their political
and anti-Catholic accomplices, whose unsuccessful
<i lang="fr">ruse de guerre</i>, at the time of the
council, was only the preliminary manœuvre
of a systematic war on the church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>The unchanged position of Catholics
since the council, in respect to civil allegiance;
the essential similarity of that
position, doctrinally, with that of all persons
who maintain the supremacy of conscience
and divine law; its greater practical
security for stability of government
and political order over any other position;
the firm basis for temporal sovereignty
and independence which Catholic
doctrine gives to the state; and the
great variation of practical relations between
church and state from their condition
at a former period which altered circumstances
have caused, are clearly
and ably developed. We are pleased to
observe the positions laid down in our
own editorial article on “Religion and
State in our Republic” sustained and confirmed
by the archbishop’s high authority.
Americans must be especially gratified at
the warm eulogium upon Lord Baltimore
and the primitive constitution of
the Maryland colony.</p>

<p>Among the numerous other replies to
Mr. Gladstone, besides those already noticed
in this magazine, the pamphlets
of Bishop Vaughan, Bishop Ullathorne,
and Lord Robert Montagu are especially
remarkable and worthy of perusal. Each
of them has its own peculiar line of argument
and individual excellence, and they
supplement each other.</p>

<p>The want of sympathy with Mr. Gladstone
generally manifested in England
and America, and the respectful interest
shown in the exposition of Catholic principles
by his antagonists, are specially
worthy of remark. We are under great
obligations to Mr. Gladstone for the fine
opportunity he has afforded us of gaining
such a hearing, and he has thus indirectly
and unintentionally done the cause of
Catholic truth a very great service, which
some of our opponents candidly, though
with considerable chagrin, have acknowledged.</p>

<p>Here we have a kind of quasi-Catholic
tale, written by a Protestant. As a story
it has a good deal of stirring incident
and dramatic power, mingled with a fine
spice of humor. The writer shows no
unkind or unfair disposition toward Catholics

too weak even for the most extreme left

<p>In its didactic aspects we consider <cite>The

There is perhaps no peril to which a

Linda Fair, Dan Dishaway, and old Peter

Benson J. Lossing, Poughkeepsie:
Archibald Wilson. 1875.</p>

</div>

<p>He is a bold publisher who sends forth
a poetical venture in these prosaic days,
backed though it be by a partial subscription
list and the favorable reception
of a first edition.</p>

<p>We are reminded in looking over this
volume, as we have often been before in
examining those of the tuneful brethren,
how much the world is indebted to the
church, consciously or otherwise, for its
most refined enjoyments. If “an undevout
astronomer is mad,” how can a
poet’s instincts be otherwise than Catholic?
Were it not for Catholic themes, he
would lack his highest inspiration, as
well as appropriate imagery to illustrate
his thoughts withal. Even that doughty
old iconoclast, John Bunyan&mdash;every inch
a poet, though his lines were not measured&mdash;found
no relief for his pilgrim-hero
till he had looked upon that symbol of
symbols&mdash;the cross.</p>

<p>The author of the present collection
made no permanent profession of literature,
and rarely wrote except when the
impulse was too strong to be resisted.
His impromptu lines were always his best,
the Scottish dialect, in which many of
them are written, adding not a little to
their racy flavor. His verse is characterized
by sweetness, beauty, and strength,
and he is particularly happy when descanting
upon the joys of home, of love and
friendship, and the charms of outward nature.</p>

<p>We are not aware that the author ever
made a study of the claims of the church,
and some passages in his poems give evidence
of much of the traditional prejudice
against her; but we are confident, from
other indications, that his head was too
logical and his heart too large to be shut
up within the narrow limits of Presbyterian
or other sectarian tenets. The final
stanza of “The Close”&mdash;the last he ever
wrote&mdash;is touching and suggestive:</p>

<h3>PIUS IX. AND MR. GLADSTONE’S MISREPRESENTATIONS.</h3>

<p>The recent conduct of the Right
Honorable William Ewart Gladstone
has filled his former friends and admirers
with anger and sorrow, and
the nobler among his enemies with
astonishment and pity. He has
done much to convert the defeat of
the liberal party in Great Britain,
which might have been but temporary,
into absolute rout and lasting
confusion; for its return to power is
impossible as long as the alienation
of the Irish Catholic members of
Parliament continues. The more
generous of Mr. Gladstone’s political
foes cannot but deplore that the
once mighty opponent, whom they
succeeded in driving from office,
has, by his own behavior, fallen into
something very like contempt. His
strictures on the Vatican decrees
and the <cite>Speeches</cite> of Pius IX. possess
little merit in a literary point of
view, being written in the bad style
common to Exeter Hall controversialists,
and being full of inaccuracies,
misrepresentations, and oversights.
They have accordingly received
from the leading critical
journals in Great Britain either
open censure or that faint praise
which is equally damning. The
<cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite> observes that, if
Mr. Gladstone goes on writing in
a similar strain, no one will heed
what he writes. The wild assault
made by him upon Catholics is not
only perceived by others to be
causeless and gratuitous, but is freely
confessed by himself to be uncalled
for and unwarranted. Speaking
of the questions, whether the
Pope claimed temporal jurisdiction
or deposing power, or whether the
church still teaches the doctrine
of persecution, he says in his <cite>Expostulation</cite>
(page 26): “Now, to no
one of these questions could the
answer really be of the smallest immediate
moment to this powerful
and solidly-compacted kingdom.”
Again, in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> article
(page 300), he asserts that the
“burning” question of the deposing
power, “with reference to the possibilities
of life and action, remains
the shadow of a shade!” Why,
then, does Mr. Gladstone apply the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
torch to quicken the flame of the
burning controversy, which he affirms
to be beyond the range of
practical politics? Why does he
summon the “shadow of a shade”
to trouble, terrify, or distress his
fellow-countrymen? Has he forgotten
the history of his country,
which teaches him that these very
questions were among those which
brought innocent men to the block,
and caused multitudes to suffer the
tortures of the rack and the pains
of ignominious death? We read
in Hallam (<cite>Constitutional Hist. of
England</cite>) that one of the earliest
novelties of legislation introduced
by Henry VIII. was the act of Parliament
of 1534, by which “it was
made high treason to deny that ecclesiastical
supremacy of the crown
which, till about two years before,
no one had ever ventured to assert.
Bishop Fisher, almost the only inflexibly
honest churchman of that
age, was beheaded for this denial.”
Sir Thomas More met the same
fate. Burleigh, in a state paper in
which he apologizes for the illegal
employment of torture in Elizabeth’s
reign, includes among the
questions “asked during their torture”
of those “put to the rack,”
the question, “What was their own
opinion as to the pope’s right to
deprive the queen of her crown?”
In those days, then, the mere opinions
of Catholics concerning papal
supremacy were torturing and beheading
questions&mdash;questions of
the rack, the block, and the stake.
Now they are “burning” questions,
in a metaphorical sense, and lead to
wordy strife, polemical bitterness,
and to widening the breach between
two sections of Queen Victoria’s
subjects, which all wise men during
late years have deplored and striven
to lessen, but which Mr. Gladstone
deliberately sets himself to widen.</p>

<p>Into the causes which have provoked
Mr. Gladstone to attack
Catholics and the Pope it is not
necessary to enter. Corrupt or
impure motives are not imputed to
him. Nor is it here intended to
discuss the theological part of the
subject, which has already been exhaustively
dealt with by Dr. John
Henry Newman, Archbishop Manning,
Bishops Ullathorne, Vaughan,
and Clifford, Monsignor Capel,
and others. The aim of the present
writer is to point out the inaccuracies
of Mr. Gladstone in his
<cite>Expostulation</cite> and his <cite>Quarterly
Review</cite> article on the <cite>Speeches</cite> of
Pius IX., to exhibit his general untrustworthiness
in his references
and quotations, and to bring forward
the real instead of the travestied
sentiments of the Pope.</p>

<p>Now, to honest and fair examination
of documents which concern
their faith Catholics have no objection.
On the contrary, they
desire sincerely that Protestants
should read, mark, learn, and inwardly
digest them. Nothing but
good to the Catholic Church can
result from impartial study of such
documents as the Vatican decrees,
the <cite>Encyclical</cite> and <cite>Syllabus</cite> of Pius
IX., to which, in his <cite>Expostulation</cite>,
Mr. Gladstone made such extensive
reference. Catholics give him a
cordial assent when he says: “It is
impossible for persons accepting
those decrees justly to complain
when such documents are subjected
in good faith to a strict examination
as respects their compatibility
with civil right and the obedience
of subjects.” But Catholics
and all upright Protestants must
join in condemning as unjust and
unfair that bad habit common to
controversialists of a certain class,
who aim at temporary victory for
themselves and their party, careless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
of the interests of eternal verity.
There are partisan writers who cite
portions of a document, in the belief
that the mass of readers will have
no knowledge of the entire, and
who take extracts hap-hazard from
secondary sources, without troubling
themselves to search the authentic
or original documents.
Wilful inaccuracy and purposed
misquotations are not, as has already
been stated, to be imputed to
Mr. Gladstone. But it often occurs
that carelessness and prejudice
lead distinguished writers
into errors similar to those produced
by malice, and equally or
more detrimental. It so happens
that Mr. Gladstone, in describing
and quoting the Vatican decrees,
the words of Pius IX., the <cite>Syllabus</cite>
and <cite>Encyclical</cite>, has published statements
so incorrect and so misleading
as to subject the author, were
he less eminent for honor and scrupulous
veracity, to the charge either
of criminal ignorance or of wilful
intention to mislead. For example,
he cites, at pages 32-34 of his <cite>Expostulation</cite>,
the form of the present
Vatican decrees as proof of the
wonderful “change now consummated
in the constitution of the
Latin Church” and of “the present
degradation of its episcopal order.”
He says the present Vatican decrees,
being promulgated in a strain different
from that adopted by the Council
of Trent, are scarcely worthy to
be termed “the decrees of the
Council of the Vatican.” The
Trent canons were, he says, real
canons of a real council, beginning
thus: “Hæc Sacrosancta,” etc.,
“Synodus,” etc., “docet” or “statuit”
or “decernit,” and the like;
and its canons, “as published in
Rome, are <i lang="la">Canones et Decreta Sacrosancti
Œcumenici Concilii Tridentini</i>,
and so forth. But what we have
now to do with is the <i lang="la">Constitutio
Dogmatica Prima de Ecclesiâ Christi
edita in Sessione tertia</i> of the Vatican
Council. It is not a constitution
made by the council, but one promulgated
in the council. And who
is it that legislates and decrees?
It is <i lang="la">Pius Episcopus, servus servorum
Dei</i>; and the seductive plural of
his <i lang="la">docemus et declaramus</i> is simply
the dignified and ceremonious
‘we’ of royal declarations. The
document is dated ‘Pontificatus
nostri Anno XXV.,’ and the humble
share of the assembled episcopate
in the transaction is represented by
<i lang="la">sacro approbante concilio</i>.” Mr. Gladstone,
stating that the Trent canons
are published as <i lang="la">Canones et Decreta
Sac. Œcum. Concilii Tridentini</i>, and
particularizing in a foot-note the
place of publication as “Romæ: in
Collegio urbano de Propaganda
Fide, 1833,” leads his readers
wrongfully to infer that there exists
no similar publication of the Vatican
decrees. However, the very
first complete edition of the Vatican
decrees, printed especially for
distribution to the fathers of the
council, bears this title: <cite>Acta et
Decreta Sacrosancti Œcumenici Concilii
Vaticani in Quatuor Prioribus
Sessionibus&mdash;Romæ ex Typographia
Vaticana</cite>, 1872. What Mr. Gladstone
appears to have quoted are
the small tracts, containing portions
of the decrees, for general use, one
of which is entitled <cite>Dogmatic Constitution
concerning the Catholic Faith,
Published in the Third Session</cite>, while
another is entitled <cite>The First Dogmatic
Constitution of the Church of
Christ, Published in the Fourth Session</cite>.
Mr. Gladstone has not scrupled
to take one of these tracts as his
text-book, misstating its very title;
for he quotes it as “edita in sessione
tertia” instead of “quarta,” and
deriving from it, instead of from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the authentic <cite>Acta et Decreta</cite>, his
materials for charging the decrees
with a change of form “amounting
to revolution.” Had the <cite>Acta</cite> in
their complete version been before
him, he could not truthfully have
said “the humble share of the
assembled episcopate in the transaction
is represented by <i lang="la">sacro approbante
concilio</i>”; for he would
have found it distinctly stated, and
apparently as reason for their confirmation
by the Pope, that the
decrees and canons contained in
the constitution were read before,
and approved by, all the fathers of
the council, with two exceptions&mdash;“Decreta
et Canones qui in constitutione
modo lecta continentur,
placuerunt patribus omnibus, duobus
exceptis, Nosque, sacro approbante
concilio, illa et illos, ut lecta
sunt, definimus et apostolica auctoritate
confirmamus.” Why does
Mr. Gladstone call attention to the
date as being “Pontificatus nostri
Anno XXV.”? Is it in order to
show that the Vatican despises the
other mode of computation, or is it
to exhibit his own minute accuracy
in quoting? In either case Mr.
Gladstone was wrong, for the date
in the <cite>Constitutio Dogmatica</cite> before
him was as follows: “Datum
Romæ, etc., Anno Incarnationis
Dominicæ 1870, die 18 Julii. Pontificatus
Nostri, Anno XXV.” And
why should Mr. Gladstone describe
as “seductive” the plural of the
Pope’s “docemus et declaramus,”
and assert that plural form to be
“simply the dignified and ceremonious
‘We’ of royal declarations”?
Did he mean to impute to the use
of the plural number a corrupt intention
to make people believe that
the ‘we’ included the bishops as
well as the Pope? Did he mean
also to impute to the use of the
plural an arrogant affectation of
royal dignity? If such were the
purpose of Mr. Gladstone, it can
only be said that such rhetorical
artifices are unworthy of him and
are not warranted by truth. The
‘we’ is simply the habitual form
of episcopal utterances, employed
even by Protestant prelates in their
official acts. It is evident, moreover,
that the use of the plural
<i lang="la">docemus</i> or <i lang="la">declaramus</i>, and the employment
of the formula <i lang="la">sacro approbante
concilio</i>, denounced by Mr.
Gladstone as innovations, have
ancient precedents in their favor.
The <cite>Acta Synodalia</cite> of the Eleventh
General and Third Lateran Council,
held under Pope Alexander III. in
1179, are thus worded: “Nos …
de concilio fratrum nostrorum et
sacri approbatione concilii … decrevimus”
or “statuimus.” The
same form, with trifling variation,
was employed in 1225 by Innocent
III. in another General Council, the
Fourth Lateran. Mr. Gladstone
thinks “the very gist of the evil we
are dealing with consists in following
(and enforcing) precedents of
the age of Innocent III.,” so that it
may be useless to cite the General
Council of Lyons in 1245, under
Innocent IV., with its decrees published
in the obnoxious strain, “<i lang="la">Innocentius
Episcopus, servus servorum
Dei, etc., sacro præsente concilio ad rei
memoriam sempiternam</i>.” The language
of another General Council at
Lyons, in 1274, under Gregory X.,
“Nos … sacro approbante concilio,
damnamus,” etc., and the
language of the Council of Vienne,
in 1311, under Clement V., “Nos
sacro approbante concilio … damnamus
et reprobamus,” come perhaps
too near the age of Innocent
III. to have weight with Mr. Gladstone.
But he cannot object on
this score to the Fifth Lateran Council,
begun in 1512 under Julius II.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and finished in 1517 under Leo X.
In this General Council, the next
before that of Trent, Pope Leo was
present in person, and by him, just
as by Pius IX., in the Vatican Council,
all the definitions and decrees
were made in the strain which Mr.
Gladstone calls innovating and revolutionary,
namely, in the style,
“Leo Episcopus servus servorum
Dei ad perpetuam rei memoriam,
sacro approbante concilio.” Leo
X. uniformly employed the plural
<i lang="la">statuimus et ordinamus</i> in every
session of that council. Pius IX.
followed the example of Leo X., and
obeyed precedents set him by popes
who presided in person&mdash;not by
legates, as at Trent&mdash;at General
Councils held in the years 1179,
1225, 1244, 1274, 1311, and 1517.
Accordingly, “the change of form
in the present, as compared with
other conciliatory (<i lang="la">sic</i>) decrees,”
turns out on examination to be no
revolution, but, on the contrary, appears
to have in its favor precedents
the earliest of which has seven centuries
of antiquity. And yet to
this alleged change of form, and to
this alone, Mr. Gladstone appealed
in evidence of “the amount of the
wonderful change now consummated
in the constitution of the Latin
Church” and of “the present degradation
of its episcopal order”!</p>

<p>The <cite>Encyclical</cite> and <cite>Syllabus</cite> of 1864
have been treated by Mr. Gladstone
in the same loose, careless, and unfair
way as he treated the Vatican
decrees. He promised, at page 15
of his <cite>Expostulation</cite>, to “state, in the
fewest possible words and with references,
a few propositions, all the
holders of which have been <em>condemned</em>
[the italics are Mr. Gladstone’s]
by the See of Rome during my own
generation, and especially within
the last twelve or fifteen years.
And in order,” so proceeds Mr.
Gladstone, “that I may do nothing
towards importing passion into
what is matter of pure argument, I
will avoid citing any of the fearfully
energetic epithets in which the
condemnations are sometimes clothed.”
The references here given by
Mr. Gladstone are to the Encyclical
letter of Pope Gregory XVI. in
1831&mdash;a date, it may be noticed,
rather more ancient than “the last
twelve or fifteen years”&mdash;and to the
following documents, which at page
16 of his pamphlet are thus detailed:
The Encyclical “of Pope
Pius IX., in 1864”; “Encyclical
of Pius IX., December 8, 1864”;
“Syllabus of March 18, 1861”; and
the “Syllabus of Pope Pius IX.,
March 8, 1861.” Here are apparently
five documents deliberately
referred to, the first an Encyclical
of Gregory XVI.; the second an
Encyclical of Pius IX., in 1864; the
third another Encyclical of Pius
IX., dated December 8, 1864; the
fourth a Syllabus of March 18th,
1861; and the fifth another Syllabus
of the 8th of March, 1861. Yet
these apparently five documents, to
which reference is made by Mr. Gladstone
with so much seeming particularity
and exactitude of dates, are
in reality two documents only, and
have but one date&mdash;namely, the 8th
of December, 1864&mdash;on which day
the <cite>Encyclical</cite>, with the <cite>Syllabus</cite> attached,
was published by Pius IX.
At page 67 of his pamphlet Mr.
Gladstone “cites his originals,” and
curiously enough, by a printer’s
error, assigns the Encyclical of Gregory
XVI. to Gregory XIV. But
he cites from two sources only&mdash;namely,
the <cite>Encyclical</cite> and <cite>Syllabus</cite>
of 1864. That Encyclical contains
a quotation from an Encyclical of
Gregory XVI., which and the <cite>Syllabus</cite>
are positively the only documents
actually cited. By a series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of blunders, all of which cannot be
charged to the printer&mdash;and in a work
which has arrived at the “sixteenth
thousand” edition printers’ errors
are hardly allowable&mdash;the two documents,
with their one date, have
been made to do duty for five documents,
ascribed gravely to as many
different dates!</p>

<p>Moreover, Mr. Gladstone’s assertion
that he will state “a few propositions,
all the holders of which
have been <em>condemned</em> by the Holy
See,” is inaccurate, as far as his extracts
from the <cite>Encyclical</cite> and the
<cite>Syllabus</cite>&mdash;the only documents to
which he appeals&mdash;are concerned;
for in them no “holders” of any
propositions are condemned, nor is
there a single anathema directed
against any individual. The errors
only are censured. Mr. Gladstone
cannot illustrate any one of his
eighteen propositions by a single
epithet which could with truth be
called “fearfully energetic.” As a
matter of fact, there are no epithets
at all attached to any condemnations
in the eighty propositions of
the <cite>Syllabus</cite>. When, therefore, Mr.
Gladstone professes, in order to
do nothing “towards importing passion,”
that he will “avoid citing any
of the fearfully energetic epithets
in which the condemnations are
sometimes clothed,” he plays a rhetorical
trick upon his readers.
In truth, had he quoted the entire
of the <cite>Encyclical</cite> and <cite>Syllabus</cite>, he
would not have been able to make
his hypocritical insinuation that he
might have culled, if he wished, more
damaging extracts. Catholics have
to lament, not that he quoted too
much, but that he quoted too little;
not that he quoted with severe
rigor, but that he quoted with absolute
unfaithfulness. It is justice,
not mercy, which Catholics demand
from him, and which they ask all
the more imperatively because he
has himself laid down the axiom:
“Exactness in stating truth according
to the measure of our intelligence
is an indispensable condition
of justice and of a title to be
heard.”</p>

<p>It was urged by some persons
that Mr. Gladstone gave sufficient
opportunities for correcting the effect
of his inaccuracies by publishing
in an appendix the Latin of
the propositions he professed to
quote. But so glaring is the contrast
between the “propositions”
in English and the same in Latin
that a writer in the <cite>Civiltâ Cattolica</cite>
exclaims in amazement: “Has he
[Mr. Gladstone] misunderstood the
Latin of the quoted texts? Has he
through thoughtlessness travestied
the sense? Or has his good faith
fallen a victim to the disloyalty of
some cunning Old Catholics who
furnished him with these propositions?”
Mr. Gladstone has asserted
that Pius IX. has condemned
“those who maintain the liberty of
the press,” “or the liberty of conscience
and of worship,” “or the liberty
of speech.” On referring to the
Latin original of these the first three
of his eighteen propositions, it is
found that Pius IX. has given no occasion
for such a monstrous assertion.
The Pope has merely condemned
that species of liberty which every
man not a socialist or communist
must from his heart believe worthy
of censure. Gregory XVI. called this
vicious sort of liberty by the name
of <em>delirium</em>, and Pius IX., in his
<cite>Encyclical</cite>, terms it the “liberty of
perdition.” It is a liberty “especially
pernicious (<i lang="la">maxime exitialem</i>)
to the Catholic Church and the salvation
of souls,” and the claim to it
is based on the error “that liberty
of conscience and of worship is the
proper right of every man; that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
ought to be proclaimed and asserted
by law in every well-constituted
society; and that citizens have an
inherent right to liberty of every
kind, not to be restrained by any
authority, ecclesiastical or civil, so
that they may be able, openly and
publicly, to manifest and declare
their opinions, of whatever kind, by
speech, by the press, or by any other
means.” Such is the sort of liberty
which the <cite>Encyclical</cite> condemns,
which is not the general liberty of
the press, or of conscience and worship,
as Mr. Gladstone would have
it, but that sort of liberty which
might be better termed licentiousness&mdash;a
liberty, that is, which knows
no bridle or restraint, whether human
or divine, and which refuses
to be kept in check by any authority,
ecclesiastical or civil&mdash;“omnimodam
libertatem nullâ vel ecclesiasticâ,
vel civili auctoritate coarctandam.”
The <cite>Expostulation</cite> has been
widely circulated among the learned,
and also in a sixpenny edition
among the masses. It is evident
that thousands of persons accustomed
to entertain a high opinion of the
veracity of great men in Mr. Gladstone’s
position will take his statements
upon trust, and never dream
of testing, even had they the requisite
acquaintance with a dead language,
the accuracy of his translations
and quotations. To abuse
the confidence of this section of the
public is a sin severely to be reprobated.</p>

<p>The <cite>Speeches of Pius IX</cite>.&mdash;which,
it would appear, were not read by
Mr. Gladstone until after he wrote
the <cite>Expostulation</cite>&mdash;have been by him
criticised in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>
unmercifully and unfairly. He did
not take into consideration the circumstance
that these speeches are
not elaborate orations, but are merely
the unprepared, unstudied utterances
of a pontiff so aged as to be
termed by the reviewer himself a
“nonagenarian,” borne down with
unparalleled afflictions, weighted
with innumerable cares, and oppressed
with frequent and at times serious
illnesses. The speeches themselves
were not reported <i lang="la">verbatim</i> or
<i lang="la">in extenso</i>. No professional shorthand
writer attended when they
were delivered, and they were not
spoken with a view to their publication.
But every word which
comes from the lips of Pius IX. is
precious to Catholics; and as some
of these speeches were taken down
by various hands and appeared in
various periodicals, it was thought
proper to allow a collection of them
to be formed and published by an
ecclesiastic, Don Pasquale de Franciscis,
who himself took notes of
the greater number of these <cite>Discourses</cite>.
This gentleman is described
by Mr. Gladstone as “an accomplished
professor of flunkyism
in things spiritual,” and one of the
“sycophants” about the Pope who
administer to His Holiness “an
adulation, not only excessive in its
degree, but of a kind which to an
unbiassed mind may seem to border
on profanity.” Mr. Gladstone is
fond of insinuating that his own
mind is “unbiassed” or “dispassionate,”
and that he would by no
means “import passion” into a controversy
where calm reasoning alone
is admissible. But, in point of fact,
as the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite> has pointed
out, he shows himself the bigoted
controversialist instead of the grave
statesman. Forgetting the genius
of the Italian people, and the difference
between the warm and impulsive
natives of the South and the
phlegmatic Anglo-Saxons; forgetting,
also, the literary toadyism of
English writers not many years ago,
and the apparently profane adulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
paid to British sovereigns, he
attacks Don Pasquale for calling
the book of the Pope’s speeches “divine,”
and accuses him of downright
blasphemy. Dr. Newman, in one
of his <cite>Lectures on the Present Position
of Catholics in England</cite>, has
given an humorous account of the
way in which foreigners might be
induced to believe the laws and
constitution of England to be profane
and blasphemous. This he
did by culling out a series of sentences
from Blackstone and others,
such as “the king can do no wrong,”
“the king never dies,” he is “the
vicar of God on earth.” Thus impeccability,
immortality, and omnipotence
may be claimed for the
British monarch! Moreover, the
subjects of James I. called him “the
breath of their nostrils”; he himself,
according to Lord Clarendon, on
one occasion called himself “a
god”; Lord Bacon called him “some
sort of little god”; Alexander Pope
and Addison termed Queen Anne
“a goddess,” the words of the latter
writer being: “Thee, goddess,
thee Britannia’s isle adores.” What
Dr. Newman did in good-humored
irony Mr. Gladstone does in sober
and bitter earnest. He picks out
epithets here and there, tacking on
the expressions of one page to those
of another, and then flings the collected
epithets before his reader as
proof of Don Pasquale’s profanity.
The temperament of Italians in
the present day may or may
not furnish a valid defence, in
respect to good taste, for Don Pasquale.
But it is certain that the
phrases used by the latter, when
taken in their context and interpreted
as any one familiar with
Italian ideas would interpret them,
afford slight basis for the odious
charge of profanity&mdash;a charge which
Mr. Gladstone urges not only by
the means already pointed out, but
by other means still more reprehensible,
namely, by fastening on
Don Pasquale expressions which he
did not employ. Thus, at page 274
of the <cite>Review</cite>, Mr. Gladstone, in
reference to the “sufferings pretended
to be inflicted by the Italian
kingdom upon the so-called
prisoner of the Vatican,” adds,
“Let us see how, and with what
daring misuse of Holy Scripture,
they are illustrated in the authorized
volume before us. ‘He and
his august consort,’ says Don Pasquale,
speaking of the Comte and
Comtesse de Chambord, ‘were profoundly
moved at such great afflictions
which the Lamb of the Vatican
has to endure.’” It seems, in
the first place, rather strained to
term the application of the word
“lamb” to Pius IX., or any other
person, a “daring misuse of Holy
Scripture.” Many a man, when expressing
pious hope under disaster,
exclaims, “The Lord tempers the
wind to the shorn lamb,” using or
misusing, as the case may be, not
the language of Holy Scripture, but
the words of the author of <cite>Tristram
Shandy</cite>, to whose works, we
believe, the epithet “holy” is not
commonly applied. If Pius IX.
had been termed “the lamb of
God,” then indeed Holy Scripture
might have been used or misused;
but the single word “lamb,” even
in the phrase “lamb of the Vatican,”
is no more an allusion, profane
or otherwise, to the Gospels
than it is to the Rev. Laurence
Sterne. In the second place, the
expression, be it proper or improper,
was not used by Don Pasquale.
Turning to volume ii. of the <cite>Discorsi</cite>,
page 545, as Mr. Gladstone
directs us, we find the words were
not employed by Don Pasquale, but
by the writer of an article in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
<cite>Unità Cattolica</cite>! Pages 545 and
546, the pages cited, contain a
notice of the presentation to the
Comte and Comtesse de Chambord
of the first volume of the <cite>Discorsi</cite>;
for the article is dated in 1872, and
the second volume was not printed
until 1873. So that it appears the
naughty word was not only not
used by Don Pasquale, but did not
in reality form part of the “authorized
volume,” being merely found
in a newspaper extract inserted in
an appendix. In this same newspaper
extract the Comtesse de
Chambord is said to have called
the first volume of the <cite>Discorsi</cite> “a
continuation of the Gospels and the
Acts of the Apostles.” This statement
rests on the authority of the
writer in the <cite>Unità Cattolica</cite>, but
is brought up in judgment not only
against Don Pasquale, but against
the Pope himself, who is held by
Mr. Gladstone to be responsible for
everything stated either by Don
Pasquale in his preface or by any
other persons in the appendices to
the <cite>Discorsi</cite>!</p>

<p>Concerning the Pope, Mr. Gladstone,
at page 299 of the <cite>Review</cite>,
thus writes: “Whether advisedly
or not, the Pontiff does not, except
once (vol. i. 204), apply the term
[infallible] to himself, but is in
other places content with alleging
his superiority, as has been shown
above, to an inspired prophet, and
with commending those who come
to hear his words as words proceeding
from Jesus Christ (i.
335).” At page 268 of the <cite>Review</cite>
it is also said that Don Pasquale, in
his preface, p. 17, calls the voice of
Pius IX. “the voice of God,” and
that the Pope is “nature that protests”
and “God that condemns.”
If, however, in order to test the
worth of these assertions of Mr.
Gladstone, we turn to the passages
he has cited, it will be discovered
that Pius IX. did not even once
apply the term infallible to himself;
for he, in the passage cited, applied
it not to himself individually, but
to the infallible judgment (<i lang="it">giudizio
infallibile</i>) in principles of revelation,
as contrasted with the authoritative
right of popes in general.
Nor did Pius IX. assert any “superiority
to an inspired prophet”
by saying (<cite>Review</cite>, p. 276, <cite>Discorsi</cite>,
vol. i. 366): “I have the right to
speak even more than Nathan the
prophet to David the king.” The
right to speak upon a certain occasion
does not surely contain of
necessity an allegation of superiority
nor imply a claim to inspiration!
Nor did Pius IX. commend “those
who came to hear his words as
words proceeding from Jesus
Christ”; for he merely said, in reply
to a deputation: “I answer with
the church; and the church herself
supplies to me the words in the
Gospel for this morning. You are
here, and have put forth your sentiments;
but you desire also to hear
the word of Jesus Christ as it issues
from the mouth of his Vicar.” That
is to say: You shall have for answer
“the word of Jesus Christ”&mdash;meaning
this day’s Gospel&mdash;spoken
by, or as it issues from, or which
proceeds (<i lang="it">che esce</i>) out of, the mouth
of his Vicar. The words, “He is
nature that protests, he is God that
condemns,” are evidently metaphorical
expressions of the editor,
harmless enough; for, as Pius IX.
cannot be both God and nature
literally, the metaphorical application
is apparent to the meanest
comprehension. It is true that
Don Pasquale, in his preface, page
16, ascribes to Pius IX. this language:
“This voice which now
sounds before you is the voice of
Him whom I represent on earth”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
(<i lang="it">la <em class="smcapuc">VOCE</em> di colui che in terra Io rappresento</i>);
but, turning to Don Pasquale’s
reference (vol. i. p. 299) to
verify the quotation, it is found
that the editor made a serious mistake,
by which the entire character
of the passage was altered. The
Pope had just contrasted himself
(the <i lang="la">vox clamantis de Vaticano</i>) with
John the Baptist (the <i lang="la">vox clamantis
in deserto</i>). “Yes,” he adds, “I
may also call myself the Voice; for,
although unworthy, I am yet the
Vicar of Christ, and this voice which
now sounds before you is the voice
of him who in earth represents
him” (<i lang="it">è la voce di colui, che in terra lo
rappresenta</i>). Don Pasquale imprudently
put the word “voce” in capital
letters, changed “lo” into
“Io,” and “rappresenta” into
“rappresento.” The Pope simply
said that his voice, as it cried from
the Vatican, was the voice of the
Vicar of Christ. And in the belief
of all Catholics so it is.</p>

<p>The charge of “truculence” is
brought against the Pope by Mr.
Gladstone. “It is time to turn,” he
says (<cite>Review</cite>, p. 277), “with whatever
reluctance, to the truculent and
wrathful aspect which unhappily
prevails over every other in these
<cite>Discourses</cite>.” The first proof of
this “truculence” is, it seems, the
fact that the “<em>cadres</em>, or at least
the skeletons and relics of the old
papal government over the Roman
states, are elaborately and carefully
maintained.” One would suppose
that these <em>cadres</em> were maintained
with the bloodthirsty intention
of making war on Victor
Emanuel. But Mr. Gladstone does
not say so; nay, he insinuates in a
foot-note that their maintenance is
for a purpose far from truculent.
“We have seen it stated from a
good quarter,” so Mr. Gladstone
writes, “that no less than three
thousand persons, formerly in the
papal employment, now receive
some pension or pittance from the
Vatican. Doubtless they are expected
to be forthcoming on all
occasions of great deputations, as
they may be wanted, like the <em>supers</em>
and dummies at the theatres.” It
appears from the <cite>Discorsi</cite> that the
Pope received in audience deputations
from the persons formerly
in the papal employment on twenty-one
occasions, between September,
1870, and September, 1873. On
fourteen of these occasions the
<i lang="it">impiegati</i> were received on days
when no other deputations attended.
On the other occasions, although
other deputations were received on
the same days, the ex-employees
were never mixed up with other
deputations, but were always placed
in separate rooms for audience.
Mr. Gladstone has not the least
ground for insinuating that these
unfortunate persons, who refused to
take the oath of allegiance to Victor
Emanuel, and thereby forfeited
employment and pay, were ever
called upon like <em>supers</em> or dummies
to make a show at great deputations.
If these ex-employees receive
pay from the Pope, it surely is no
proof of papal “truculence.” But
“none of these,” so asserts Mr.
Gladstone (<cite>Review</cite>, p. 278), “appear
at the Vatican as friends, co-religionists,
as receivers of the Pontiff’s
alms, or in any character
which could be of doubtful interpretation.
They appear as being
actually and at the moment his
subjects and his military and civil
servants respectively, although only
in <i lang="it">disponibilità</i>, or, so to speak, on
furlough; they are headed by the
proper leading functionaries, and
the Pope receives them as persons
come for the purpose of doing
homage to their sovereign.” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
references given for this somewhat
confused statement are pages 88
and 365 of volume i., where the
Pope very naturally speaks of “the
fidelity shown by them to their
sovereign,” and of their “faith,
constancy, and attachment to religion,
to God, and to the Vicar of
Jesus Christ, their sovereign.” It
was in consequence of the introduction
by Victor Emanuel, into
the several government departments
in Rome, of an oath of allegiance
to the head of the state&mdash;an oath
not demanded previously under the
Papal rule&mdash;that these <i lang="it">impiegati</i> resigned
their situations, their consciences
not permitting them to take
the oath. It was no wonder, then, that
Pius IX. should notice their fidelity
to himself. But he makes no assertion
whatever to the effect that these
civil and military servants are merely
on furlough or in <i lang="it">disponibilità</i>.
That they do appear as pensioners
on the bounty of Pius IX. may be
proved, in spite of Mr. Gladstone’s
denial, by reference to the <cite>Discorsi</cite>,
at pages 38, 50, 99, 182, 235, 308,
460, and 472 of volume i. and pages
25, 38, and 122 of volume ii. It
cannot be expected that we should
quote all these passages at length,
but we will quote a few of them.
The ex-civil servants, on 13th July,
1872, approached His Holiness to express
“their sincere devotion and
gratitude for what he had done for
their sustentation and comfort under
most distressing circumstances.”
The police officials, seven days afterwards,
were introduced by Mgr.
Randi; and one of them, the Marquis
Pio Capranica, read an address,
in which the persons whom Mr.
Gladstone calls “the scum of the
earth” (<cite>Review</cite>, p. 278) thank the
Pope for extending to them and
their “families his fatherly munificence.”
On the 27th of December,
1871, the ex-military officials,
through Gen. Kanzler, laid at the
foot of the Pope their protestations
of unalterable fidelity, their prayers
for the prolongation of his life, and
their gratitude for his generosity in
alleviating the distress and misery
of many families of his former
soldiers. But perhaps the “truculence”
of Pius IX. may be discovered,
if not in his compassion and
generosity to his ex-servants, at
least in his admonitions to them to
furbish up their arms and keep
their powder dry. Mr. Gladstone
asserts (<cite>Review</cite>, p. 297) that “blood
and iron” are “in contemplation
at the Vatican.” “No careful
reader of this authoritative book
(the <cite>Speeches</cite>) can doubt that these
are the means by which the great
Christian pastor contemplates and
asks&mdash;ay, asks as one who should
think himself entitled to command&mdash;the
re-establishment of his power
in Rome.” Now, the Pope can
ask or command this “blood and
iron” assistance from none so well
as from his ex-soldiers, and from
the civil and military officials still
loyal to their chief. It happens,
however, that no “careful reader”
of the Pope’s speeches to his former
soldiers or servants can discover a
trace of this “truculent” purpose
of His Holiness. He rarely mentions
a weapon; but when he does,
it is to remind his audience (as at
p. 197, vol. i.) that “we must not
combat with material weapons, but
spiritually&mdash;that is to say, with united
prayers.” He reminds some
young soldiers (vol. i. p. 69) that
“prayer is the terrible weapon for
use specially in the actual grievous
condition of affairs, by which
weapon alone can the complete
triumph of the church and religion
be obtained.” When he would
place before some of his faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
civil servants the example of the
“Hebrews when rebuilding Jerusalem,
who held in one hand the working
tools and in the other the sword
to combat the enemy,” he warns
them to imitation by means of
“prayer on the one side, and constancy
on the other” (vol. i. p.
475). Prayer is the burden of his
advice on all these occasions.
“<i lang="la">Sursum corda!</i> Lift up the thought
and the heart to God, from whom
only we can expect comfort, help,
counsel, or protection now and always”
(vol. ii. p. 25). “They
have imagined,” says the Pontiff to
the Marquis Pio Capranica and other
ex-functionaries of the Police Department
(vol. ii. p. 36), “that we
wish to cause an armed reaction!
To think this is folly, and to assert
it is calumny. I have made known
to all persons that the reaction
which I desire is this: namely, to
have people who can protect youth,
and provide for the good education
of the young in the principles of
faith, morality, honesty, and respect
towards the church and her ministers.
This is the reaction which
now and always I will say is our
desire. As for the rest, God will
do that which he wills. Great
reactions are not in my hands, but
in His upon whom all depends.”
There is one passage cited by Mr.
Gladstone to show that the Pope
would “take the initiative,” if he
could, and lead his troops to battle.
It occurs in a speech addressed to
Gen. Kanzler and the officers of
the late pontifical army, and may
be found in vol. ii. pages 141 and
142. The Pope says at the beginning
of his speech, “You are come,
soldiers of honor, attached to this
Holy See and constant in the exercise
of your duties, to present yourselves
before me; but you come without
arms, proving thereby how sad
are the present times. Oh! would
I also could obey that voice of God
which many ages ago said to a
people, Transform your ploughs and
plough-shares and your instruments
of husbandry into spears and swords
and implements of war; for the
enemies are advancing, and there is
need of many weapons and of many
armed men. Would that God would
to-day repeat those same inspirations
even unto us. But God is
silent, and I, his Vicar, cannot do
aught in distinction from him, and
cannot do aught save keep silence.”
The foregoing paragraph has undoubtedly
a warlike sound, and is
of course quoted by Mr. Gladstone;
but it is immediately followed by
another passage which takes from it
all its force, and which is not quoted
by Mr. Gladstone: “And I
will particularly add that I could
never desire to authorize an augmentation
of arms, because, as Vicar
of the God of Peace, who came on
earth to bring peace to us, I am
bound to sustain all the rights of
peace, which is the fairest gift which
God can give to this earth.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone notices “the
Pope’s wealth of vituperative power,”
and refers to various passages
for illustrations. A string of references
looks convincing, but it has
been already shown how little reliance
can be placed on Mr. Gladstone
in this respect. He who
takes the pains to verify these references
will find Pius IX. has indeed
used hard language, not only towards
the Italian government or
Victor Emanuel, but towards insidious
proselytizers and bad and immoral
teachers, spectacles, and publications.
But is Mr. Gladstone an
unprejudiced judge of the propriety
of the pontifical expressions? The
late British premier thinks favorably
of Victor Emanuel, and imagines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Rome to be much improved by the
entrance of the Italians. He thinks
the Pope “knows nothing except at
second-hand, nothing except as he
is prompted by the blindest partisans.”
But Mr. Gladstone himself
is the infallible authority. He has
sought and produced, of course
from impartial sources, statistics to
show that crime has greatly diminished
since the termination of the
papal <i lang="fr">régime</i>. The Gladstonian statistics,
of course, refute the statements
of the Pope, and also, as it
happens, those of the law officers of
the crown in Italy, one of whom,
Ghiglieri, when lately opening the legal
year with an elaborate speech, enlarged
on the increasing prevalence
of crime in the Roman province
since 1870&mdash;that is, since Rome
became the capital. Every visitor
at Rome since that date knows
that “flower-girls” and other girls
have only since 1870 been permitted
to infest the Corso and theatres,
and that Rome, though not yet as
bad as Paris or London in respect
to ostensible immorality, is rapidly
advancing to equality in vice with
rival capitals. But Mr. Gladstone
is not averse to vice in certain quarters.
He calls the blind Duke of
Sirmoneta “able, venerable, and
highly cultivated,” and contrasts
him (with perfect accuracy, but
rather scandalously) with the other
members of the Roman aristocracy,
who, according to Edmond About,
have not even vice to recommend
them. The Carnival of 1875 in
Rome is itself an illustration of the
progress of vice and of crime in
what Mr. Gladstone calls the “orderly
and national Italian kingdom.”</p>

<p>There is but space left to us to
notice the deposing power, “the
most familiar to Englishmen” of all
the “burning questions.” And the
best way to notice this question is
to set before our readers the <i lang="la">ipsissima
verba</i> of Pius IX. on the subject
(as far as a translation can pretend
to supply them) from the famous
speech to the Academia di Religione
Cattolica on July 20, 1871.
The Pope said:</p>

<p>“But amid the variety of themes
presented to you, one seems to me
at present of great importance, and
this is to repel the attacks by which
they try to falsify the idea of the
Pontifical Infallibility. Among
other errors, that one is more than
all others malicious which would
attribute to it the right to depose
sovereigns and release nations from
the bond of fidelity. This right,
without doubt, was sometimes in
extreme circumstances exercised by
pontiffs; but it has nothing to do
with the Pontifical Infallibility.
Nor is its source the infallibility,
but the pontifical authority. The
exercise, moreover, of this right, in
those ages of faith which respected
in the pope that which he is&mdash;namely,
the Supreme Judge of Christianity&mdash;and
recognized the advantages
of his tribunal in the great contests
of peoples and sovereigns, freely
was extended (aided, also, as a duty,
by the public right and by the common
consent of the nations) to the
gravest interests of states and of
their rulers. But the present conditions
are entirely different from
those, and only malice can confound
things so diverse&mdash;as, for instance,
the infallible judgment concerning
the principles of revelation&mdash;with
the right which the popes exercised
in virtue of their authority when
the common good demanded it. As
for the rest, they know it better
than we, and every one can perceive
the reason why they raise at present
a confusion of ideas so absurd and
bring upon the field hypotheses to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
which no one gives heed. They
beg, that is, every pretext, even the
most frivolous and the furthest from
truth, provided it be suited to give
us annoyance and to excite princes
against the church. Some persons
wished that I should explain and
make more clear the conciliar definition.
This I will not do. It is
clear in itself, and has no need of
further comments and explanations.
Its true sense presents itself easily
and obviously to whoever reads the
decree with a dispassionate mind.”</p>

<p>Doubtless the deposing power is
one of the “rusty tools” which
Rome, according to Mr. Gladstone,
has “refurbished and paraded
anew.” But what man with a dispassionate
mind can read the authentic
version of the words put
by Mr. Gladstone incorrectly before
the public without coming to the
conclusion that the “refurbishing
and parading anew” of the deposing
power is altogether a creation of
Mr. Gladstone’s “brain-power,”
and that Pius IX., so far from showing
a disposition to employ again
“the rusty tool,” actually manifests
an intention to undervalue it and
lay it aside? Some persons would
“refurbish” up the deposing power
by connecting it with infallibility,
and the Pope denounces their
attempt as absurd and malicious.
The abstract right of pontiffs to depose
princes and release subjects
from allegiance is referred by Pius
IX. not to the infallibility which
would give it new lustre, but to the
pontifical authority, which in olden
time was strong and powerful,
but which at present is scarcely recognized
by the kingdoms of the
world. The exercise of this right
is delicately touched upon, in such
a way as to suggest not the least
disposition to resume the right by
putting it in practice. It was indeed
“sometimes, in extreme circumstances”&mdash;<i lang="it">talvolta
in supreme
circostanze</i>&mdash;exercised by popes in
those times when the pontiff was
acknowledged “the Supreme Judge
of Christianity,” and when the Holy
See, by the common consent of nations,
was the tribunal to which appeal
was made in the great contests
of sovereigns and nations.
Then indeed this right was extended
to “the gravest interests of nations
and of rulers”; but now all is
different&mdash;“aflatto diverse.” So far
from “parading anew” the abstract
right, and “furbishing” it up for
present use, the Holy Father indignantly
repudiates the malicious allegation
by declaring that the
right itself was but seldom exercised
in ancient times, and then
only under special conditions such
as are not likely to be found in
modern days. “Hypotheses” may
of course be imagined by those who
wish “to give annoyance and excite
princes against the church.”
But these “hypotheses,” as the
Pope remarks, are not serious. No
one pays heed or attention to them.
They are “ipotesi, alle quali niuno
pensa.” The limits of the obedience
of subjects to sovereigns are
clearly set forth by Pius IX. in his
address to an Austrian deputation
on the 18th of June, 1871. “Submission
and respect to authority
are the principal duties of truly good
subjects. But at the same time I
must remind you,” says the Pope,
“that your obedience and fidelity
have a limit to be observed. Be
faithful to the sovereign whom God
has given to you, and obey the laws
which govern you; but when necessity
calls, let your obedience and
fidelity not advance beyond, but
be arrested at, the steps of the altar.”
You have “duties to the
laws as subjects, and to your consciences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
as Christians.” “Unite
these duties well, and let your
supreme rule be the holy law of
God and his church.” The state
of mind of that man who can find
nothing in the <cite>Speeches of Pius IX.</cite>
save matter for ridicule, sarcasm,
and invective is not to be envied.
It reminds one of the phrase employed
in the consistorial “<i lang="la">processus</i>”
for the appointment of a bishop
to a diocese in which heretics
usurped the churches and impeded
the profession and practice of true
religion: <i lang="la">Illius status potius est deplorandus
quam recensendus</i>&mdash;It is a
condition which is rather to be deplored
than described.</p>

<div class="verse indent1">So tempting, cool, and quiet.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He quaintly eyed the little pool,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And hopt so self-confiding,</div>
<div class="verse">And peek’d around, like boy from school,</div>

<div class="verse">The bath came only to his knees,</div>

<div class="verse">Against his throat the water sprees,</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">It leapt in bubbles, as his crest</div>

<h3>ARE YOU MY WIFE?</h3>

<p class="center">BY THE AUTHOR OF “A SALON IN PARIS BEFORE THE WAR,” “NUMBER THIRTEEN,” “PIUS VI.,” ETC</p>

<h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

<p>“Here you are, you naughty little
maiden, gadding about the
country when I want you to be at
home to talk to me!” exclaimed
Sir Simon, as Franceline burst into
the cottage full of her little adventure.
“Where have you been all
this time?”</p>

<p>“Only to see Miss Merrywig,
and then I came home by the
fields.”</p>

<p>“And was any poor mortal lucky
enough to meet you coming through
the rye?” inquired Sir Simon facetiously.</p>

<p>Franceline didn’t see the point a
bit; but she blushed as if she did,
and Sir Simon was not the man to
let her off.</p>

<p>“Oh! so that’s it, is it? Come,
now, and tell me all about it,” he
said, drawing her to a low seat beside
his arm-chair, the only one in
the establishment, and which his
host always insisted on his taking.
“You must let me into the secret;
it’s very shabby of you to have got
one without consulting me. Who
is he, and where did you meet
him?”</p>

<p>“One is Mr. Charlton,” replied
Franceline naïvely; “but I don’t
know who the other is. I never saw
him before. Tell me who he is,
monsieur?”</p>

<p>“Tell you! Well, upon my
word, you are a pretty flirt! You
don’t even know his name! A
very nice young lady!”</p>

<p>“Is he a Frenchman, monsieur?
I think he must be from the way
he bowed. Is he a friend of yours?
Nobody else knows Frenchmen
here but you. Do tell me who he
is.”</p>

<p>“He’s not a Frenchman,” said
Sir Simon, “and he’ll never forgive
you for mistaking him for one,
I can tell you. If you were a man,
he would run you through the
body for it just as soon as he’d
look at you!”</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu!” cried Franceline,
opening her eyes wide with wonder,
“then I don’t care to know any
more about him. I hope I shall
never see him again.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you shall, though, and
I’ll take care to tell him,” declared
Sir Simon.</p>

<p>“What is it? What is it?” called
out M. de la Bourbonais, looking
up from a letter that he was writing
against time to catch the post.
“What are you both quarrelling
about again?”</p>

<p>“Petit père, monsieur is so unkind
and so disagreeable!”</p>

<p>“And Mlle. Franceline is so
cruel and so inquisitive!”</p>

<p>“He won’t tell me who that
strange gentleman is, petit père.
Canst thou tell me?”</p>

<p>“Oh! ho! I thought we didn’t
care to know!” laughed Sir Simon
with a mischievous look.</p>

<p>“Tell me, petit père!” said
Franceline, ignoring her tormentor’s
taunt; and going up to her father,
she laid her head coaxingly against
his.</p>

<p>He looked at her for a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
with a strange expression, and then
said, half speaking to himself, while
he stroked her hair, “What can
it matter to thee? What is one
strange face more or less to thee
or me?” Then turning to Sir
Simon, who was enjoying the sight
of the young girl’s innocent curiosity,
and perhaps revolving possible
eventualities in his buoyant
mind, the count said, “Who is it,
Harness?”</p>

<p>“How do I know?” retorted his
friend. “A strange gentleman that
bows like a Frenchman is not a
very lucid indication.”</p>

<p>“I met him coming out of your
gate, walking with Mr. Charlton,”
explained Franceline. “He’s taller
than Mr. Charlton&mdash;as tall as you,
monsieur&mdash;and he wore a moustache
like a Frenchman. I never saw any
one like him in England.”</p>

<p>Franceline’s recollections of
France were mostly rather dim,
but, like the memories of childhood,
those that survived were very
vivid.</p>

<p>“If he must be a Frenchman,
I can make nothing out of it,” said
Sir Simon.</p>

<p>“Voyons, Harness,” laughed the
count, “don’t be too unmerciful!
Curiosity in a woman once led to
terrible consequences.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you who he is
In fact, I came here to-day on purpose
to tell you, and to ask when I
could bring him to see you. He’s
the nephew of my old school-chum,
De Winton, a very nice fellow, but
not the least like a Frenchman,
whatever his bow and his moustache
may say to the contrary.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean Clide De Winton,
the poor young fellow who …?”</p>

<p>“Precisely,” replied Sir Simon;
“he’s been a rover on the face of
the earth for the last eight or nine
years. This is the first time I’ve
seen him since I said good-by to
him on the steamer at Marseilles,
and met you on my way back.
He’s been all over the world since
then, I believe. You’ll find he has
plenty to say for himself, and his
French is number one.”</p>

<p>“And the admiral&mdash;is he with
him?” inquired Raymond.</p>

<p>“I’m expecting him down to-morrow.
How long is it since you
saw him?”</p>

<p>“Hé!… let us not count the
years, mon cher! We were all
young then.”</p>

<p>“We’re all young now,” protested
the hearty baronet. “Men of
our time of life never grow old;
it’s only these young ones that can
afford that sort of thing,” nodding
toward Franceline, who, since she
found her Frenchman was no
Frenchman, appeared to have lost
all interest in him, and was busily
tidying her father’s table. “As to
the admiral, he’s younger than ever
he was. By the way, I don’t intend
to let him cut me out with a certain
young lady; so let me see no flirtation
in that quarter. I’ll not stand
it. Do you hear me, Miss Franceline?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the laconic rejoinder,
and she went on fixing some
loose papers in a letter-press.</p>

<p class="break">“Yes, Monsieur le Comte is at
home; but, as monsieur knows, he
never likes to be disturbed at this
hour,” replied Angélique, who was
knitting the family stockings in the
wee summer-house at the end of
the garden.</p>

<p>“Oh! I’ll answer for it he won’t
mind being disturbed this time,”
said Sir Simon. “Tell him it’s his
old friend, the admiral, who wants
to see him.”</p>

<p>Before Angélique had got her
needles under way and risen, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
cry of jubilant welcome sounded
from the closed shutters of the
little room where the count was
hard at work in the dark. “Mon
cher De Vinton! how it rejoices
me to embrace you.” And the
Frenchman was in his friend’s arms
in a minute. “My good Angélique,
this is one of our eldest
friends! Where is mademoiselle?
Fetch her on the instant! Mon
cher De Vinton.”</p>

<p>The four gentlemen&mdash;for Clide
was there&mdash;went laughing and shaking
hands into the house, and
groped their way as best they could
into Raymond’s study. He had
the sensible foreign habit of keeping
the shutters closed to exclude the
heat, and the admiral nearly fell
over a stool in scrambling for a
chair.</p>

<p>“My dear Bourbonais, we’re none
of us bats, and darkness isn’t a help
to the flow of soul,” said Sir Simon;
“so, by your leave, I’ll throw a
little light on the subject.” And
he pushed back the shutter.</p>

<p>Before their eyes had recovered
the blinding shock of the light
coming suddenly on the darkness,
a light foot was pattering down the
stairs, and Franceline glided into
the room. The effect was very
much as if a lily had sprouted up
from the carpet. An involuntary
“God bless my soul!” broke from
the admiral, and Clide started to
his feet. “My daughter, messieurs,”
said M. de la Bourbonais,
with a sudden touch of the courtier
in his manner, as he took her by
the hand, and presented her to
them both. Franceline bowed to
the young man, and held out her
hand to the elder one. The admiral,
with an unwonted impulse of
gallantry, raised it to his lips, and
then held it in both his own, looking
steadily into her face with an open
stare of fatherly admiration. He
had seen many lovely women in his
day, and, if report spoke true, the
brave sailor had been a very fair
judge of the charms of the gentler
sex; but he had never seen anything
the least like this. Perhaps it
was the unexpected contrast of the
picture with the frame that took
him so much by surprise and heightened
the effect; but, whatever it was,
he was completely taken aback, and
stood looking at it speechless and
bewildered.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me that
this wild rose belongs to <em>him</em>?” he
said at last, addressing himself to
Sir Simon, and with an aggressive
nod at Raymond, as if he suspected
him of having pilfered the article
in question, and were prepared to
do battle for the rightful owner.</p>

<p>“He says so,” averred the baronet
cautiously.</p>

<p>“He may say what he likes,”
declared the admiral, “my belief is
that he purloined it out of some
fairy’s garden.”</p>

<p>“And my belief is that you purloined
that!” snubbed Sir Simon.
“You never had as much
poetry in you as would inspire a
fly; had he, Clide?”</p>

<p>Raymond rubbed his spectacles,
and put them on again&mdash;his usual
way of disposing of an awkward
situation, and which just now helped
to conceal the twinkle of innocent
paternal vanity that was dancing
in his gray eyes.</p>

<p>“No, you usedn’t to be much of
a poet when I knew you, De Vinton,”
he said.</p>

<p>“No more he is now,” asserted
the baronet. “What do you say,
Clide?”</p>

<p>“The most prosaic of us may become
poets under a certain pressure
of inspiration,” replied the
young man, with an imperceptible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
movement of his head in the direction
of Franceline, who blushed
under the speech just enough to
justify the admiral’s wild-rose
simile. She drew her hand laughingly
away from his, and then, when
everybody had found a seat, she
pushed her favorite low stool close
to her father’s chair, and sat down
by his knee.</p>

<p>The friends had a great deal to
say to each other, although the
presence of Clide and Sir Simon
prevented their touching on certain
episodes of the past that were
brought vividly to Raymond’s mind
by the presence of one whom he
had not seen since they had taken
place. This kept all painful subjects
in the background; and in
spite of a wistful look in Raymond’s
eyes, as if the sailor’s weather-beaten
face were calling up the
ghost of by-gone days&mdash;joys that
had lived their span and died, and
sorrow that was not dead, but sleeping&mdash;he
kept up the flow of conversation
with great animation. Meanwhile,
the two young people were
pushed rather outside the circle.
Clide, instead of entering on a <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>,
as it was clearly his right and
his duty to do, kept holding on by
the fringe of his uncle’s talk, feigning
to be deeply interested in it,
while all the time he was thinking
of something else, longing to go
and sit by Franceline, and talk to
her. It was not shyness that kept
him back. That infirmity of early
youth had left him, with other outward
signs of boyhood. The features
had lost their boyish expression,
and matured into that of the
man of the world, who had seen life
and observed things by the road
with shrewd eyes and a mind that
had learned to think. Clide had
ripened prematurely within the
last eight years, as men do who
are put to school to a great sorrow.
He and his monitress had not parted
company, but they had grown
used to each other. Sometimes he
reproached himself for this with a
certain bitterness. It seemed like
treason to have forgotten; to have
put his grief aside, railed it off, as
it were, from his life, like a grave
to be visited at stated times, and
kept trimmed with flowers that
were no longer watered with tears.
He accused himself of being too
weak to hold his sorrow, of having
let it go from want of strength to
keep it. Enduring grief, like enduring
love, must have a strong, rich
soil to feed upon. The thing we
mourn, like the thing we love, may
contain in itself all good and beauty
and endless claims upon our constancy;
but we may fail in power
to answer them. The demand may
be too great for the scanty measure
of our supply. It is harder to be
faithful in sorrow than in love.
Clide had realized this, and he
could never think of it without a
pang. Yet he was not to blame.
What he had loved and mourned
was only a mirage, a will-o’-the-wisp
the ideal creation of his own
trusting heart and generous imagination.
He was angry with himself
because the thunderbolt that had
fallen in his Garden of Eden, and
burnt up the leaves of his tree of
life, had not torn it up by the roots
and killed it. Our lives have deeper
roots than we know. Even when
they are torn quite up we sometimes
plant them again, and they
grow afresh, striking their fibres
deeper than before, and bringing
forth richer fruit. But we refuse
to believe this until we have tasted
of the fruit. Clide sat apparently
listening to the cheery, affectionate
talk of his uncle and Raymond; but
he was all the while listening to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
his own thoughts. What was there
in the sight of this ivory-browed,
mystic-looking maiden to call up
so vividly another face so utterly
different from it? Why did he hear
the sea booming its dirge like a
reproach to him from that lonely
grave at St. Valery, as if he were
wronging or wounding the dead by
resting his eyes on Franceline?
Yet, in spite of the reproach, he
could not keep them averted. Her
father sometimes called her <i lang="fr">Clair
de lune</i>. It was not an inappropriate
name; there was something of the
cold, pure light of the moon in her
transparent pallor, and in the shadows
of her eyes under the long,
black lashes that lent them such a
soft fascination. Clide thought so,
as he watched her; cold as the
face might be, it was stirring his
pulse and making his heart beat as
he never thought to feel them stir
and beat again.</p>

<p>“Are ces messieurs going to stay
for supper?” said Angélique, putting
her nut-brown face in at the
door. “Because, if they are, I must
know in time to get ready.”</p>

<p>“Why, Angélique, I never knew
you want more than five minutes to
prepare the best <i lang="fr">omelette soufflée</i> I
ever get anywhere out of the Palais
Royal!” said Sir Simon.</p>

<p>“Ah! monsieur mocks me,” said
Angélique, who was so elated
by this public recognition of her
omelet talent that, if Sir Simon
was not embraced by the nut-brown
face on the spot, it was one
of those hair-breadth escapes that
our lives are full of, and we never
give thanks for because we never
know of them. “Persuade De
Vinton and our young friend here to
stop and test it, then!” exclaimed
M. de la Bourbonais, holding out
both hands to the admiral in his
genial, impulsive way. “The garden
is our <i lang="fr">salle-à-manger</i> in this hot
weather, so there is plenty of room.”
There was something irresistible in
the simplicity and cordiality of
the offer, and the admiral was about
to say he would be delighted, when
Sir Simon put in his veto: “No, no,
not this evening. You must come
and dine with us, Bourbonais; I
want you up at the house this evening.
But the invitation will keep.
We’ll not let Angélique off her <i lang="fr">omelette
soufflée</i>; we’ll come and attack
it to-morrow, if these rovers don’t
bolt, as they threaten to do.”</p>

<p>And so the conference was broken
up, and Raymond accompanied
his guests to the garden-gate, promising
to follow them in half an
hour.</p>

<p>It was a rare event for M. de la
Bourbonais to dine at Dullerton
Court; he disliked accepting its
grand-seignior hospitality, and whenever
he consented it was understood
there should be nobody to meet
him. “I have grown as unsocial
as a bear from long habit, mon
cher,” he would be sure to say
every time Sir Simon bore down on
him with an invitation. “I shall
turn into a mollusk by-and-by.
How completely we are the creatures
of habit!” To which Sir
Simon would invariably reply with
his Johnsonian maxim: “You should
struggle against that sort of thing,
Bourbonais, and overcome it”; and
Raymond would smile, and agree
with him. He was too gentle and
too thoroughbred to taunt his friend
with not following it himself, which
he might have done with bitter
truth. Sir Simon was the slave of
habits and of weaknesses that it was
far more necessary to struggle against
than Raymond’s harmless little
foibles. There are some men who
spend one-half of their lives in
cheating others, and the other half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
in trying to cheat themselves. Sir
Simon Harness was one of these.
Cheating is perhaps a hard word to
apply to his efforts to keep up a
delusion which had grown so entirely
his master that he could
scarcely see where the substance
ended and where the shadow began.
Yet his whole life at present was a
cheat. He had the reputation of
being the largest land-owner and
the wealthiest man in that end of
the county, and he was, in reality,
one of the poorest. The grand aim
of his existence was to live up to
this false appearance, and prevent
the truth from coming out. It
would be a difficult and useless undertaking
to examine how far he was
originally to blame for the state of
active falsehood into which he and
his circumstances had fallen. There
is no doubt that his father was to
blame in the first instance. He
had been a very splendid old gentleman,
Sir Alexander Harness, and
had lived splendidly and died
heavily in debt, leaving the estate
considerably mortgaged. He had
not been more than twenty years
dead at the time I speak of, so that
his son, in coming into possession,
found himself saddled with the
paternal debts, and with the confirmed
extravagant habits of a lifetime.
This made the sacrifices
which the payment of those debts
necessitated seem a matter of simple
impossibility to him. The only
thing to be done was to let the
Court for a term of years, send away
the troops of misnamed servants
that encumbered the place, sell
off the stud, and betake himself
to the Continent and economize.
Thus he would have paid off his
encumbrances, and come back independent
and easy in his mind.
But, unluckily, strong measures of
this sort did not lie at all in Sir
Simon’s way. He talked about
going abroad, and had some indefinite
notion of “pulling in.” He did
run off to Paris and other continental
places very frequently; but as he
travelled with a courier and a valet,
and with all the expenses inseparable
from those adjuncts, the excursions
did not contribute much towards
the desired result. Things
went on at the Court in the old
way; the same staff of servants was
kept up; the same number of parasites
who, under pretence of payment
for some small debt, had lived
in the Court for years, until they
came to consider they had a vested
life-interest in the property, were
allowed to hang on. The new master
of Dullerton was loath to do
such a shabby thing as to turn them
out; and they were sure to die off
after a while. Then there was the
stud, which Sir Alexander had been
so proud of. It had been a terrible
expense to set it up, but, being up, it
was a pity to let it down; when
things were going, they had a way
of keeping themselves going. There
had always been open house at the
Court from time immemorial. In
the shooting season people had
come down, as a matter of course,
and enjoyed the jovial hospitalities
of the old squire ever since Dullerton
had belonged to him. While his
son was there he could not possibly
break through these old habits;
they were as sacred as the family
traditions. By-and-by, when he saw
his way to shutting up the place
and going abroad, it might be managed.
Meanwhile, the old debts
were accumulating, and new ones
were growing, and Sir Simon was
beginning less than ever to see his
way to setting things right. If that
tough old Lady Rebecca Harness,
his step-mother, would but take
herself to a better world, and leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
him that fifty thousand pounds that
reverted to him at her demise, it
would be a great mercy. But Lady
Rebecca evidently was in no hurry
to try whether there was any pleasanter
place than this best of all possible
worlds, and, in spite of her
seventy years, was as hale as a woman
of forty. This was a trying
state of things to the light-tempered,
open-handed baronet; but the
greatest trial to him was the fear in
which he lived of being found out.
He was at heart an upright man,
and it was his pride that men looked
up to him as one whose character
and principles were, like Cæsar’s
wife, above suspicion. He had
lived up to this reputation so far;
but he was conscious of a growing
fear that with the increase of difficulties
there was stealing on him a
lessening of the fine moral sense
that had hitherto supported him
under many temptations. His embarrassments
were creating a sort of
mental fog around him; he was beginning
to wonder whether his theories
about honesty were quite where
they used to be, and whether he
was not getting on the other side
of the border-line between conscience
and expediency. Outside
it was still all fair; he was the most
popular man in the county, a capital
landlord&mdash;in fact, everybody’s
friend but his own. The only person,
except the family lawyer, who
was allowed to look at the other
side of the picture, was M. de la
Bourbonais. Sir Simon was too
sympathetic himself not to feel the
need of sympathy. He must occasionally
complain of his hard fate to
some one, so he complained to Raymond.
But Raymond, while he
gave him his sincerest sympathy,
was very far from realizing the extent
of the troubles that called it
forth. The baronet bemoaned himself
in a vague manner, denouncing
people and things in a general sweep
every now and then; but between
times he was as gay and contented
as a man could be, and Raymond
knew far too little of the ways
of the world and of human nature
to reconcile these conflicting evidences,
and deduce from them the
facts they represented. He could
not apprehend the anomaly of a
sane man, and a man of honor, behaving
like a lunatic and a swindler;
spending treble his income in
vanity and superfluity, and for no
better purpose than an empty bubble
of popularity and vexation of
spirit. Of late, however, he had
once or twice gained a glimpse into
the mystery, and it had given him
a sharp pang, which Sir Simon no
sooner perceived than he hastened
to dispel by treating his lamentations
as mere irritability of temper,
assuring Raymond they meant nothing.
But there was still an uneasy
feeling in the latter’s mind.
It was chiefly painful to him for
Sir Simon’s sake, but it made him
a little uncomfortable on his own
account. With Raymond’s punctilious
notions of integrity, the man
who connived at wrong-doing, or
in the remotest way participated in
it, was only a degree less culpable
than the actual wrong-doer; and if
Sir Simon had come to the point of
being hard up for a fifty-pound note
to meet a pressing bill, it was very
unprincipled of him to be giving
dinners with Johannisberg and Tokay
at twenty shillings a bottle, and
very wrong of his friends to aid and
abet him in such extravagance. One
day Sir Simon came in with a clouded
brow to unburden himself about
a fellow who had the insolence to
write for the seventh time, demanding
the payment of his “little bill,”
and, after a vehement tirade, wound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
up by asking Raymond to go back
and dine with him. “We’ll have
up a bottle of your favorite Château
Margaux, and drink confusion to the
duns and the speedy extermination
of the race,” said the baronet.
“Come and cheer a fellow up, old
boy; nothing clears away the blue
devils like discussing one’s worries
over a good glass of claret.” Raymond
fought off, first on the old
plea that he hated going out, etc.;
but, finding this would not do, he
confessed the truth. He hinted delicately
that he did not feel justified
in allowing his friend to go to any
expense on his account. The innocence
and infantine simplicity of
this avowal sent Sir Simon into
such a hearty fit of laughter that
Raymond felt rather ashamed of
himself, and began to apologize
profusely for being so stupid and
having misunderstood, etc., and declared
he would go and drink the
bottle of Château Margaux all to
himself. But after this Sir Simon
was more reticent about his embarrassments;
and as things went on at
the Court in the old, smooth, magnificent
way, M. de la Bourbonais began
to think it was all right, and that his
friend’s want of money must have
been a mere temporary inconvenience.
In fact, he began to doubt
this evening whether it was not all
a dream of his that Sir Simon had
ever talked of being “hard up.”
When he entered the noble dining-room
and looked around him, it
was difficult to believe otherwise.
Massive silver and costly crystal
sparkled and flashed under a
shower of light from the antique
branching chandelier; wax-lights
clustered on the walls amidst solemn
Rembrandt heads, and fascinating
Reynoldses, and wild Salvator
Rosas, and tender Claudes, and
sunny Canalettos. It was not in
nature that the owner of all this
wealth and splendor should know
what it was to be in want of money.
Sir Simon, moreover, was in his element;
and it would have puzzled
a spectator more versed than Raymond
in the complex mechanism
of the human heart to believe that
the brilliant host who was doing
the honors of his house so delightfully
had a canker gnawing at his
vitals. He rattled away with the
buoyant spirits of five-and-twenty;
he was brimful of anecdote, and
bright with repartee. He drew
every one else out. This was what
made him so irresistibly charming
in society; it was not only that he
shone himself, but he had a knack
of making other people shine. He
made the admiral tell stories of his
seafaring life, he drew out Clide
about Afghanistan, and spirited M.
de la Bourbonais into a quarrel
with him about the dates of the
Pyramids; never flagging for a moment,
never prosing, but vaulting
lightly from one subject to another,
and all the while leaving his guests
under the impression that they were
entertaining him rather than he
them, and that he was admiring
them a vast deal more than he admired
himself. A most delightful
host Sir Simon was.</p>

<p>“Nothing cheers a man up like
the sight of an old friend! Eh, De
Winton?” he exclaimed, falling
back in his chair, with a thumb
thrust into each waistcoat pocket,
and his feet stretched out to their
full length under the mahogany,
the picture of luxury, hospitality,
and content.</p>

<p>“Much you know about it!”
grunted the admiral, filling his glass&mdash;“a
man that never wanted to be
cheered up in his life!”</p>

<p>Sir Simon threw back his head
and laughed. It was wine to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to be rated such a good fellow by his
old college chum.</p>

<p>They kept it up till eleven o’clock,
puffing their cigars on the terrace,
where the soft summer moon was
shining beautifully on the fawns
playing under the silver spray of
the fountain.</p>

<p>“I’ll walk home with you, Raymond,”
said Sir Simon when the
chime of the stable-clock reminded
the count that it was time for him
to go.</p>

<p>It was about ten minutes’ walk to
The Lilies through the park; but as
the night was so lovely, the baronet
proposed they should take the longer
way by the road, and see the
river by moonlight. They walked
on for a while without speaking.
Raymond was enjoying the beauty
of the scene, the gold of the fields
and the green of the meadows, all
shining alike in silver, the identity
of the trees and flowers merged in
uniform radiancy; he fancied his
companion was admiring it too, until
the latter broke the spell by an unexpected
exclamation: “What an
infernal bore money is, my dear fellow!
I mean the want of it.”</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu!” was the count’s
astonished comment. And as Sir
Simon said nothing more, he looked
up at him uneasily: “I thought
things had come all right again,
mon cher?”</p>

<p>“They never were right; that’s
the deuce of it. If I’d found them
right, I wouldn’t have been such an
ass as to put them wrong. A man
needn’t be a saint or a philosopher
to keep within an income of ten
thousand pounds a year; the difficulty
is to live up to the name of it
when you haven’t got more than
the fifth in reality. A man’s life
isn’t worth a year’s purchase with
the worry these rascally fellows give
one&mdash;a set of low scoundrels that
would suck your vitals with all the
pleasure in life, just because you
happen to be a gentleman. Here’s
that architect fellow that ran up
those stables last year, blustering
and blowing about his miserable
twelve hundred pounds as if it was
the price of a cathedral! I told
the fellow he’d have to wait for his
money, and of course he was all
readiness and civility, anything to
secure the job; and it’s no sooner
done than he’s down on me with a
hue-and-cry. He must have his
money, forsooth, or else he’ll be
driven to the painful necessity of
applying through his man of business.
A fellow of his kind threatening
me with his man of business!
The impertinence of his having a
man of business at all! But I dare
say it’s a piece of braggadocio; he
thinks he’ll frighten the money out
of me by giving himself airs and
talking big. I’ll see the scoundrel
further! There’s no standing the
impudence of that class nowadays.
Something must be done to check
it. It’s a disgrace to the country to
see the way they’re taking the upper
hand and riding rough-shod
over us. And mark my words if
the country doesn’t live to regret
it! We landed proprietors are the
bulwark of the state; and if they
let us be sent to the wall, they had
better look to their own moorings.
Mark my words, Bourbonais!”</p>

<p>Bourbonais was marking his
words, but he was too bewildered
to make any sense out of
them. “I agree with you, mon
cher, the lower orders are becoming
the upper ones in many ways; but
what does that prove?”</p>

<p>“Prove! It proves there’s something
rotten in the state of Denmark!”
retorted Sir Simon.</p>

<p>“But how does that affect the
case in question? I mean what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
has it to do with this architect’s
bill?”</p>

<p>“It has this to do with it: that
if this fellow’s father had attempted
the same impertinence with my
father, he’d have been sent to the
right-about; whereas he may insult
me, not only with impunity, but
with effect! That’s what it has to
do with it. Public opinion has
changed sides since my father lived
like a gentleman, and snapped his
fingers at these parasites that live
by sucking our blood.”</p>

<p>Raymond knew that when Sir
Simon got on the subject of the
“lower” orders and their iniquities,
there was nothing for it but to give
him his head, and wait patiently
till he pulled up of his own accord.
When at last the baronet drew
breath, and was willing to listen,
he brought him back to the point,
and asked what he meant to do
about the twelve-hundred-pound
bill. Did he see his way to paying
it? Sir Simon did not. It was a
curious fact that he never saw his
way to paying a bill until he had
contracted it, and until his vision had
been sharpened by some disagreeable
process like the present, which
forced him to face the alternative
of paying or doing worse. These
new stables had been a necessary
expense, it is true, and he was very
forcible in reiterating the fact to
Raymond; but the latter had a
provoking way of reverting to first
principles, as he called it, and, after
hearing his friend’s logical demonstration
as to the absolute necessity
which had compelled him to build&mdash;the
valuable horses that were being
damaged by the damp of the old
stables; the impossibility of keeping
up a hunting stud without proper
accommodations for horses and
men; the economy that the outlay
was sure to be in the long run, the
saving of doctor’s bills, etc.; the
“vet.” was never out of the house
while the horses were lodged in
the old stables&mdash;M. de la Bourbonais
said: “But, mon cher, why
need you keep a hunting stud, why
keep horses at all, if you can’t afford
it?”</p>

<p>This was a question that never
crossed Sir Simon’s mind, or, if it
did, it was dismissed with such
a peremptory snub that it never
presented itself again. It was
peculiarly irritating to have it
thrust on him now, at a moment
when he wanted some soothing
advice to cheer him up. The idea,
put into words and spoken aloud
by another, was, however, not as
easily ignored as when it passed
silently through his own mind; it
must be answered, if only by shutting
the door in its face.</p>

<p>“My dear Raymond,” said the
baronet in his affectionate, patronizing
way, “you don’t quite understand
the matter; you look at it
too much from a Frenchman’s
point of view. You don’t make allowance
for the different conditions
of society in this country. There
are certain things, you see, that a
man must do in England; society
exacts it of him. A gentleman must
live like a gentleman, or else he
can’t hold his own. It isn’t a matter
of choice.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me it is, though,”
returned Raymond. “He may
choose between his duty to his conscience
and his duty to society.”</p>

<p>“You can’t separate them, my
dear fellow; it’s not to be done in
this country. But that’s shifting
the question too wide of the mark,”
observed Sir Simon, who began to
feel it was being driven rather too
close. “The thing is, how am I to
raise the wind to quiet this architect?
It is too late to discuss the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
wisdom of building the stables;
they are built, and they must be paid
for.”</p>

<p>“Sell those two hunters that you
paid five hundred pounds apiece
for; that will go a long way towards
it,” suggested the count.</p>

<p>The proposition was self-evident,
but that did not make it the more
palatable to Sir Simon. He muttered
something about not seeing
his way to a purchaser just then.
Raymond, however, pressed the
matter warmly, and urged him to
set about finding one without delay.
He brought forward a variety of arguments
to back up this advice, and
to prove to his friend that not only
common sense and justice demanded
that he should follow it, but that,
from a selfish point of view, it was
the best thing he could do. “Trust
me,” he cried, “the peace of mind it
will bring you will largely compensate
for the sacrifice.” Sacrifice!
It sounded like a mockery on Raymond
de la Bourbonais’ lips to apply
the word to the sale of a couple
of animals for the payment of a foolish
debt; but Raymond, whatever
Sir Simon might say to the contrary,
made large allowance for their
relative positions, and was very far
from any thought of irony when he
called it a sacrifice.</p>

<p>“You’re right; you’re always
right, Raymond,” said the baronet,
leaning his arm heavily on the
count’s shoulder, and imperceptibly
guiding him closer to the river,
that was flowing on like a message
of peace in the solemn, star-lit silence.
“I’d be a happier man if I
could take life as you do, if I were
more like you.”</p>

<p>“And had to black your own
boots?” Raymond laughed gently.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t mind a rap blacking
my boots, if nobody saw me.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that’s just it! But when
people are reduced to black their
own boots, they’re sure to be
seen. The thing is to do it, and
not care who sees us.”</p>

<p>“That’s the rub,” said Sir Simon;
and then they walked on without
speaking for a while, listening to a
nightingale that woke up in a willow-tree
and broke the silence with
a short, bright cadence, ending in
a trill that made the very shadows
vibrate on the water. There is a
strange unworldliness in moonlight.
The cold stars, tingling silently in
the deep blue peace so far above
us, have a voice that rebukes the
strife of our petty passions more
forcibly than the wisest sermon.
The cares and anxieties of our lives
pale into the flimsy shadows that
they are, when we look at them in
the glory of illuminated midnight
heavens. What sheer folly it all
was, this terror of what the world
would say of him if he sold his hunters!
Sir Simon felt he could laugh
at the world’s surprise, ay, or at its
contempt, if it had met him there
and then by the river’s side, while
the stars were shining down upon
him.</p>

<p>“Simon,” said M. de la Bourbonais,
stopping as they came within
a few steps of The Lilies, “I am
going to ask you for a proof of
friendship.” He scarcely ever called
the baronet by his name, and
Sir Simon felt that, whatever the
proof in question was, it was stirring
Raymond’s heart very deeply
to ask it.</p>

<p>“I thought we had got beyond
<em>asking</em> each other anything of that
sort; if I wanted a service from
you, I should simply tell you so,”
replied the baronet.</p>

<p>“You are right. That is just
what I feel about it. Well, what I
want to say is this: I have a hundred
pounds laid by. I don’t want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
it at present; there is no knowing
when I may want it, so I will draw
it to-morrow and take it to you.”
Raymond made his little announcement
very simply, but there was a
tremor in his voice. Sir Simon
hardly knew what to say. It was
impossible to accept, and impossible
to refuse.</p>

<p>“It’s rather a good joke, my
offering to lend you money!” said
Raymond, laughing and walking on
as if he noticed nothing. “But
you know the story of the lion and
the mouse.”</p>

<p>“Raymond, you’re a richer man
than I am,” said Sir Simon; “a
far happier one,” he added in his
own mind.</p>

<p>“Then you’ll take the hundred
pounds?”</p>

<p>“Yes; that is to say, no. I can’t
say positively at this moment; we’ll
talk it over to-morrow. You’ll
come up early, and we’ll talk it
over. You see, I may not want it
after all. If I get the full value
of Nero and Rosebud, I shouldn’t
want it.”</p>

<p>“But you may not find a purchaser
at once, and a hundred
pounds would keep this man quiet
till you do,” suggested Raymond.</p>

<p>“My dear old boy!” said the
baronet, grasping his hand&mdash;they
were at the gate now&mdash;“I ought to
be ashamed to own it; but the fact is,
Roxham&mdash;you know Lord Roxham
in the next county?&mdash;offered me a
thousand pounds for Rosebud only
two days ago. I’ll write to him to-morrow
and accept it. I dare say
he’d be glad to take the two.”</p>

<p>“Oh! how you unload my heart!
Good-night, mon cher ami. A demain!”
said Raymond.</p>

<p>On his way home Sir Simon looked
stern realities in the face, and
came to the determination that a
change must be made; that it was
not possible to get on as he was,
keeping up a huge establishment,
and entertaining like a man of ten
thousand a year, and getting deeper
and deeper into debt every day.
Raymond was right. Common
sense and justice were the best
advisers, and it was better to obey
their counsels voluntarily while
there was yet time than wait till it
was too late, and he was driven to
extremities. This architect’s bill
was a mere drop in the ocean; but
it is a drop that every now and
then makes the flood run over, and
compels us to do something to stem
the torrent. As Sir Simon turned
it all in his mind in the presence
of the stars, he felt very
brave about the necessary measures
of reform. After all, what did
it signify what the world said of
him? Would the world that criticised
him, perhaps voted him a
fool for selling his hunters, help
him when the day of reckoning
came? What was it all but emptiness
and vanity of vanities? He
realized this truth, as he sauntered
home through the park, and stood
looking down over the landscape
sleeping under the deep blue dome.
Where might he and his amusements
and perplexities be to-morrow&mdash;that
dim to-morrow, that
lies so near to each of us, poor
shadows that we are, our life a
speck between two eternities? Sir
Simon let himself in by a door on
the terrace, and then, instead of
going straight to his room, went
into the library, and wrote a short
note to Lord Roxham. It was
safer to do it now than wait till
morning. The morning was a
dangerous time with Sir Simon for
resolves like the present. It was
ever to him a mystery of hope, the
awakening of the world, the setting
right and cheering up of all things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
by the natural law of resurrection.</p>

<p>The admiral and Clide had planned
to leave next day; but the weather
was so glorious and the host
was so genial that it required no
great pressing to make them alter
their plans and consent to remain
a few days longer.</p>

<p>“You know we are due at Bourbonais’
this evening,” said Sir Simon.
“The old lady will never forgive
me if I disappoint her of
cooking that omelet for you.”</p>

<p>So it was agreed that they would
sup at The Lilies, and M. de la
Bourbonais was requested to convey
the message to Angélique
when, according to appointment,
he came up early to the Court.
He had no opportunity of talking it
over with Sir Simon; the admiral
and Clide were there, and other
visitors dropped in and engaged
his attention. The baronet, however,
contrived to set him quite at
rest; the grasp of his hand, and
the smile with which he greeted his
friend, said plainer than words:
“Cheer up, we’re all right again!”
He was in high spirits, welcoming
everybody, and looking as cheerful
as if he did not know what a
dun meant. He fully intended to
whisper to Raymond that he had
written about the horses to Lord
Roxham; but he was not able to
do it, owing to their being so surrounded.</p>

<p>“Do you ride much, Monsieur le
Comte?” said Clide, coming to sit
by Raymond, who, he observed,
stood rather aloof from the people
who were chatting together on common
topics.</p>

<p>“No,” said Raymond; “I prefer
walking, which is fortunate, as I
don’t possess a horse.”</p>

<p>“If you cared for it, that wouldn’t
be an impediment, I fancy” said
the young man. “Sir Simon would
be only too grateful to you for
exercising one of his. He has a
capital stud. I’ve been looking at
it this morning. He’s a first-rate
judge of horse-flesh.”</p>

<p>“That is the basis of an Englishman’s
education, is it not?” said
the count playfully.</p>

<p>“Which accounts, perhaps, for the
defects of the superstructure,” replied
Clide, laughing. “It is rather
a hard hit at us, Monsieur le
Comte; but I’m afraid we deserve
it. You have a good deal to put
up with from us one way or another,
I dare say, to say nothing of
our climate.”</p>

<p>“That is a subject that I never
venture to touch on,” said Raymond,
with affected solemnity. “I
found out long ago that his climate
was a very sore point with an Englishman,
and that he takes any disrespect
to it as a personal offence.”</p>

<p>“A part of our general conceit,”
observed Clide good-humoredly.
“I’ve been so long out of it that I
almost forget its vices, and only
remember its virtues.”</p>

<p>“What are they?” inquired Raymond.</p>

<p>“Well, I count it a virtue in a
wet day to hold out the hope to
you of seeing it clear up at any
moment; whereas, in countries
that are blessed with a good climate,
once the day sets in wet, you
know your doom; there’s nothing
to hope for till to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“There is something in that, I
grant you,” replied Raymond
thoughtfully; “but the argument
works both ways. If the day sets in
fine here, you never know what it
may do before an hour. In fact, it
proves, what I have long ago made
up my mind to, that there is no
climate in England&mdash;only weather.
Just now it is redeeming itself; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
never saw a lovelier day in France.
Shall we come out of doors and enjoy
it?”</p>

<p>They stepped out on to the terrace,
and turned from the flowery
parterre, with its fountain flashing
in the sunlight, into a shady avenue
of lime-trees.</p>

<p>Clide felt very little interest in
Raymond’s private opinion of the
climate. He wanted to make him
talk of himself, as a preliminary to
talk of his daughter; and, as usual
when we want to lead up to a subject,
he could hit on nothing but
the most irrelevant commonplaces.
Chance finally came to his rescue in
the shape of a stunted palm-tree that
was obtruding its parched leaves
through the broken window of a
neglected orangery. Sir Simon
had had a hobby about growing
oranges at the Court, and had given
it up, like so many other hobbies,
after a while, and the orangery,
that had cost so much money for a
time, was standing forlorn and half-empty
near the flower-garden, a
trophy of its owner’s fickle purpose
and extravagance.</p>

<p>“Poor little abortion!” exclaimed
the count, pointing to the starved
palm-tree, “it did not take
kindly to its exile.”</p>

<p>“Exile is a barren soil to most
of us,” said Clide. “We generally
prove a failure in it.”</p>

<p>“I suppose because we are a failure
when we come to it,” replied
Raymond. “We seldom try exile
until life has failed to us at home.”
He looked up with a quick smile as
he said this, and Clide answered
him with a glance of intelligent and
respectful sympathy. As the two
men looked into each other’s face,
it was as if some intangible barrier
were melting away, and confidence
were suddenly being established in
its place.</p>

<p>Clide had never pronounced his
wife’s name since the day he had
let his head drop on the admiral’s
breast, and abandoned himself to
the passion of his boyish grief. It
was as if the recollection of his
marriage and its miserable ending
had died and been buried with
Isabel. The admiral had often
wondered how one so young could
be so self-contained, wrapping himself
in such an impenetrable reserve.
The old sailor was not given to
speculating on mental phenomena
as a rule; but he had given this
particular one many a five minutes’
cogitation, and the conclusion he
arrived at was that either Clide
had taken the matter less to heart
than he imagined, and so felt no
need of the solace of talking over
his loss, or that the sense of humiliation
which attached to the
memory of Isabel was so painful
to him, as a man and a De Winton,
that he was unwilling to recur to it.
There may have been something of
this latter feeling mixed up with
the other impalpable causes that
kept him mute; but to-day, as he
paced up and down under the fragrant
shade of the lime-trees with
M. de la Bourbonais, a sudden
desire sprang up in him to speak of
the past, and evoke the sympathy
of this man, who had suffered, perhaps,
more deeply than himself.
They were silent for a few minutes,
but a subtle, magnetic sympathy
was at work between them.</p>

<p>“I too have had my little glimpse
of paradise, only to be turned out,
like so many others, to finish my
pilgrimage alone,” said Raymond
abruptly.</p>

<p>“No, not alone,” retorted Clide;
“you have a daughter, who must be
a great delight to you.”</p>

<p>“Ah! you are right. I was ungrateful
to say alone; but you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
understand that that other solitude
can never be filled up. That is to
say,” he added, looking up with a
brightening expression in his keen
eyes, that sparkled under projecting
brows, made more prominent by
bushy black eyebrows, “not at my
age; at yours it is different. When
sorrow comes to a man at the close
of his half-century, it is too late to
plant again; he cannot begin life
anew. There is no future for him
but courage and resignation. But
at your age everything is a beginning.
While we are young, no matter
how dark the sky is, the future
looks bright; to-morrow is always
full of hope and glad surprises
when we are young.”</p>

<p>“I don’t feel as if I were young,”
said Clide; “it seems to me as if
I had outlived my youth. You
know there are experiences that
do the work of years quite as well
as time; that make us old prematurely?”</p>

<p>“I know it, I can believe it,”
replied Raymond; “but nevertheless
the spring of youth remains. It
only wants the help of time to heal
its wounds and restore its power of
working and enjoying.”</p>

<p>The young man shook his head
incredulously.</p>

<p>“You don’t believe it yet; but
you will find it out by-and-by,”
insisted Raymond; “that is, if you
wish it and strive for it. We are
most of us asleep until sorrow
wakes us up and stings us into
activity; then we begin to live really,
and to work.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m afraid I have been
awakened to no purpose,” remarked
Clide rather bitterly. “I certainly
have not begun to work.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps unawares you have all
this time been preparing yourself
for work&mdash;for some appointed task
that you would never have been fitted
for without the experiences of
the last years.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps you are right,”
assented his companion. They
walked on through the flower-beds
for a few moments without speaking.
Then Raymond broke the
silence: “Why should you go away
again, wandering about the Continent,
and indulging in morbid
memories, when you have such a
noble mission before you at home!
Youth, intelligence, and a splendid
patrimony&mdash;what a field of usefulness
lies before you! Is it permitted
to leave any field untilled when
the laborers are so few?” The same
thought had occurred to Clide during
the last twenty-four hours with
a persistency that he was not very
earnest in repelling. “Indulging
in morbid memories!” That was
what his step-mother was now constantly
reproaching him with. He
resented it from her; but Raymond
did not excite his resentment. It
was too much as if a father were expostulating
with his son. The paternal
tone of the remonstrance called,
moreover, for fuller confidence
on his part, and, yielding to the fascination
of the sympathy that was
drawing him on and on, he resolved
there and then to give it. He told
M. de la Bourbonais the history of
his life from the beginning: his
loveless childhood, his boyhood,
starved of all spiritual food, his
youth’s wild passion, the loneliness
of his later years, and his present
dissatisfied longings. He laid bare
all that inner life he had never unfolded
to any human being before.
It was a touching and desolate picture
enough, and one that called
out Raymond’s tenderest interest
and compassion. He listened to
the story with that breathless, undivided
attention that made Sir Simon
so delight in him as a listener;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
answering by an inarticulate exclamation
now and then, interrupting
here and there to put in a question
that showed how closely he was following
every turn in the narrative,
and how fully and completely he
understood and entered into every
phase of feeling the speaker described.
When Clide had finished, he
seemed to understand himself better
than he had ever done before.
Every question of the listener seemed
to throw a new and stronger
light on what he was telling him;
it was like a key opening unexpected
mysteries in the past and in his
own mind, showing him how from
the very starting his whole theory
of life had been a mistake. Life
was now for the first time put under
the laws of truth, and through that
transparent medium every act and
circumstance showed altogether differently;
hidden meanings came out
of what had hitherto been mere
blots, what he had called accidents
and mischances; every detail had
a form and color of its own, and fitted
into the whole like the broken
pieces of a puzzle. He had been
learning and training all the time
while he fancied he was only suffering;
he had unawares been drinking
in that moral strength that is
only to be gained in wrestling with
sorrow. The revelation was startling;
but Clide frankly acknowledged
it, and in so doing felt that he
was tacitly committing himself to
the new line of conduct which must
logically follow on this admission,
if it was worth anything. There
must be an end of sentimental regrets
and morbid despondings. He
must, as Raymond said, begin to
practise the lesson he had paid so
dear to learn; he must begin to live
and to work; he must, by faithfulness
and courage in the future, atone
for the folly and selfishness of the
past.</p>

<p>It may appear strange, perhaps
incredible, that a mere passing contact
with a stranger should have so
suddenly revealed all this to Clide,
stirred him so deeply, and impelled
him to a definite resolution that
was to change the whole current of
his life. But which of us cannot
trace to some apparently chance
meeting, some word heedlessly uttered,
and perhaps not intended for
us, a momentous epoch in our lives?
We can never tell who may be the
bearer of the burning message to
us, nor in what unknown tongue it
may be spoken. All that matters
to us is that we hearken to it, and
follow where the messenger beckons.
M. de la Bourbonais had no
idea that he was performing this
office to Clide; nor did anything
that he actually said justify the
young man in looking upon him in
the light of a herald or an interpreter.
It was something rather in the
man himself that did it; a voice
that spoke unconsciously in his
voice. There is a power in truth
and simplicity more potent than
any eloquence; and truth and simplicity
radiated from Raymond
like an atmosphere. His presence
had a light in it that impressed you
insensibly with the right view of
things, and dissipated worldliness
and selfishness and morbid delusions
as the sun clears away the
mists. Perhaps along with this immediate
influence there was another
one which acted unawares on Clide,
adding to the pressure of Raymond’s
pleading the softer incentive
of an ideal yet possible reward.</p>

<h3>DRAPER’S CONFLICT BETWEEN RELIGION AND SCIENCE.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></h3>

<p>The author of this volume became
known to the public of New
York a little over twenty years ago
through a hand-book of chemistry,
written at a time when that science
was emerging into its present
maturity. Almost simultaneously
appeared from his pen a treatise
on <cite>Human Physiology</cite>, when it likewise
was running a swift race to its
splendid proportions of to-day, impelled
by the labors of Claude Bernard,
Beaumont, and Bichat. Those
works were received at the time with
much favor by American teachers
of both named sciences as being
clear and succinct compilations of
the labors of European investigators,
while containing some original
observations of undoubted scientific
merit. Thus, the perception
of the influence of endosmosis and
exosmosis on the functions of respiration
and circulation, and the reference
of pitch, quality, and intensity
of sound to different portions of
the anatomical structure of the ear,
constitute a valid claim, on Draper’s
part, as a contributor to modern
physiology. As a chemist,
though painstaking and observant,
he failed to keep pace with European
researches, and so his book has
been superseded in our schools and
colleges by later and more thorough
productions. Indeed, it may
be said that his work on physiology
likewise is rapidly becoming obsolete,
its popularity having ceded
place to the excellent treatises
of Dalton and Austin Flint, Jr.</p>

<p>Had he in time recognized his
exclusive fitness for experimental
chemistry and physiology, his name
might rank to-day with those of
Liebig and Lehmann; but some
disturbing idiosyncrasy or malevolent
influence inspired him with the
belief that he was destined for higher
pursuits, and he burned to emulate
Gibbon and Buckle. On the
heels of the late civil war, accordingly,
appeared from his ambitious
pen a book with the pretentious
title of <cite>History of the American Civil
War</cite>, in which he strove to prove
that the agencies which precipitated
that sad quarrel dated back a
thousand years; that thermal bands
having separated the North from
the South, the two sections could
not agree; that the conflict is not
yet over, and will be ended only
when both sides recognize the East
as the home of science, and make
their salam to the rising sun. We
speak not in jest; the book, we believe,
is still extant, and may be
consulted by the curious in such
matters. Though the <cite>History of
the American Civil War</cite> did not
meet with flattering success, the new
apostle of Islamism was not discouraged.
No more trustworthy as a
historian than Macaulay, he lacked
the <em>verve</em> and eloquence of that
brilliant essayist, and his bantling
fell into an early decline.</p>

<p>But there still was Buckle, in another
department of intellectual activity,
whom it might be vouchsafed
him to outsoar; and so, Dædalus-like,
having readjusted his wings
by means of a fresh supply of wax,
he took a swoop into the <cite>Intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Development of Europe</cite> with precisely
the results which befell his
classical prototype. Here indeed
was a wide field for the display
of that peculiar philosophy of his
which anathematizes the <cite>Pentateuch</cite>
and the pope, and apotheosizes the
locomotive and the loom. Accordingly,
we find the <cite>Development</cite>
to be a bitter attack on the church
and all ecclesiastical institutions,
with alternate rhapsodical praises
of material progress and scientific
discoveries.</p>

<p>In the view taken by Dr. Draper
the Papacy defeated the kindly intents
of the mild-mannered Mahomet;
but with the death of Pio
Nono or some immediate successor
the pleasant doctrines of Averroës
and Buddha will reassert themselves,
and we shall all finally be
absorbed in the great mundane soul.
As we have said, in alluding to the
<cite>History of the American Civil War</cite>,
these are not mere idle words;
they carry their black and white
attestation in every page of the
work referred to.</p>

<p>But we must hasten to the volume
under review. It is entitled <cite>History
of the Conflict between Religion
and Science</cite>. The title of the book
is indeed the fittest key to its purpose.
It predicates this conflict on
the first page; it assumes it from
the start, and, instead of proving
its existence, interprets statements
and misstatements by the light of
that assumption. Of this the reader
is made painfully aware from
the very outset, and his sense of
logic and fair play is constantly
shocked by the distortion of very
many historical facts and the truthful
presentment of a few in support
of what is a plain and palpable assumption.
The book is therefore
a farrago of falsehoods, with an occasional
ray of truth, all held together
by the slender thread of a
spurious philosophy.</p>

<p>In the preface the author promises
to be impartial, and scarcely has
he proceeded eight short pages in
his little volume before a cynical
and sneering spirit betrays him into
errors which a Catholic Sunday-school
child would blush to commit.
On page 8 he says: “Immaculate
Conceptions and celestial
descents were so currently received
in those days that whoever had
greatly distinguished himself in the
affairs of men was thought to be of
supernatural lineage.” And a little
further on: “The Egyptian disciples
of Plato would have looked
with anger on those who rejected
the legend that Perictione, the mother
of that great philosopher, a
pure virgin, had suffered an immaculate
conception.” This is but a
forestalment of the wrath held in
store by our author for the dogma
proclaimed in 1854, a derisive comparison
of it with the gross myths
of the superstitious Greeks. And
yet how conspicuous does not the
allusion render his ignorance of the
Catholic doctrine! For evidently
the reference to a pure virgin subjected
to an immaculate conception
through the agency of a God reveals
Draper’s belief that the Catholic
dogma of the Immaculate Conception
consists in the conception
of Christ in the womb of the Virgin
Mary without human intervention.
Surely some malign agent had warped
his judgment when he assumed
to expound Catholic doctrine; had</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Made the eye blind, and closed the passages</div>
<div class="verse">Through which the ear converses with the heart.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But this is not the only point
concerning which we would refer
persons curious about Catholic doctrines
to Dr. Draper, and those
who would like to become acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
with Catholic tenets never promulgated
by any council from Nice
to the Vatican. On two occasions,
speaking of Papal Infallibility, he
distinctly avers that it is the same
as omniscience! On page 352 he
says: “Notwithstanding his infallibility,
which implies omniscience,
His Holiness did not foresee the
issue of the Franco-Prussian war.”
And again on page 361: “He cannot
claim infallibility in religious affairs,
and decline it in scientific. Infallibility
embraces all things. If it holds
good for theology, it necessarily
holds good for science.” Here is
Catholic doctrine <i lang="fr">à la</i> Draper!
Presumptuous reader, be not deluded
by the belief that the Vatican
Council expressly confines infallibility
to purely doctrinal matters; it
could not have done so! Does
not Dr. Draper as explicitly affirm
that the dogma of infallibility implies
omniscience? His individual
experience no doubt had much to
do with his extension of the term;
for, knowing himself to be a good
chemist and physiologist, he doubted
not that by the same title he
was a sound philosopher and a
keen-eyed observer of events. If
it holds good in chemistry and physiology,
it necessarily holds good in
philosophy and history. It is a renewal
of the old belief of the Stoics,
as expounded by Horace, who says
that the wise man is a capital shoemaker
and barber, alone handsome
and a king. But these are blemishes
which assume even the appearance
of bright spots shining out by
contrast with the deeper darkness
which they stud.</p>

<p>The radical error of the book is
twofold. It first confounds with
the Catholic Church a great number
of singular subjects to which
that universal predicate cannot be
applied, loosely and vaguely referring
to this incongruous chimera
a great number of acts which cannot
be imputed to the church at all
in any proper sense. It next makes
the mistake of applying the standard
of estimation which is justly applicable
only to the present time to
epochs long past and in many respects
diverse from it. For instance,
the personal acts of prelates are referred
to the church considered as
an infallible tribunal. Only an ignoramus
in theology needs to be informed
that the infallible church is
the body of the episcopate teaching
or defining in union with the head,
or the head of the episcopate teaching
and defining, as the principal organ
of the body, that which is explicitly
or implicitly contained in
the revealed deposit of faith. Administration
of affairs, decisions of
particular cases, private opinions
and personal acts, even official acts
which are not within the category
above stated, do not pertain to the
sphere of infallibility; therefore
when Dr. Draper charges against
the church acts which are worthy
of censure, or which are by him so
represented, and we detect in the
case the absence of some one condition
requisite to involve the church
in the sense stated, we retort that
he either knows not what he says
or is guilty of wilful misrepresentation.
Yet his book is an unbroken
tissue of such charges. And not
only are those charges improperly
alleged, but they are for the most
part substantially false.</p>

<p>At a time, for instance, when the
placid influence of Christianity had
not supplanted in men’s hearts the
fierce passions which ages of paganism
had nurtured there, a band of
infuriated monks murdered and
tore to pieces the celebrated Hypatia,
in resentment of some real or
fancied affront offered to S. Cyril<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
The crime was indeed unpardonable,
and perhaps S. Cyril was remiss
in its punishment; but we
might as well lay to the charge of
the New York Academy of Medicine
the revolting deeds perpetrated
by individual members of the medical
profession, as hold the church
accountable for this crime. Both
organizations have repeatedly expressed
their abhorrence of what
morality condemns, and it is only
fair that the one as well as the other
be judged by its authoritative teachings
and practices. Yet Dr. Draper
draws from his quiver on this
occasion the sharpest of arrows to
bury in the bosom of that church
which could stain her escutcheon
by this wanton attack on philosophy.
“Hypatia and Cyril! Philosophy
and bigotry! They cannot exist
together.” Do not the melodramatic
surroundings with which Draper’s
graphic pen invests the murder of
this woman readily suggest an episode
in the history of a certain
knight of rueful mien when he
charged a flock of sheep, believing
that he saw before him “the wealthy
inhabitants of Mancha crowned
with golden ears of corn; the ancient
offspring of the Goths cased in iron;
those who wanton in the lazy current
of Pisverga, those who feed their
numerous flocks in the ample plains
where the Guadiana pursues its
wandering course&mdash;in a word, half
a world in arms”? He charges, and
behold seven innocent sheep fall
victims to his prowess. Flushed
with this victory, and covetous of
fresh laurels, our author whets his
blade for another thrust at that most
odious of doctrines&mdash;Papal Infallibility.
The management of the attack
will serve as a specimen of Dr.
Draper’s mode of critical warfare;
it will show how neatly he puts forward
assertion for proof, and in
what a spirit of calm and dignified
philosophy he concludes the case
against the church.</p>

<p>A compatriot of his, who had
changed the homely name of Morgan
for the more resonant one of
Pelagius, feeling that the confines
of the little isle which gave him
birth were too narrow for a soul
swelling with polemics, hied to Rome,
where his theological fervor was
speedily cooled by Pope Innocent
I. Pelagius denied the Catholic
doctrine of grace, asserting the sufficiency
of nature to work out salvation.
S. Augustine pointed out
the errors of Pelagius and of his associate,
Celestius, which were accordingly
condemned by Pope Innocent.
If we accept Dr. Draper
as an authority in ecclesiastical history,
a much-vexed question connected
with this very intricate affair
is readily solved, and we are
taught to understand how indiscreet
were the fathers of the Vatican
Council in decreeing the infallibility
of the pope. He says: “It happened
that at this moment Innocent
died, and his successor, Zosimus,
annulled his judgment and declared
the opinions of Pelagius to be
orthodox. These contradictory
decisions are still often referred to
by the opponents of Papal Infallibility.”</p>

<p>Now, so far from this being the
case, Zosimus, after a considerable
time of charitable waiting, to give
Celestius an opportunity of reconsidering
his errors and being reconciled
to the church, formally repeated
the condemnation pronounced
by his predecessor, and effectually
stamped out Pelagianism as a
formidable heresy. But since our
weight and calibre are so much less
than Dr. Draper’s as not to allow
our assertion to pass for proof, we
will dwell a moment on the historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
details of the controversy. Before
the death of Innocent, Celestius
had entered a protest against his
accuser, Paulinus, on the ground of
misrepresentation, but did not follow
up his protest by personally
appearing at Rome. The succession
of the kind-hearted Zosimus
and the absence of Paulinus appeared
to him a favorable opportunity
for doing this, and he accordingly
wrote to Zosimus for permission to
present himself. Though the pope
was engrossed at the time by the
weighty cares of the universal
church, his heart yearned to bring
back the repentant Celestius to the
fold of Christ, and he accorded to
him a most patient hearing. Only
a fragment of Celestius’ confession
remains, but we have the testimony
of three unsuspected witnesses, because
determined anti-Pelagians,
concerning the part taken in the
matter by the pope. S. Augustine
says: “The merciful pontiff, seeing
at first Celestius carried away
by the heat of passion and presumption,
hoped to win him over by
kindness, and forbore to fasten more
firmly the bands placed on him by
Innocent. He allowed him two
months for deliberation.” Elsewhere
S. Augustine says (<cite>Epist.
Paulin.</cite>, const. 693, <cite>Labbé</cite>, t. 2) that
Celestius replied to the interrogatories
of the pope in these terms:
“I condemn in accordance with
the sentence of your predecessor,
Innocent of blessed memory.”
Marius Mercator, who lived at the
time of these occurrences, says that
Celestius made the fairest promises
and returned the most satisfactory
answers, so that the pope was greatly
prepossessed in his favor (<cite>Labbé</cite>,
t. 2, coll. 1512). Zosimus at length
saw through the devices of the
wily Celestius, who, like all dangerous
heretics, desired to maintain
his errors while retaining communion
with the church, and, in a letter
written to the bishops of Africa,
formally reiterated against Pelagius
and his adherents the condemnation
of the African Council. Only fragments
of the letter remain, but we
know that thereafter some of the
most violent Pelagians submitted to
the Holy See. With what imposing
dignity Dr. Draper waves aside
these facts, and coolly asserts that
Zosimus annulled the judgment of
his predecessor, and declared the
opinions of Pelagius to be orthodox!
But this is only a sample
of similar flagrant misstatements
in which the book abounds. For
even immediately after, referring to
Tertullian’s eloquent statement of
the principles of Christianity, he
says that it is marked by a complete
absence of the doctrines of original
sin, total depravity, predestination,
grace, and atonement, and that
therefore these doctrines had not
been broached up to this time.
Certainly not all of them, for the
church does not teach the doctrine
of total depravity; but the statement,
being of the nature of a
negative proof, possesses no value,
and only shows on how slender a
peg our author is ready to hang
a damaging assertion against the
church. Having thus triumphantly
demonstrated that Tertullian is not
the author of the doctrine of the
fall of man, he recklessly lays it at
the door of the illustrious Bishop
of Hippo. He says: “It is to S.
Augustine, a Carthaginian, that we
are indebted for the precision of
our views on these important
points.” We wonder did Dr. Draper
ever read these words of S. Paul to
the Romans: “Wherefore as by
one man sin entered into this world
and by sin death: and so death
passed upon all men, in whom all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
have sinned” (Epist. Rom. v. 12).
Yet S. Paul lived before Tertullian
or S. Augustine. Draper next sententiously
adds: “The doctrine declared
to be orthodox by ecclesiastical
authority is overthrown by
the unquestionable discoveries of
modern science. Long before a human
being had appeared upon the
earth, millions of individuals&mdash;nay,
more, thousands of species, and even
genera&mdash;had died; those which remain
with us are an insignificant
fraction of the vast hosts that have
passed away.” Admirably reasoned!
A million or more megatheria
and megalosauri floundered for a
while in the marshes of an infant
world, and died; therefore Adam was
not the first man to die, for through
him death did not enter into the
world. Had S. Paul anticipated
the honor of a dissection at the
hands of so eminent a wielder of
the scalpel, he no doubt would
have stated in his Epistle that when
he spoke of death entering into the
world through the sin of one man,
he meant, not death to frogs and
snakes, or bats and mice, but death
to human beings alone. He would
thus have helped Dr. Draper to the
avoidance of one exegetical error
at least. Another assertion of illimitable
reaches rapidly follows:
“Astronomy, geology, geography,
anthropology, chronology, and indeed
all the various departments
of human knowledge, were made to
conform to the Book of Genesis”;
that is to say, ecclesiastical authority
prohibits us from seeking elsewhere
than in the pages of Holy
Writ such knowledge as is contained
in Gray’s <cite>Anatomy</cite> or Draper’s
<cite>Chemistry</cite> and <cite>Physiology</cite>. Where
are your <i lang="fr">pièces justificatives</i> for this
monstrous assertion, Dr. Draper?
Did not the church, in the heyday
of her temporal power, warn Galileo
not to invoke the authority of the
Scriptures in support of his doctrine
for the reason that they were not
intended to serve as a guide in
purely scientific matters? And
here indeed is the true key to the
conflict between that philosopher
and the church. Has not the same
sentiment, moreover, been explicitly
affirmed by every commentator
from S. Augustine himself down to
Maldonatus and Cornelius à Lapide,
when considering chapter x. verse 13
of the Book of Josue? Not a single
document, extant or lost, can be referred
to as justifying Draper’s extraordinary
assertion that the Book
of Genesis, “in a philosophical
point of view, became the grand
authority of patristic science.” Of
course it is readily perceived that
the term patristic science, as used
by Dr. Draper, is not the science
commonly known as patrology, but
natural science, as understood and
taught by the fathers. Chief among
those whose officious intermeddling
in scientific matters excites the
spleen of Dr. Draper is, as before
stated, S. Augustine, Bishop of Hippo.
“No one,” he says, “did more
than this father to bring science and
religion into antagonism; it was
mainly he who diverted the Bible
from its true office, a guide to purity
of life, and placed it in the perilous
position of being the arbiter
of human knowledge, an audacious
tyranny over the mind of man.”
The rash dogmatism of these words
scarcely consists with the spirit
Draper arrogates to himself&mdash;the
spirit of calm impartiality. So far
from having striven to make Scripture
the arbiter of science, S. Augustine
studied to bring both into
harmony, and, with this end in view,
put the most liberal interpretation
on those passages of Holy Writ
which might conflict with, as yet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
unmade scientific discoveries. For
this reason he hints at the possibility
of the work of creation extending
over indefinite periods of time, as
may, he says, be maintained consistently
with the meaning of the
Syro-Chaldaic word which stands
indifferently for day and indefinite
duration. The saint’s chief anxiety
is to uphold the integrity of the
Book of Genesis against the numerous
attacks of pagan philosophers
and paganizing Christians. The
necessity of doing this was paramount
at the time, for the Jews and
their doctrines were exceedingly
obnoxious to Christian and Gentile;
and since the church recognized
the divine inspiration of the
Hebrew Scriptures, the task of vindicating
their genuineness devolved
on her theologians. But Dr.
Draper overlooks this essential
fact, and places S. Augustine in the
totally false light of wantonly belittling
science by making it square
with the letter of the Bible. But
it is not as a censor alone of S. Augustine’s
opinions that Dr. Draper
means to figure; he follows him
into the domain of dogmatic theology,
and, having there erected a
tribunal, cites him to its bar. He
quotes at length the African bishop’s
views on the fundamental
dogmas of the Trinity and creation,
having modestly substituted Dr.
Pusey’s translation for his own.
The saint expresses his awe and
reverence in face of the wondrous
power and incomprehensible works
of the Creator, and Dr. Draper
calls him rhetorical and rhapsodical.
No wonder. The mind becomes
subdued to the shape in which it
works; and since the vigorous years
of Dr. Draper’s life were spent in
the laboratory, investigating secondary
causes and the properties of
matter, it is not to be supposed that
he can enter at once into close
sympathy with souls which have
fed on spiritual truths.</p>

<div class="verse">“What’s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the crowding errors of the
book warn us to hasten forward.</p>

<p>Having consigned S. Augustine
to never-ending oblivion, our untiring
athlete of the pen eloquently
sketches step by step the progressive
paganization of Christianity.
The first thing to be done, he says,
was to restore the worship of Isis
by substituting for that <i lang="la">numen</i> the
Blessed Virgin Mary. This substitution
was accomplished by the
Council of Ephesus, which declared
Mary to be the Mother of God,
and condemned the contradicting
proposition of Nestorius. Is it
proper to treat this <i lang="fr">niaiserie</i> with
irony or indignation? We will do
neither, but will respectfully refer
Dr. Draper either to Rohrbacher’s
<cite>History of the Church</cite>, or Orsini’s
<cite>Devotion to the Blessed Virgin</cite>, to
convince him of the priority of this
devotion to the times of S. Cyril
and Nestorius. The matter is too
elementary and well known to justify
us in occupying more space
with its consideration. Therefore,
passing over frivolous charges of
this sort, let us seize the underlying
facts in this alleged paganization
of Christianity. The church
does not teach the doctrine of complete
spiritual blindness, and is
willing to admit on the part of
pagans the knowledge of many religious
truths in the natural order.
Prominent among these is a belief
in the existence of God, the immortality
of the soul, and a system
of rewards and punishments in the
future life. The propositions of
De Lamennais, refusing to pure
reason the power of establishing
these truths, were formally condemned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
by Gregory XVI. In addition,
it is part of theological
teaching that certain portions of
the primitive revelation made to the
patriarchs flowed down through
succeeding generations, corrupted,
it is true, and sadly disfigured, yet
substantially identical, and tinged
the various systems of belief in
vogue among the nations of the
earth. It is almost unnecessary to
point out the numberless analogies
which exist between the Hebrew
doctrines and the myths of Grecian
and Roman polytheism. The unity
of God was universally symbolized
by the admission of a supreme
being, to whom the other deities
were subject. The fall of man, a
flooded earth and a rescued ark
find their fitting counterparts in the
traditions of most races. Here,
then, we find one source of possible
agreement between Christianity
and the pagan system without resorting
to Dr. Draper’s ingenious
process of gradual paganization.
If, before the Christian revelation,
human reason could have partially
lifted the veil which hides another
life, and if a defiled current of tradition
could have borne on its bosom
fragments of a primitive revelation,
surely it is not necessary
to suppose a compromise between
Christianity and paganism by virtue
of which the former finds itself
in accord on certain points with
the latter. But a still stronger
reason for the alleged resemblances
and analogies between the two systems
may be found in the common
nature of those who accepted them.
There is no sentiment in the human
heart more potent than veneration,
especially as its objects ascend
in the scale of greatness.
Man’s first impulse is to bow the
head before the grandeur of nature’s
mighty spectacles, before the
rushing cataract and the sweeping
storm, and to adore the Being
whose voice is heard in the tempest,
who dwells in a canopy of
clouds and rides on the wings of
the wind. Filled with this sentiment,
he builds temples, he offers
sacrifices, eucharistic and propitiatory,
he consecrates his faculties to
the service of his God, and applauds
those of his fellows who,
yielding to a still higher reverential
influence, devote themselves in
a special manner to the promotion
of the divine glory and honor.</p>

<p>For this reason not only the
Vestal Virgins themselves deemed
celibacy an honorable privilege
which drew them nearer to the
Deity, and gloried in its faithful
practice, if history is at all truthful;
but their self-sacrifice invested
them with a special halo in the
eyes of the multitude. Had Dr.
Draper shared the ennobling sentiments
of these pagan women, he
would never have uttered the base
slander on humanity&mdash;which puts
his own manhood to the blush, and
brands the warm-blooded days of
his single life&mdash;that “public celibacy
is private wickedness.”</p>

<p>Animated by the same sentiment
of rendering all things subject to
the Divinity, men consecrated to
him the fruits of the earth, and invoked
his blessing on the seedling
buried in the soil. Familiar objects
became typical of divine attributes,
as water of the purity of Diana, and
salt of the incorruptibility of Saturn;
hence the sprinkling of the <i lang="la">aqua
lustralis</i> among the Romans on all
solemn occasions, and the use of
salt in their sacrifices. Even the
scattering of a little dust on the
forehead was to them expressive of
the calm and tranquillity of death
succeeding to the storms and passions
of life. No doubt, had Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Draper recalled those lines of
Virgil:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Hi motus animorum atque hæc certamina tanta</div>
<div class="verse">Pulveris exigui jactu compressa quiescunt,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">he would, in accordance with his
peculiar logic, have perceived in
the ceremonies of Ash-Wednesday
another instance of a return to paganism.
Without entering at greater
length into those spontaneous
expressions of reverence towards
the Deity which abound in every
religious system, and which well up
from the human heart as a necessary
confession of its dependence
on a higher cause, we will hasten to
the conclusion, implied in them,
that there is an identity of external
worship in all religions which, so
far, proclaims an identity of origin.
What, therefore, Dr. Draper pronounces
to be a paganization of
Christianity is nothing more than
acceptance by it of those features
of older creeds which are founded
on truth, and spring from the constitution
of human nature.</p>

<p>What though the Romans did
pay homage to Lares and Penates,
to river gods and tutelary deities;
should that fact stigmatize as idolatrous
or heathenish the reverence
exhibited by Christians towards the
Blessed Virgin and the saints?
Does not the fact rather indicate,
by its very universality, that it is
part of the divine economy, and
that such worship best represents
the wants of the human heart? Assuredly,
this is not intended as a
vindication of pagan practices, but
aimed to show that, in the struggles
of the human heart to satisfy its
cravings, an undeserting instinct
guides it along a path which, however
tortuous and winding, leads in
the end to truth. Draper’s charge
of paganization in all respects resembles
Voltaire’s assertion that
Christianity is a counterfeit of
Buddhism.</p>

<p>That noted infidel contended
that celibacy, monasticism, mendicity,
voluntary poverty, humility,
and mortification of the senses, were
so many features of Buddhism unblushingly
borrowed by the Christian
Church. But, like the other
misstatements of Voltaire, made
through pure love of mischief, this
one has been refuted time and again.
It has been shown that the ethics
of Buddha flow from the dogma
that ignorance, passion, and desire
are the root of all evil, and, this
principle granted, nothing could be
more natural than the moral system
thence resulting. In the Christian
code, on the contrary, purity,
voluntary poverty, and mortification
of the senses are practised for their
own sake; not for the purpose of
enlightenment or the extirpation
of ignorance, but that our natures
may thereby become purified. No
matter, therefore, how strong and
striking analogies may be, the difference
in principle destroys the theories
of Voltaire and Draper; for similar
consequences often proceed from
widely differing premises. We see
this fact impressively exhibited in
the practice of auricular confession
as it exists among the followers of
Gautama. According to them, the
evil tendencies of the human heart
are manifold and varied, and, to be
successfully combated, must be divided
into classes. Thus the sin
of sensuality admits of a division
into excess at table and concupiscence
of the flesh, the latter being
in turn subdivided into lust of the
eye and lust of the body, evil
thoughts, evil practices, etc. We
have here in reality a true system
of casuistry. Faults should be
confessed with sorrow and an accompanying
determination not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
repeat them; nay, even wrongs must
be repaired as far as possible, and
stolen property be restored. Such
are the views which have been
firmly held by the disciples of
Buddha from time immemorial.
Thus we find confession and its
concomitant practices established
among the Buddhists on grounds of
pure reason; and surely the fact
is no argument against the same
practice in the Christian Church,
nor does the existence of the practice
among Christians necessarily
denote a Buddhic origin. The
explanation is still the same that
practices and beliefs founded on
the wants of human nature are universal,
circumscribed neither by
church nor creed. We believe,
therefore, that Dr. Draper’s philosophy
of gradual paganization is
not tenable; and if we strip it of a
certain veneer of elegant verbiage,
we shall find a rather dull load of
unsupported assertion beneath:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Desinit in piscem mulier formosa superne.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The whole account of this pretended
paganization breathes a spirit of
bitterness and malignity that makes
one perforce smile at the title-page
of the book, on which is inscribed
the name of that sweet daughter of
philosophy, Science. The reader
is constantly startled by volleys of
assertions, contemptuous, blasphemous,
ironical, and derisive. Indeed,
it may be said that hatred of
Catholic doctrine and usages is the
attendant demon of Dr. Draper’s
life, the wraith that haunts him day
and night. He says that it was for
the gratification of the Empress
Helena the Saviour’s cross was discovered;
that when the people embraced
the knees of S. Cyril after
the Blessed Virgin was declared
Mother of God, it was the old instinct
peeping out&mdash;their ancestors
would have done the same for
Diana; that the festival of the Purification
was invented to remove the
uneasiness of heathen converts on
account of the loss of their <i lang="la">Lupercalia</i>,
or feasts of Pan; that quantities
of dust were brought from the
Holy Land, and sold at enormous
prices as antidotes against devils,
etc., <i lang="la">ad nauseam</i>. Through all this
rodomontade we perceive not a
single attempt at proof, only an unbroken
tissue of unsupported assertion.
It is said; it is openly stated;
there is a belief that&mdash;these
are Draper’s usual formularies
whenever an obscure but impure
and blasphemous tradition is related
by him. When, however, he
surpasses himself in obscenity, he
drops even this thin disguise of
reasoning, and boldly asserts. But
with matter of this sort we will not
stain our pages. Indeed, these vile
and obscure traditions seem to have
a special charm for our author.
Worse, however, than this packing
of silly and stupid fables into his
book is the implied understanding
that the church is answerable for
them all. She it is who falsifies
decretals, invents miracles, discovers
fraudulent relics, beholds
apparitions, sanctions the trial by
fire, massacres a whole cityful, and
perpetrates every crime in the calendar.
Surely, she were a very
monster of iniquity, the real scarlet
lady, the beast with seven heads,
were the half true of her which Dr.
Draper lays at her door. There is
in it, however, the manifest intent
and outline of a crusade against the
church and the institutions she fosters;
the shadowing forth of a purpose
to array against her, what is
more formidable than Star Chamber
or Inquisition&mdash;the feelings of unreflecting
millions who are allured by
the glamour of manner to the utter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
disregard of matter. But it must
be remembered that Exeter Hall
fanaticism has never found a genial
home on this side of the Atlantic,
and we are not afraid that
the stupid conglomeration of silly
charges brought against the church
by Dr. Draper, more akin to fatuous
drivel than to the dignified
and scholarly arraignment of a
philosopher, will do more than provoke
a pitying smile. His feeble
blows fall on adamantine sides which
have oft resisted shafts aimed with
deadlier intent than these:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Telumque imbelle sine ictu</div>
<div class="verse">Conjecit.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But there is another explanation of
the successive accumulation of doctrines
and practices in the church
which will perhaps come more
within the reach of Dr. Draper’s
appreciation, as it throws light on
the history of science itself, and
underlies the growth of every system
of philosophy. We speak of
the doctrine of development. Draper
unfolded, even pathetically, the
impressive picture of science springing
from very humble beginnings,
and growing dauntlessly, despite
bigotry and persecutions, into that
colossal structure of to-day which,
according to him, shelters the highest
hopes and aspirations of men,
and assures to them a glorious future
of absorption into the universal
spirit&mdash;viz., annihilation. “Ab
exiguis profecta initiis, eo creverit
ut jam magnitudine laboret sua.”
This gradual development he proclaims
to be the natural expansion
and growth of science, on which
theory he predicts for it an unending
career of glory&mdash;“crescit occulto
velut arbor ævo.” But he is indignant
that the church did not spring
into existence, like Minerva from
the brain of Jupiter, armed cap-a-pie,
in the full bloom of her maturity
and charms. Because she did
not do so, every advance on her
part was retrogressive, and her
growth was the addition of “a
horse’s neck to a human head.”
She borrowed, compromised, and
substituted; so that, if we believe
Dr. Draper, no <i lang="la">olla podrida</i> could
be composed of more heterogeneous
elements than the Christian
Church.</p>

<p>She placed under contribution
not only paganism, but Mahometanism,
and filched a few thoughts
from Buddha, Lao-Tse, and Confucius.
The least courtesy we
might expect from Dr. Draper is
that we may be allowed to attempt
to prove that Christianity, like every
system entrusted to the custody of
men, is necessarily affected on its
secular side by that wardship, and
so far is subject to the same conditions.
But no; he condemns in advance,
and so fastens the gyves of
his condemnation on the church as
apparently not to leave even a loop-hole
of escape, or a possible rational
explanation of the successive
events of her history.</p>

<p>But enough of this. Even to
the most ordinary mind the thin
veil of philosophy in which Dr. Draper
wraps his balderdash of paganization
is sufficiently easy of penetration.
And what does he offer to
the Christian who would range himself
under the new banner? In
what attractive forms does Draper
present his science to win the sympathies
and sentiments of men, and
make them forego the hopes of
eternal happiness whispered on the
cross? Here is one: <i lang="la">Ex uno disce
omnes</i>. When Newton succeeded
in proving that the influence of the
earth’s attraction extended as far
as the moon, and caused her to revolve
in her orbit around the earth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
he was so overcome by the flooding
of truth upon his mind that he was
compelled to call in the assistance
of another to complete the proof.
A pretty picture, no doubt, and a
fit canonization of science. But
let us contrast it with a Xavier expiring
on the arid plains of an eastern
isle, far away from the last comforting
words and soothing touch
of a friend, yet happy beyond expression
in the firmness of his faith,
while clasping in his dying hands
the crucifix, which to him had
been no stumbling-block, but the
incitement to labor through ten
years of incomparable suffering
among a degraded race. Or place
it beside a Vincent de Paul, who
from dawn to darkness traversed
the slums of Paris, picking up waifs,
the jetsam and flotsam of society,
washing them, feeding them, dressing
their sores, and nursing them
more tenderly than a mother. Or
contrast its flimsy sentimentality
with the motives which sped missionaries
across unknown oceans,
over the Andes, the Himalayas, and
the Rocky Mountains, and into the
ice-bound wildernesses of Canada,
to subdue the savage Iroquois by the
mildness of the Gospel; to found a
new golden age on the plains of
Paraguay; to preach the evangel
of peace and purity through the
wide limits of the Flowery Kingdom;
and to seal with their blood
the ceaseless toil of their lives.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Dr. Draper, evidently, has not
read the <cite>Decline and Fall of the
Roman Empire</cite> in vain. Not only
does the same anti-Christian spirit
breathe through his pages, but he
has seized the stilted style of Gibbon,
deemed philosophical, which
is never at home but when soaring
amid the clouds. There is a pomp
and parade of philosophy, an assumption
of dignified tranquillity, a
tone of mock impartiality, which
vividly recall the defective qualities
of Gibbon’s work. But in studying
these features of style, which
necessitate a deal of dogmatism,
Draper has allowed himself to be
betrayed into numberless errors in
philosophy. Perhaps an illustration
or two will help to give point
to our remarks. On page 243 he
writes: “If there be a multiplicity
of worlds in infinite space, there is
also a succession of worlds in infinite
time. As one after another
cloud replaces cloud in the skies,
so this starry system, the universe,
is the successor of countless others
that have preceded it, the predecessor
of countless others that will
follow. There is an unceasing metamorphosis,
a sequence of events,
without beginning or end.”</p>

<p>Is not this</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A pithless branch beneath a fungous rind”?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Is Dr. Draper aware that Gassendi,
Newton, Descartes, and Leibnitz
devoted the highest efforts of
their noble intellects to the consideration
of time and space, and
would long have hesitated before
thus flippantly affixing the epithet
“infinite” to either? What is space
apart from the contained bodies?
If it contains nothing, or rather if
there is nothing in space, space itself
is nothing; it merely represents
to us the possibility of extended
bodies. And if it is nothing, how
can it be infinite? The application
of the word infinite to time is
still more inappropriate. There
can be no such thing as infinite
time. Let us take Dr. Draper’s
own successive periods, though embracing
millions of years, and we
contend that there must be some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
beginning to them. For if there is
no beginning to them, they are already
infinite in number&mdash;that is,
they are already a number without
beginning or end. But this cannot
be. For we can consider either
the past series of periods capable
of augmentation by periods to come;
and what then becomes of Draper’s
infinity? For surely that is not
infinite which is susceptible of increase.
Or we can consider the past
series minus one or two of its periods&mdash;a
supposition equally fatal to
the notion of infinity. Time, then,
is of a purely finite character, and
is nothing else than the successive
changes which finite beings undergo.
More nonsensical still is
the notion of “a sequence of events
without beginning or end.” We
must discriminate here between an
actual series and a potential series
of events, which Dr. Draper forgets
to do; for on the distinction a great
deal depends. An actual series can
never be infinite, for we can take
it at any given stage of its progress,
whether at the present moment or
in the past, and consider it increased
by one; but any number susceptible
of increase can be represented
by figures, since it is finite, that is,
determinate. It cannot be said that
it extends into the past without
beginning, for the dilemma always
recurs that it is either finite or
infinite; if finite, it must be represented
by figures, and that destroys
the idea of a non-beginning;
and if it is infinite, it cannot be
increased, which is absurd. And
if we ask for a cause for any one
event in the reputed unending series,
we are referred to the event
immediately preceding, which in
turn has for its cause another prior
event. If, however, we inquire for
the cause of the whole series, we
are told that there is none such;
there is naught but an eternal succession
of events. Is not this, as
some author says, as if we were to
ask what upholds the last link in a
chain suspended from an unknown
height, and should receive the answer
that the link next to the last
supports it, and the third supports
the two beneath, and so on, each
higher link supports a weightier
burden? If then we should ask,
What is it that supports the whole?
we are told that it supports itself.
Therefore a finite weight cannot
support itself in opposition to the
laws of gravitation; much less can
another finite weight twice as heavy
as the first, and less and less can it
do so as the weight increases; but
when the weight becomes infinite,
nothing is required to uphold it.
The reasoning is entirely analogous
to Draper’s, who speaks of cloud
replacing cloud in the skies without
beginning, without end. “Quos
Deus vult perdere prius dementat.”
Bacon has well said that the exclusive
consideration of secondary
causes leads to the exclusion of
God from the economy of the universe,
while a deeper insight reveals
of necessity a First Cause on which
all others depend. This is exactly
the trouble with Dr. Draper. He
will not lift his purblind gaze from
the mere phenomena of nature to
their cause, but is satisfied to revolve
for ever in the vicious circle
of countless effects without a cause.
If we are to judge by the additional
glow which pervades what he has
written concerning the nebular hypothesis,
he unquestionably considers
that theory a conclusive proof
of the non-interference of the Deity
in the affairs of the universe.</p>

<p>Now, we have no particular fault
to find with the nebular hypothesis.
It is only an explanation of a change
which matter has undergone. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
does not affect the question of creation
whether matter was first in a
state of incandescent gas, or sprang
at the bidding of the eternal fiat
into its manifold conditions of to-day.
Indeed, we will grant that
there is a plausibility in the theory
which to many minds renders it
fascinating; but that does not make
matter eternal and self-conserving.
It is entirely consistent with the
dogma of creation that God first
made matter devoid of harmonious
forms and relations, and that these
slowly developed in accordance
with the laws he appointed. There
is nothing inconsistent in supposing
that our terrestrial planet is a fragment
struck off from the central
mass, and that, after having undergone
numerous changes, it at last
settled down into a fit abode for
man. The church never expressed
herself pro or con; for no matter
how individual writers may have
felt and written, no matter how
much they may have sought to place
this or that physical theory in antagonism
with revealed truth, the
church never took action, for the
reason that the question lies beyond
the sphere of her infallible judgment
until it touches upon the revealed
doctrine. It is Dr. Draper,
therefore, who strenuously seeks to
draw inferences from modern physical
theories, so as to put them in
conflict, not only with revelation, but
with the truths of natural theology.
After having given an outline of the
nebular hypothesis, he says: “If
such be the cosmogony of the solar
system, such the genesis of the
planetary worlds, we are constrained
to extend our view of the dominion
of law, and to recognize its
agency in the creation as well as in
the conservation of the innumerable
orbs that throng the universe.”
Now, what he means by extending
our views of the dominion of law is
to make it paramount and supreme.
But what is this law? If its agency
is to be recognized in the creation
of the innumerable orbs that throng
the universe, it certainly must have
existed prior to that event, else Dr.
Draper uses the word creation in a
sense entirely novel. Now, supposing,
as we are fairly bound to do,
that Dr. Draper attaches to the
term creation its ordinary signification,
we will have the curious spectacle
of law creating that of which
it is but the expression. We cannot
perceive what other meaning
we are to extract from the saying
that we must recognize the agency
of law in the creation of the universe.
Law is, therefore, the creator
of the universe; that is to say,
“The general expression of the conditions
under which certain assemblages
of phenomena occur” (Carpenter’s
definition of law) ushered
into existence the cause of those
phenomena. Can anything more
absurd be conceived? But apart
from the notion of law being at the
bottom of creation, how can Dr.
Draper, consistently with his ideas
of “infinite space,” “infinite time,”
“sequence of events without beginning
or end,” admit such a thing
as creation at all? Creation is
the transition of a portion of the
eternal possibles in the divine
mind from a state of possibility into
one of physical existence, at the
bidding of God’s infinite power.
Supposing, then, that it is in this
sense Dr. Draper uses the word
creation, he must of necessity discard
the doctrine of the eternity of
matter, and his <i lang="la">nugæ canoræ</i> concerning
“the immutability of law,”
“law that dominates overall,” “unending
succession of events,” become
the frothings of a distempered
mind. But when a person writes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
accordance with no fixed principles,
only as the intellectual caprice of
the moment dictates, he necessarily
falls into glaring and fatal inconsistencies.
For not many pages after
this implied admission of creation,
even though it be the inane
creation by law, he says: “These
considerations incline us to view
favorably the idea of transmutations
of one form into another rather
than that of sudden creations. Creation
implies an abrupt appearance,
transformation a gradual change.”
He thus again rejects the doctrine
of creation in almost the same
breath in which he spoke of it as
brought about by the agency of law.
The question here occurs, Are the
notions of creation and law antipodal?
Can they not coexist?
For our own part, we see nothing
inconsistent in the supposition that
God created the universe, under
stable laws for its guidance and
conservation. The very simplicity
of the compatible existence of the
two puzzles us to know what objection
to it the ingenuity of Dr. Draper
has discovered. For it must
be understood that his stated incompatibility
is a wearisome assumption
throughout&mdash;wearisome,
for the mind, ever on the alert to
find a reason for the statement, withdraws
from the hopeless task tired
and disgusted. For instance, at the
close of his remarks concerning the
nebular theory he says: “But
again it may be asked, ‘Is
there not something profoundly
impious in this? Are we not
excluding Almighty God from the
world he has made?’” The words
are sneeringly written. They are
supposed to contain their own reply,
and the writer passes on to
something else. He does not attempt
to prove that the nebular
hypothesis is at variance with creation,
except with such a view of
the act as he himself entertains.
And this brings us to the consideration
of his views concerning this
sublime dogma. Draper evidently
supposes that creation took place
by fits and starts, as figures pop
out in a puppet-show. Hence he
is constantly contrasting the grandeur
of a slow development, an ever-progressing
evolution, with the unphilosophical
idea of sudden and
abrupt creations. Though we fail
to perceive anything derogatory to
the infinite wisdom of the Creator
in supposing that he launched
worlds into existence perfect and
complete, the idea of creation in
the Christian sense does not necessarily
imply this. We hold that the
iron logic of facts forces us to the
admission of creation in general, in
opposition to the senseless doctrine
of unbeginning and unending series
and sequences; and while we do
not pretend to determine the manner
in which God proceeded with
his work, we likewise hold that the
gradual appearance of planet after
planet of the innumerable orbs
that stud the firmament, of genus
after genus, and species after species,
can be far more philosophically
referred to the positive act of an
infinite power than to the vague
operation of law. Draper, therefore,
shivers a lance against a windmill
when he sets up his doctrine
of evolution against a purely imaginary
creation. While he thus arraigns
the doctrine of creation as
shortsighted and unphilosophical,
it is amusing to contemplate the
substitute therefor which his system
offers. On page 192 he says:
“Abrupt, arbitrary, disconnected
creative acts may serve to illustrate
the divine power; but that continuous,
unbroken chain of organisms
which extends from palæozoic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
formations to the formations of recent
times&mdash;a chain in which each
link hangs on a preceding and sustains
a succeeding one&mdash;demonstrates
to us not only that the production
of animated beings is governed
by law, but that it is by law
that it has undergone no change.
In its operation through myriads of
ages there has been no variation,
no suspension.” We have already
proved that whatever is finite or
contingent in the actual order
must necessarily have had a beginning&mdash;a
fact which Draper himself
seems to admit when he speaks of
the creative agency of law; and
the question arises what it is which
Dr. Draper substitutes for the creative
act. Creation by law is an
absurdity, since law is but the expression
of the regularity of phenomena,
once the fact of the universe
has been granted. Unbeginning
and unending series are not
only an absurdity, but a palpable
evasion of the difficulty. We have,
therefore, according to Dr. Draper,
a tremendous effect without a
cause. When we view the many-sided
spectacle of nature, the star-bespangled
empyrean, the endless
forms of life which the microscope
reveals, the harmony and order of
the universe, we naturally inquire,
Whence sprang this mighty panorama?
What all-potent Being gave
it existence? Draper’s answer is, It
had no beginning, it will have no
end&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, it began nowhere, it will
end nowhere. There it is, and be
satisfied. The Christian replies
that it is the work of an eternal,
necessary, and all-perfect Being,
who contains within himself the
reason of his own existence, and
whose word is sufficient to usher
into being countless other worlds
of far vaster magnitude than any
that now exist.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole book are
scattered references to this supremacy
of law over creation, and the
inference is constantly deduced
that every curse which has befallen
humanity, every retarding influence
placed in the way of human progress,
has proceeded from the doctrine
of creation. Creation alone
can give color to the doctrine of
miracles, and creation renders impossible
the safe prediction of astronomical
events. For these reasons
Draper condemns it, not only
as an intellectual monstrosity, but
as morally bad. While we admit
that the possibility of miracles does
depend on the admission of an intelligent
Cause of all things, it by
no means follows that the same admission
invalidates the safe prediction
of an eclipse or a comet.
Draper’s words touching the matter
are such a curiosity in their
way that we cannot forbear quoting
them. On page 229 he says:
“Astronomical predictions of all
kinds depend upon the admission
of this fact: that there never has
been and never will be any intervention
in the operation of natural
laws. The scientific philosopher
affirms that the condition of the
world at any given moment is the
direct result of its condition in the
preceding moment, and the direct
cause of its condition in the subsequent
moment. Law and chance
are only different names for mechanical
necessity.”</p>

<p>Parodying the words of Mme.
Roland, we might exclaim, O Philosophy!
what follies are committed
in thy name. Just think of it,
reader, because God is supposed
to superintend, by virtue of his
infinite intelligence, the processes
of universal nature, with the power
to derogate from the laws he
himself appointed, he must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
so capricious that constancy, harmony,
and regularity are strangers
to him. Supposing we take for
granted the possibility of miracles,
it does not ensue that God is about
to disturb the regularity of the universe
at the bidding of him who
asks. The circumstances attending
the performance of a miracle are so
obvious that there can be no room
for doubting the constancy of law
operation. Thus the promotion of
an evidently good purpose, which
is the prime intent of a miracle,
precludes the caprice which alone
could render unsafe the prediction
of a physical occurrence. As well
might we question the probable
course a man of well-known probity
and discretion will pursue under
specified circumstances, with this
difference: that as God is infinitely
wise, in proportion is the probability
great that he will not depart
from his usual course, except for
most extraordinary reasons. And
if the safety of a prediction depending
on such circumstances
is not as great as that which depends
on mechanical necessity, we
must base our scepticism on very
shadowy grounds. Father Secchi
can compute the next solar eclipse
as well as Dr. Diaper; and if he
should add, as he undoubtedly
would, D. V., nobody will therefore
be inclined to question the accuracy
of his calculations or doubt
the certainty of the occurrence.
In preference, however, to the admission
of a free agency in the
affairs of the universe, he subscribes
to the stoicism of Grecian philosophy,
which subjects all things to a
stern, unbending necessity, and
makes men act by the impulse and
determination of their nature.
“This system offered a support in
their hour of trial, not only to many
illustrious Greeks, but also to some
of the great philosophers, statesmen,
generals, and emperors of
Rome&mdash;a system which excluded
chance from everything, and asserted
the direction of all events by
irresistible necessity to the promotion
of perfect good; a system of
earnestness, sternness, austerity, virtue&mdash;a
protest in favor of the common
sense of mankind. And perhaps
we shall not dissent from the
remark of Montesquieu, who affirms
that the destruction of the Stoics
was a great calamity to the human
race; for they alone made great
citizens, great men.” Men can
therefore be great in Draper’s
sense when they can no longer be
virtuous; they can acquire fame and
win the gratitude of posterity when
they can no longer merit; in a
word, mechanical necessity; the
same inexorable fatality which impels
the river-waters to seek the
sea, which turns the magnet to the
north, and makes the planets run
their destined courses, presides over
the conduct of men, and elevates,
ennobles their actions. Free-will
is chance; Providence an impertinent
and debasing interference; and
virtue the firmness, born of necessity,
which made Cato end his days
by his own hand. Such is Draper’s
substitute in the moral order for
the teachings of Christianity&mdash;a system
inevitably tending to build a
Paphian temple on the site of every
Christian church, and to revive the
infamies which the pen of Juvenal
so scathingly satirized, and for
which S. Paul rebuked the Romans
in terms of frightful severity and
reprobation. For what consideration
can restrain human passions,
if men deem their actions to be a
necessary growth or expansion of
their nature, if the good and bad in
human deeds are as the tempest
that wrecks, or the gentle dews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
that fructify and animate the vegetable
world? His whole book is a
cumbersome and disjointed argument
in favor of necessity, as opposed
to free agency; of law, as opposed
to Providence. The manner
of his refuting the existence of divine
Providence is so far novel and
original that we are tempted to reproduce
it for those of our readers
who prefer not to lose time by perusing
the work in full. On page
243 he says: “Were we set in the
midst of the great nebula of Orion,
how transcendently magnificent the
scene! The vast transformation,
the condensations of a fiery mist
into worlds, might seem worthy of
the immediate presence, the supervision,
of God; here, at our distant
station, where millions of miles are
inappreciable to our eyes, and suns
seem no bigger than motes in the
air, that nebula is more insignificant
than the faintest cloud.
Galileo, in his description of the
constellation of Orion, did not think
it worth while so much as to mention
it. The most rigorous theologian
of those days would have seen
nothing to blame in imputing its
origin to secondary causes; nothing
irreligious in failing to invoke
the arbitrary interference of God in
its metamorphoses. If such be
the conclusion to which we come
respecting it, what would be the
conclusion to which an Intelligence
seated in it would come respecting
us? It occupies an extent of space
millions of miles greater than that
of our solar system; we are invisible
from it, and therefore absolutely
insignificant. Would such an
Intelligence think it necessary to require
for our origin and maintenance
the immediate intervention
of God?” That is to say, we are too
insignificant for God’s notice, because
larger worlds roll through
space millions of miles from us, and
God would have enough to do, if at
all disposed to interfere, in looking
after them, without occupying his
important time with terra and her
Liliputian denizens.</p>

<p>It is evident from this passage
that Draper’s mind can never rise
to a grand conception. It would
not do to tell him that the Intelligence
which superintends and controls
the universe “reaches from
end to end powerfully, and disposes
all things mildly”; that his infinite
ken “numbers the hair of our
heads,” notes the sparrow’s fall, and
sweeps over the immensity of space
with its thronging orbs, by one and
the same act of a supreme mind.
The furthest is as the nearest, the
smallest as the greatest, with Him
who holds the universe in the
hollow of his hand, and whose omnipotent
will could create and conserve
myriad constellations greater
than Orion. In the passage just
quoted Dr. Draper commits the
additional blunder of confounding
creation in general with a special
view conveniently entertained by
himself. His objection to creation,
as before remarked, proceeds on
the notion that creation is necessarily
adverse to slow and continuous
development, such as the facts of
nature point out as having been
the course through which the world
has reached its present maturity.
He does not seem able to understand
that, creation having taken
place, the whole set of physical
phenomena which underlie recent
physical theories may have come to
pass, as he maintains; only we must
assign a beginning. His whole
disagreement with the doctrine of
creation is founded on this principle
of a non-beginning, though he vainly
strives to make it appear that he
objects to it as interfering with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
regular, progressive development.
On page 239 he says: “Shall we,
then, conclude that the solar and
the starry systems have been called
into existence by God, and that he
has then imposed upon them by his
arbitrary will laws under the control
of which it was his pleasure
that their movements should be
made?</p>

<p>“Or are there reasons for believing
that these several systems came
into existence, not by such an arbitrary
fiat, but through the operation
of law?” The shallowness of this
philosophy the simplest can sound.
As well might we speak of a nation
or state springing into existence
through the operation of those laws
which are subsequently enacted for
its guidance. Prayer and the possibility
of miracles are equally assailed
by Draper’s doctrine of
necessary law. His argument
against the former is very closely
akin to J. J. Rousseau’s objection to
prayer. “Why should we,” says the
pious author of <cite>Emile</cite>, “presume to
hope that God will change the order
of the universe at our request?
Does he not know better what is
suited to our wants than our short-sighted
reason can perceive, to say
nothing of the blasphemy which
sets up our judgment in opposition
to the divine decrees?” The
opposition of Draper and Tyndall
to prayer proceeds exactly on the
same notion&mdash;the absurdity, namely,
of supposing that our petitions can
ever have the effect of changing the
fixed and unalterable scheme of
the universe. Tyndall went so far
as to propose a prayer-gauge by
separating the inmates of a hospital
into praying and non-praying ones,
and seeing what proportion of the
two classes would recover more
rapidly. Those three distinguished
philosophers evidently never understood
the nature and conditions of
prayer, else they would not hold
such language. God changes nothing
at our instance, but counts
our prayer in as a part of the very
plan on which the universe was
projected. In the divine mind
every determination of our will is
perceived from eternity, as indeed
are all the events of creation. But
we admit a distinction of logical
priority of some over others. Thus
God’s knowledge of our determination
to act is logically subsequent
to the determination itself, since
the latter is the object of the divine
knowledge, and must have a logical
precedence over it. Prayer, then, is
compatible with the regularity of
the universe and infinite wisdom,
because God, having perceived our
prayer and observed the conditions
accompanying it, determined in
eternity to grant or to withhold it,
and regulated the universe in accordance
with such determination.
Our prayers have been granted or
withheld in the long past as regards
us, but not in the past as regards
God, in whom there is no change
nor shadow of a change. It is evident
from this how absurd is Tyndall’s
notion of testing the efficacy
of prayer in the manner he proposed,
and how unjust is Draper’s
constant arrow-shooting at shrine-cures
and petitions for health addressed
to God and to his saints.
Nor does the granting of a prayer
necessarily imply a departure from
the natural course of events. The
foreseen goodness and piety of a
man can have determined God to
allow the natural order and sequence
of events to proceed in such
a manner as to develop conformably
to his petition. In this there
is no disturbance of the natural
order, since the expression means
nothing else than the regularity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
with which phenomena occur in
their usual way&mdash;a fact entirely consistent
with the theory of prayer.</p>

<p>It is true, however, that the history
of the church exhibits many
well-authenticated examples of
prayers being granted under circumstances
which implied the performance
of a miracle or a suspension
of the effects of law. To this
Draper opposes three arguments:
first, the inherent impossibility of
miracles; secondly, the capricious
disturbance of the universe which
would ensue; and, thirdly, the impossibility
of discerning between
miracles and juggling tricks or the
marvellous achievements of science.
To the first argument we would return
an <i lang="la">argumentum ad hominem</i>.
While Dr. Draper sneeringly repudiates
a miracle which implies a
derogation from physical law, he
unwittingly admits a miracle tenfold
more astounding. The argument
was directed against Voltaire
long years ago, and has been repeatedly
employed since.</p>

<p>Suppose, then, that a whole cityful
of people should testify to the
resurrection of a dead man from the
grave; would we be justified in rejecting
the testimony on the sole
ground of the physical impossibility
of the occurrence? We would thereby
suppose that a whole population,
divided into the high and low born,
the ignorant and the educated, the
good and the bad, with interests,
passions, hopes, prejudices, and aspirations
as wide apart as the poles,
should secretly conspire to impose
on the rest of the world, and this
so successfully that not even one
would reveal the gigantic deception.
History abounds in instances of
the sort, in recitals of sudden cures
witnessed by thousands, of conflagrations
suddenly checked, of
plagues disappearing in a moment;
and if we are pleased to refuse the
testimony because of the physical
impossibility, we are reduced to the
necessity of admitting, not a miracle,
but a monstrosity in the moral order.
It is true that Dr. Draper
quietly ignores this feature of the
case, and is satisfied with the objection
to the possibility of miracles
on physical grounds, without taking
the pains to inquire whether circumstances
can be conceived in
which this physical possibility may
be set aside. Complacently resting
his argument here, the “impartial”
doctor, whose lofty mind ranges in
the pure ether of immaculate
truth, accuses the church of filling
the air with sprites whose duty it
is to perform miracles every moment.
Recklessly and breathlessly
he repeats and multiplies the old,
time-worn, oft-refuted, and ridiculous
stories which stain the pages
of long-forgotten Protestant controversialists,
and which well-informed
men of to-day not in communion
with the church would blush to repeat,
as likely to stamp their intelligence
with vulgarity and credulity.
Not so with Dr. Draper; for not
only does he rehash what for years
we have been hearing from Pecksniffs
and Chadbands <i lang="la">usque ad nauseam</i>,
but he introduces his stale
stories in the most incongruous
manner. Shrine-cures, as he calls
them, he finds to have gone hand
in hand with the absence of carpeted
floors, and relic-worship with
smoky chimneys, poor raiment, and
unwholesome food. No doubt his
far-seeing mind has been able to
discover a necessary relation between
those things which the ordinary
judgment would pronounce
most incongruous and dissonant.
Draper not only refuses to recognize
the long and laborious efforts
of the church to ameliorate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
condition of the masses, to lift them
from the misery and insanitary surroundings
into which they had sunk
during the night of Roman decadence,
and in which the internecine
feuds of the robber barons and
princes, of feudal masters and vassals,
had left them, but he impudently
charges the church with
being the author of their wrongs
and wretchedness. It is true the
same charge has been made before
by vindictive and passionate writers,
and it receives no additional weight
at the hands of Dr. Draper by being
left, like Mahomet’s coffin, without
prop or support. Since Maitland’s
work first disabused Englishmen
of the opinions they had formed
concerning mediæval priest-craft
and church tyranny, no writer has
had the hardihood to revive the
exploded slanders of Stillingfleet
and Fletcher, till this latest anti-papist
felt that he had received a
mission to do so.</p>

<p>Draper’s belief that the admitted
possibility of miracles would tend
to disturb the regular succession of
natural phenomena is simply puerile;
for miracles occur only under
such circumstances as all men understand
to preclude caprice and irregularity.
Thus the daily-recurring
mystery of transubstantiation
still takes place upon our altars, and,
so far as that tremendous fact is
concerned, we might all cling to the
idea of necessary, immutable law;
for no order is disturbed, no planet
fails to perform its accustomed revolution.
As for its being impossible
for Catholics to distinguish between
real miracles and juggleries, it is
very evident that, in keeping with
his general opinion of believers in
miracles, he must rate their standard
of intelligence at an exceedingly
low figure. A miracle supposes
a derogation of the laws of the
physical world, and is never accepted
till its character in this sense has
been thoroughly proved. A Protestant
writer of high intelligence,
who not long since was present in
Rome at an investigation into the
evidence adduced to prove the
genuineness of certain miracles attributed
to a servant of God, in
whose behalf the title of venerable
was demanded, remarked that, had
the same searching scrutiny been
employed in every legal case which
had fallen under his observation, he
would not hesitate to place implicit
confidence in the rigid impartiality
of the judge, the logical nature of
the evidence, and the unimpeachable
veracity of the witnesses. Dr.
Draper, therefore, supposes, on the
part of those whom he claims to be
incapable or unwilling to discriminate
between miracles, in the sense
defined, and mere feats of legerdemain,
an unparalleled stupidity or
contemptible roguery. Since, however,
he constitutes himself supreme
judge in the case, we will place in
juxtaposition with this judgment
another, which will readily show to
what extent his discriminating sense
may be trusted. On page 298 he
says: “The Virgin Mary, we are
assured by the evangelists, had accepted
the duties of married life,
and borne to her husband several
children.” As this is a serious accusation,
and the doctor, in presenting
it, desires to maintain his high
reputation as an erudite hermeneutist
and strict logician by adducing
irrefragable proofs in its support,
he triumphantly refers to S. Matt. i.
25. “And he knew her not till she
brought forth her first-born.” We
are reluctant to mention, when it is
question of the accuracy of so learned
a man as Dr. Draper, that among
the Hebrews the word <em>until</em> denotes
only what has occurred, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
regard to the future; as when God
says: “I am till you grow old.”
If Draper’s exegesis is correct concerning
S. Matt. i. 25, then we must
infer that God as surely implies, in
the words quoted, that he will
cease to exist at a specified time,
as he explicitly states he will exist
till that time. But, not satisfied
with this display of Scriptural erudition,
he refers, in support of the same
statement, to S. Matt. xiii. 55, 56;
and, because mention is there made
of Jesus’ brethren and sisters, the
latest foe to Mary’s virginity concludes
that these were brothers and
sisters by consanguinity. What a
large number of brothers and sisters
our preachers of every Sunday must
have, who address by these endearing
terms their numerous congregations!
If, however, Dr. Draper desires
to ascertain who these brethren
and sisters were, he will find
that they were cousins to our divine
Saviour; it being a favored
custom among the Jews thus to
style near relatives. S. Matt, xxvii.
56 and S. John xix. 25 will define
the exact relation the persons in
question bore to the Saviour. Such
are the penetration, profundity, and
erudition of the man who brands
as imbeciles, dupes, and rogues the
major part of Christendom! But
perhaps it may be said that hermeneutics
are not Draper’s <i lang="fr">forte</i>, owing
to his supreme contempt of the New
and Old Testaments, and that he has
won his laurels in the field of philosophy.
We have already hinted that
his perspicuity in philosophical discussions
is in advance of his subtlety,
for the reason that he keeps
well on the surface, and exhibits a
commendable anxiety not to venture
beyond his depth. At times,
however, an intrepidity, born of ignorance,
overcomes his native timidity,
and, with amazing confidence,
he plays the oft-assumed <i lang="fr">rôle</i>
of the bull in a china-shop. Mixing
himself up with the Arian dispute
concerning the Blessed Trinity,
he inclines to the anti-Trinitarian
view, because a son cannot be coeval
with his father! The carnal-minded
Arius thus reasoned, and it
is no wonder Dr. Draper agrees
with him. Had Dr. Draper taken
down from his library shelf the
<cite>Summa</cite> of S. Thomas, the great
extinguisher of Draper’s philosophical
beacon, Averroës, he would
have received such enlightenment as
would have made him blush to concur
in a proposition so utterly unphilosophical.
The Father, as principle
of the Son’s existence, is co-existent
with him as God, and logically
only prior to him as father, just
as a circle is the source whence
the equality of the radii springs;
though, given a circle, the equality
of the radii co-exists, and,
if an eternally existing circle be
conceived, an eternal equality of
radii ensues. The priority is therefore
one of reason, viz., the priority
of a cause to a co-existing effect.
But we have said <i lang="la">satis superque</i>
concerning Draper and his book.
We deplore, not so much the publication
of the volume, as the unhealthy
condition of the public
mind which can hail its appearance
with welcome. As an appetite for
unnatural food argues a diseased
state of the bodily system, so we infer
that men’s minds are sadly
diseased when they take pleasure
in what is so hollow, false, and
shallow as Dr. Draper’s latest addition
to anti-Catholic literature.
We have been obliged to suppress
a considerable portion of the criticisms
we had prepared on particular
portions of this rambling production,
in order not to take up too
much space. We consider it not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
to be worth the space we have
actually given to its refutation.
And yet, of such a book, one of our
principal daily papers has been so
unadvised or thoughtless as to say
that it ought to be made a <em>text-book</em>.
To this proposition we answer by
the favorite exclamation of the wife
of Sir Thomas More: “<span class="smcap">Tilley-Valley</span>!”</p>

<h3>STRAY LEAVES FROM A PASSING LIFE.</h3>

<h4>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">A DINNER AT THE GRANGE&mdash;A PAIR OF OWLS.</span></h4>

<p>As we passed up the gravel walk
of the Grange a face was trying
its prettiest to look scoldingly out
of the window, but could not succeed.
When the eyes lighted upon
my companion, face and eyes together
disappeared. It was a face
that I had seen grow under my
eyes, but it had never occurred to
me hitherto that it had grown so
beautiful. Could that tall young
lady, who did the duties of mistress
of the Grange so demurely, be
the little fairy whom only yesterday
I used to toss upon my shoulder
and carry out into the barnyard to
see the fowls, one hand twined
around my neck, and the other waving
her magic wand with the action
of a little queen&mdash;the same
magic wand that I had spent a
whole hour and a half&mdash;a boy’s
long hour and a half&mdash;in peeling
and notching with my broken penknife,
engraving thereon the cabalistic
characters “F. N.,” which, as
all the world was supposed to know,
signified “Fairy Nell”? And that
was “Fairy” who had just disappeared
from the honeysuckles.
Faith! a far more dangerous fairy
than when I was her war-horse and
she my imperious queen.</p>

<p>I introduced my companion as
an old school-fellow of mine to my
father and sister. So fine-looking
a young man could not fail to impress
my father favorably, who, notwithstanding
his seclusion, had a
keen eye for persons and appearances.
How so fine-looking a
young man impressed my sister I
cannot say, for it is not given to me
to read ladies’ hearts. The dinner
was passing pleasantly enough, when
one of those odd revulsions of feeling
that come to one at times in
the most inopportune situations
came over me. I am peculiarly
subject to fits of this nature, and
only time and years have enabled
me to overcome them to any extent.
By the grave of a friend who
was dear to me, and in presence of
his weeping relatives, some odd recollection
has risen up as it were
out of the freshly-dug grave, and
grinned at me over the corpse’s
head, till I hardly knew whether the
tears in my eyes were brought
there by laughter or by grief. Just
on the attainment of some success,
for which I had striven for months or
years, may be, and to which I had
devoted every energy that was in
me, while the flush of it was fresh on
my cheek and in my heart, and the
congratulations of friends pouring
in on me, has come a drear feeling
like a winter wind across my summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
garden to blast the roses and
wither the dew-laden buds just
opening to the light. Why this
is so I cannot explain; that it
is so I know. It is a mockery
of human nature, and falls on the
harmony of the soul like that terrible
“ha! ha!” of the fiend who
stands by all the while when poor
Faust and innocent Marguerite
are opening their hearts to each
other.</p>

<p>“And so, Mr. Goodal, you are an
old friend of Roger’s? He has told
me about most of his friends. It is
strange he never mentioned your
name before.”</p>

<p>“It is strange,” I broke in hurriedly.
“Kenneth is the oldest of
all, too. I found him first in the
thirteenth century. He bears his
years well, does he not, Fairy?”</p>

<p>My father and Nellie both looked
perplexed. Kenneth laughed.</p>

<p>“What in the world are you talking
about, Roger?” asked my father
in amazement.</p>

<p>“Where do you think I found
him? Burrowing at the tomb of
the Herberts, as though he were
anxious to get inside and pass an
evening with them.”</p>

<p>“And judging the past by the
present, a very agreeable evening I
should have spent,” said Kenneth
gayly.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I will not deny that
you would have found excellent
company,” responded my father,
pleased at the compliment. “The
Herberts. ..” he began.</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, sir, let them
rest in their grave. I have already
surfeited Mr. Goodal with the history
of the Herberts.” Kenneth
was about to interpose, but I went
on: “A strangely-mixed assembly
the Herberts would make in the
other world; granting that there is
another world, and that the members
of our family condescend to
know each other there.”</p>

<p>“Roger!” said Nellie in a warning
tone, while my father reddened
and shifted uneasily in his chair.</p>

<p>“If there be another world and
the Herberts are there, it is impossible
that they can live together <i lang="fr">en
famille</i>. It can scarcely be even
a bowing acquaintance,” I added,
feeling all the while that I was as
rude and undutiful as though I
had risen from my chair and dealt
my father a blow in the face. He
remembered, as I did not, what
was due to our guest, and said
coldly:</p>

<p>“Roger, don’t you think that you
might advantageously change the
subject? Mr. Goodal, I am very
far behind the age, and not equal to
what I suppose is the prevailing
tone among clever young gentlemen
of the present day. I am very old
fogy, very conservative. Try that
sherry.”</p>

<p>The quiet severity of his tone
cut me to the quick. The spirit
of mischief must have been very
near my elbow at that moment.
Instead of taking my lesson in good
part, I felt like a whipped school-boy,
and, regardless of poor Nellie’s
pale face and Kenneth’s silence,
went on resolutely:</p>

<p>“Well, sir, my ancestors are to
me a most interesting topic of conversation,
and I take it that a Herbert
only shows a proper regard for
his own flesh and blood if he inquire
after their eternal no less
than their temporal welfare. What
has become of all the Herberts, I
should dearly like to know?”</p>

<p>“I know, sir, what will become
of one of them, if he continues his
silly and unmannerly cynicism,”
said my father, now fairly aroused.
He was very easily aroused, and I
wonder that he restrained himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
so long. “I cannot imagine, Mr.
Goodal, what possesses the young
men of the present day, or what
they are coming to. Irreverence
for the dead, irreverence for the
living, irreverence for all that is
worthy of reverence, seems to stamp
their character. I trust, sir, indeed
I believe, that you have better feelings
than to think that life and
death, here and hereafter, are fit
subjects for a boy’s sneer. I am
sure that you have that respect for
church and state and&mdash;and things
established that is becoming a gentleman.
I can only regret that my
son is resolved on going as fast as
he can to&mdash;to&mdash;” He glanced at
Nellie, and remained silent.</p>

<p>“I know where you would say,
sir; and in the event of my happy
arrival there, I shall beyond doubt
meet a large section of the Herberts
who have gone before me&mdash;that is,
if church and things established are
to be believed. When one comes
to think of it, what an appalling
number of Herberts must have
gone to the devil!”</p>

<p>“Nellie, my girl, you had better
retire, since your brother forgets
how to conduct himself in the presence
of ladies and gentlemen.”</p>

<p>But Nellie sat still with scared
face, and, though by this time my
heart ached, I could not help continuing:</p>

<p>“But, father, what are we to believe,
or do we believe anything?
Up to a certain period the Herberts
were what their present head&mdash;whom
heaven long preserve!&mdash;would call
rank Papists. Old Sir Roger,
whose epitaph I found Mr. Goodal
endeavoring to decipher this afternoon,
was a Crusader, a soldier of
the cross which, in our enlightenment
and hatred of idolatry, we have
torn down from the altar where he
worshipped, and overturned that
altar itself. Was it for love of
church and things established, as
we understand them, that he sailed
away to the Holy Land, and in his
pious zeal knocked the life out of
many an innocent painim? Was
good Abbot Herbert, whose monumental
brass in the chancel of S.
Wilfrid’s presents him kneeling and
adoring before the chalice that he
verily believed to hold the blood
of Christ, a worshipper of the same
God and a holder of the same faith
as my uncle, Archdeacon Herbert,
who denies and abhors the doctrine
of Transubstantiation, although his
two daughters, who are of the highest
High-Church Anglicans, devoutly
believe in something approaching
it, and, to prove their faith, have enrolled
themselves both in the Confraternity
of the Cope, whose recent
discovery has set Parliament
and all the bench of bishops abuzz?
Is it all a humbug all the way down,
or were the stout, Crusading, Catholic
Herberts real and right,
while we are wrong and a religious
sham? Does the Reformation mark
us off into white sheep and black
sheep, consigning them to hell and
us to heaven? If not, why were
they not Protestants, and why are
we not Catholics, or why are we all
not unbelievers? Can the same
heaven hold all alike&mdash;those who
adored and adore the Sacrament as
God, and those who pronounce adoration
of the Sacrament idolatry
and an abomination?”</p>

<p>My father’s only reply to this
lengthy and irresistible burst of
eloquent reasoning was to ask
Nellie, who had sat stone-still, and
whose eyes were distended in mingled
horror and wonder, for a cup
of coffee. My long harangue seemed
to have a soothing effect upon
my nerves. I looked at Goodal,
who was looking at his spoon. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
felt so sorry that I could have
wished all my words unsaid.</p>

<p>“My dear father, and my dear
Kenneth, and you too, Nellie, pardon
me. I have been unmannerly, grossly
so. I brought you here, Kenneth,
to spend a pleasant evening, and
help us to spend one, and some evil
genius&mdash;a <i lang="el">daimon</i> that I carry about
with me, and cannot always whip
into good behavior&mdash;has had possession
of me for the last half-hour.
It was he that spoke in me, and not
my father’s son, who, were he true
to the lessons and example of his
parent, would as soon think of committing
suicide as a breach of hospitality
or good manners. Now,
as you are antiquarians, I leave
you a little to compare notes, while
I take Fairy out to trip upon the
green, and console her for my passing
heresy with orthodoxy and
Tupper, who, I need not assure
you, is her favorite poet, as he is
of all true English country damsels.
There is the moon beginning to
rise; and there is a certain melting,
a certain watery, quality about
Tupper admirably adapted to moonlight.”</p>

<p>The rest of the evening passed
more pleasantly. After a little we
all went out on the lawn, and sat
there together. The moonlight
nights of the English summer are
very lovely. That night was as a
thousand such, yet it seemed to me
that I had never felt the solemn
beauty of nature so deeply or so
sensibly before. S. Wilfrid’s shone
out high and gray and solemn in
the moon. Through the yew-trees
of the priory down below gleamed
the white tombstones of the churchyard.
A streak of silver quivering
through the land marked the wandering
course of the Leigh. And
high up among the beeches and
the elms sat we, the odors of the
afternoon still lingering on the air,
the melody of a nightingale near by
wooing the heart of the night with
its mystic notes, and the moonlight
shimmering on drowsy trees and
slumbering foliage that not a breath
in all the wide air stirred.</p>

<p>“There is a soft quiet in our
English nights, a kind of home
feeling about them, that makes them
very lovable, and that I have experienced
nowhere else,” said Kenneth.</p>

<p>“Oh! I am so glad to hear you
say that, Mr. Goodal.”</p>

<p>“May I ask why, Miss Herbert?”</p>

<p>“Well, I hardly know. Because,
I suppose, I am so very English.”</p>

<p>“So is Tupper, and Fairy swears
by Tupper. At least she would, if
she swore at all,” remarked her
brother, whose hair was pulled for
his pains.</p>

<p>“Were you ever abroad, Miss
Herbert?”</p>

<p>“Never; papa wished to take me
often, but I refused, because I suppose
again I am so very English.”</p>

<p>“Too English to face sea-sickness,”
said her brother.</p>

<p>“I believe the fault is mine, Mr.
Goodal,” said her father. “You
see the gout never leaves me for
long together. I am liable at any
time to an attack; and gout is a
bad companion on foreign travel.
It is bad enough at home, as Nellie
finds, who insists on being my only
nurse; and I am so selfish that I
have not the heart to let her go,
and I believe she has hardly the
heart to leave me.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t wish to go. Cousin
Edith goes every year, and we
have such battles when she comes
back. She cannot endure this
climate, she cannot endure the
people, she cannot endure the fashions,
the language is too harsh and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
grating for her ear, the cooking is
barbarous&mdash;every thing is bad. Now,
I would rather stay at home and
be happy in my ignorance than
learn such lessons as that,” said
honest Nellie.</p>

<p>“You would never learn such
lessons.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think so? But tell
us now, Mr. Goodal, do not you,
who have seen so much, find England
very dull?”</p>

<p>“Excessively. That is one of
its chief beauties. Dulness is one
of our national privileges; and Roger
here will tell you we pride
ourselves on it.”</p>

<p>“Kenneth would say that dulness
is only another word for what
you would call our beautiful home-life,”
said the gentleman appealed
to.</p>

<p>“Dulness indeed! I don’t find it
dull,” broke in Nellie, bridling up.</p>

<p>“No, the dairy and the kitchen;
the dinner and tea; the Priory on a
Sunday; the shopping excursions
into Leighstone, where there is
nothing to buy; the garden and the
vinery; the visits to Mrs. Jones
and Mrs. Knowles; to Widow
Wickham, who is blind; to Mrs.
Staynes, who is deaf, and whose
husband ran away from her because,
as he said, he feared that he
would rupture a blood-vessel in
trying to talk to her; the parish
school and the charity hospital,
make the life of a well-behaved
young English lady quite a round
of excitement. There are such
things, too, as riding to hounds,
and a ball once in a while, and
croquet parties, and picnics, and
the Eleusinian mysteries of the tea-table.
Who shall say that, with all
these opportunities for wild dissipation,
English country life is dull?”</p>

<p>“Roger wearies of Leighstone,
you perceive,” said my father.
“Well, I was restless once myself;
but the gout laid hold of me early
in life, and it has kept its hold.”</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Goodal, in all your
wanderings, tell me where you have
seen anything so delightful as this?
Have you seen a ruin more venerable
than S. Wilfrid’s, nodding to
sleep like a gray old monk on the
top of the hill there? Every stone
of it has a history; some of them
gay, many of them grave. Look at
the Priory nestling down below&mdash;history
again. See how gently the
Leigh wanders away through the
country. Every cottage and farm
on its banks I know, and those in
them. Could you find a sweeter
perfume in all the world than steals
up from my own garden here,
where all the flowers are mine, and
I sometimes think half know me?
All around is beauty and peace,
and has been so ever since I was a
child. Why, then, should I wish
to wander?”</p>

<p>Something more liquid even than
their light glistened in Fairy’s eyes,
as she turned them on Kenneth at
the close. He seemed startled at
her sudden outburst, and, after a
moment, said almost gravely:</p>

<p>“You are right, Miss Herbert.
The beauty that we do not know
we may admire, but hardly love. It
is like a painting that we glance at,
and pass on to see something else.
There is no sense of ownership
about it. I have wandered, with a
crippled friend by my side, through
art galleries where all that was
beautiful in nature and art was
drawn up in a way to fascinate the
eye and delight the senses. Yet
my crippled friend never suffered
by contrast; never felt his deformity
there. Knowledge, association,
friendship, love&mdash;these are the great
beautifiers. The little that we can
really call our own is dearer to us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
than all the world&mdash;is our world, in
fact. An Italian sunset steals and
enwraps the senses into, as it were,
a third heaven. A London fog is
one of the most hideous things in
this world; yet a genuine Londoner
finds something in his native fog
dear to him as the sunset to the
Italian, and I confess to the barbarism
myself. On our arrival the
other day we were greeted by a
yellow, dense, smoke-colored fog,
such as London alone can produce.
It was more than a year since I had
seen one, and I enjoyed it. I
breathed freely again, for I was at
home. You will understand, then,
how I appreciate your enthusiasm
about Leighstone; and if Leighstone
had many like Miss Herbert, I can
well understand why its people
should be content to stay at home.”</p>

<p>Nellie laughed. “I am afraid,
Mr. Goodal, that you have brought
back something more than your
taste for fogs and your homely
Saxon from Italy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, a more rooted love for my
own land, a truer appreciation of
my countrymen, and more ardent
admiration of my fair countrywomen.”</p>

<p>“Ah! now you are talking Italian.
But, honestly, which country
do you find the most interesting
of all you have seen?”</p>

<p>“My own, Miss Herbert.”</p>

<p>“The nation of shop-keepers!”
ejaculated I.</p>

<p>“Of Magna Charta,” interposed
my father, who, ready enough to
condemn his age and his country
himself, was Englishman enough to
allow no other person to do so with
impunity.</p>

<p>“Of hearth and home, of cheerful
firesides and family circles,”
added Nellie.</p>

<p>“Of work-houses and treadmills,”
I growled.</p>

<p>“Of law and order, of civil and
religious liberty,” corrected my father.</p>

<p>“Which are of very recent introduction
and very insecure tenure,”
added I.</p>

<p>“They formed the corner-stone
of the great charter on which our
English state is built&mdash;a charter
that has become our glory and the
world’s envy.”</p>

<p>“To be broken into and rifled
within a century; to be set under
the foot of a Henry VIII. and pinned
to the petticoat of an Elizabeth;
to be mocked at in the death of a
Mary, Queen of Scots, and a Charles;
to be thrown out of window by a
Cromwell. Our charters and our
liberties! Oh! we are a thrifty
race. We can pocket them all
when it suits our convenience, and
flaunt them to the world on exhibition-days.
Our charter did not
save young Raymond Herbert his
neck for sticking to his faith during
the Reformation, though I believe
that same charter provided above
all things that the church of God
should be free; and a Chief-Justice
Herbert sat on the bench and pronounced
sentence on the boy, not
daring to wag a finger in defence
of his own flesh and blood. Of
course the Catholic Church was
not the church of God, for so the
queen’s majesty decreed; and to
Chief-Justice Herbert we owe these
lands, such of them as were saved.
Great heaven! we talk of nobility&mdash;English
nobility; the proudest
race under the sun. The proudest
race under the sun, who would
scorn to kiss the Pope’s slipper,
grovelled in the earth, one and all
of them, under the heel of an Elizabeth,
and the other day trembled at
the frown of a George the Fourth!”</p>

<p>I need not dwell on the fact
that in those days I had a particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
fondness for the sound of my
own voice. I gloried in what
seemed to me startling paradoxes,
and flashes of wisdom that loosened
bolts and rivets of prejudice, shattered
massive edifices of falsehood,
undermined in a twinkling social
and moral weaknesses, which, of
course, had waited in snug security
all these long years for my coming
to expose them to the scorn of a
wondering world. What a hero I
was, what a trenchant manner I had
of putting things, what a keen intellect
lay concealed under that
calm exterior, and what a deep
debt the world would have owed
me had it only listened in time to
my Cassandra warnings, it will be
quite unnecessary for me to point
out.</p>

<p>“I suppose I ought to be very
much ashamed of myself,” said
Kenneth good-humoredly; “but I
still confess that I find my own
country the most interesting of any
that I have seen. It may be that
the very variety, the strange contradictions
in our national life and
character, noticed by our radical
here, are in themselves no small
cause for that interest. If we have
had a Henry VIII., we have had an
Alfred and an Edward; if we have
had an Elizabeth, we have also had
a Maud; if our nobles cowered before
a woman, they faced a man at
Runnymede, and at their head were
English churchmen, albeit not English
churchmen of the stamp of
to-day. If we broke through our
charter, let us at least take the
merit of having restored something
of it, although it is somewhat mortifying
to find that centuries of
wandering and of history and discovery
only land us at our old
starting-point.”</p>

<p>“I give in. Bah! we are spoiling
the night with history, while all
nature is smiling at us in her beautiful
calm.”</p>

<p>“Ah! you have driven away the
nightingale; it sings no more,” said
Fairy.</p>

<p>“Surely some one can console
us for its absence,” said Kenneth,
glancing at Nellie.</p>

<p>“I do not understand Italian,”
she laughed back.</p>

<p>“Your denial is a confession of
guilt. I heard Roger call you Fairy.
There be good fairies and bad.
You would not be placed among the
bad?”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because all the bad fairies are
old.”</p>

<p>“And ride on broomsticks,” added
I.</p>

<p>Unlike her brother, who had not
a note of music in him, Fairy had
a beautiful voice, which had had
the additional advantage of a very
careful cultivation. She sang us a
simple old ballad that touched our
hearts; and when that was done,
we insisted on another. Then the
very trees seemed to listen, the flowers
to open as to a new sunlight,
and shed their sweetness in sympathy,
as she sang one of those ballads
of sighs and tears, hope and
despair and sorrowful lamentation,
caught from the heart of a nation
whose feelings have been stirred to
the depths to give forth all that was
in them in the beautiful music that
their poet has wedded to words.
The ballad was “The Last Rose of
Summer,” and as the notes died
away the foliage seemed to move and
murmur with applause, while after a
pause the nightingale trilled out
again its wonderful song in rivalry.
There was silence for a short time,
which was broken by Kenneth saying:</p>

<p>“I must break up Fairy-land,
and go back to the Black Bull.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>But of this we would not hear. It
was agreed that Kenneth should
take up his quarters with us. The
conversation outlasted our usual
hours at Leighstone. Kenneth sustained
the burden; and with a wonderful
grace and charm he did so.
He had read as well as travelled,
and more deeply and extensively
than is common with men of his
years; for his conversation was full
of that easy and delightful illustration
that only a student whose sharp
angles have been worn off by contact
with the world outside his study
can command and gracefully use,
leaving the gem of knowledge that
a man possesses, be it small or great,
perfect in its setting. Much of
what he related was relieved by
some shrewd and happy remark of
his own that showed him a close
observer, while a genial good-nature
and tendency to take the best possible
view of things diffused itself
through all. It was late when my
father said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Goodal, you have tempted
me into inviting an attack of my
old enemy by sitting here so long.
There is no necessity for your going
to-morrow, is there, since you
are simply on a walking tour?
Roger is a great rambler, and there
are many pretty spots about Leighstone,
many an old ruin that will
repay a visit. Indeed, ruins are the
most interesting objects of these
days. My walking days, I fear, are
over. A visitor is a Godsend to us
down here, and, though you ramblers
soon tire of one spot, there is
more in Leighstone than can be
well seen in a day.”</p>

<p>Thus pressed, he consented, and
our little party broke up.</p>

<p>“Are you an owl!” I asked
Kenneth, as my father and sister retired.</p>

<p>“Somewhat,” he replied, smiling.</p>

<p>“Then come to my room, and
you shall give your to-whoo to my
to-whit. I was born an owl, having
been introduced into this world, I
am informed, in the small hours;
and the habits of the species cling
to me. Take that easy-chair and
try this cigar. These slippers will
ease your feet. Though not a
drinking man, properly so called, I
confess to a liking for the juice of
the grape. The fondness for it is
still strong in the sluggish blood of
the Norse, and I cannot help my
blood. Therefore, at an hour like
this, a night-cap will not hurt us.
Of what color shall it be? Of the
deep claret tint of Bordeaux, the
dark-red hue of Burgundy, or the
golden amber of the generous Spaniard?
Though, as I tell you, not a
drinking man, I think a good cigar
and a little wine vastly improves
the moonlight, provided the quantity
be not such as to obscure the
vision of eye or brain. That is not
exactly a theory of my own. It
was constantly and deeply impressed
upon me by a very reverend
friend of mine, with whom I read
for a year. Indeed I fear his
faith in port was deeper than his
faith in the Pentateuch. The drunkard
is to me the lowest of animals,
ever has been, and ever will be.
Were the world ruled&mdash;as it is
scarcely likely to be just yet&mdash;by
my suggestions, the fate of the
Duke of Clarence should be the
doom of every drunkard, with only
this difference; that each one
be drowned in his own favorite liquor,
soaked there till he dissolved,
and the contents ladled out and
poured down the throat of whoever,
by any accident, mistook the gutter
for his bed. You will pardon my
air; in my own room I am supreme
lord and master. Kenneth, my
boy, I like you. I feel as though I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
had known you all my life. That
must have been the reason for my
unruly, ungracious, and unmannerly
explosion down-stairs at dinner.
I have an uncontrollable habit of
breaking out in that style sometimes,
and the effect on my father,
whom I need not tell you I love
and revere above all men living, is
what you see.”</p>

<p>He smoked in silence a few seconds,
and then, turning on me, suddenly
asked:</p>

<p>“Where did you learn your theology?”</p>

<p>The question was the last in the
world that would have presented itself
to me, and was a little startling,
but put in too earnest a manner for
a sneer, and too kindly to give offence.
I answered blandly that I
was guiltless of laying claim to any
special theology.</p>

<p>“Well, your opinions, then&mdash;the
faith, the reasons, on which you
ground your life and views of life.
Your conversation at times drifts
into a certain tone that makes me
ask. Where or what have you
studied?”</p>

<p>“Nowhere; nothing; everywhere;
everything; everybody; I
read whatever I come across. And
as for theology&mdash;for my theology,
such as it is&mdash;I suppose I am chiefly
indebted to that remarkably clever
organ of opinion known as the
<cite>Journal of the Age</cite>.”</p>

<p>A few whiffs in silence, and then
he said:</p>

<p>“I thought so.”</p>

<p>“What did you think?”</p>

<p>“That you were a reader of the
<cite>Journal of the Age</cite>. Most youngsters
who read anything above a
sporting journal or a sensational
novel are. I have been a student
of it myself&mdash;a very close student.
I knew the editor well. We were
at one time bosom friends. He
took me in training, and I recognized
the symptoms in you at once.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“The <cite>Journal of the Age</cite>&mdash;and it
has numerous admirers and imitators&mdash;is,
in these days, the ablest organ
of a great and almost universal
worship of an awful trinity that
has existed since man was first created;
and the name of that awful
trinity is&mdash;the devil, the world,
and the flesh.”</p>

<p>I stared at him in silent astonishment.
All the gayety of his manner,
all its softness, had gone, and
he seemed in deadly earnest, as he
went on:</p>

<p>“This worship is not paraded in
its grossest form. Not at all. It is
graced by all that wit can give and
undisciplined intellect devise. It
has a brilliant sneer for Faith, a
scornful smile for Hope, and a chill
politeness for Charity. I revelled in
it for a time. Heaven forgive me!
I was happy enough to escape.”</p>

<p>“With what result?”</p>

<p>“Briefly with this: with the conviction
that man did not make this
world; that he did not make himself,
or send himself into it; that
consequently he was not and could
never be absolutely his own master;
that he was sent in and called
out by Another, by a Greater than
he, by a Creator, by a God. I became
and am a Catholic, to find
that what for a time I had blindly
worshipped were the three enemies
against whom I was warned to
fight all the days of my life.”</p>

<p>“And the <cite>Journal of the Age</cite>?”</p>

<p>“The editor cut me as soon as
he found I believed in God in preference
to himself. He is the
fiercest opponent of Papal Infallibility
with whom I ever had the
honor of acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“I cannot say that your words
and the manner in which you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
speak them do not impress me.
Still, it never occurred to me that
so insignificant a being as Roger
Herbert was worthy the combined
attack of the three formidable adversaries
you have named. What
have the devil, the world, and the
flesh to do with me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is the difficulty, not
only with Roger Herbert, but with
everybody else. It does seem
strange that influences so powerful
and mysterious should be for ever
ranged against such wretched little
beings as we are, whom a toothache
tortures and a fever kills. Yet
surely man’s life on earth is not all
fever and its prevention, toothache
and its cure, or a course of eating,
doctoring, and tailoring. If we believe
at all in a life that can never
end, in a soul, surely that is something
worth thought and care. An
eternal life that must range itself on
one side or the other seems worthy
of a struggle between the powers
of good and evil, if good and evil
there be. Nay, man is bound of
his own right, of his own free will,
of his very existence, to choose between
one and the other, to be good
or be bad, and not stumble on listlessly
as a thing of chance, tossed
at will from one to the other. We
do not sufficiently realize the greatest
of our obligations. We should
feel disgraced if we did not pay
our tailor or our wine-merchant;
but such a thought never presents
itself to us when the question concerns
God or the devil, or that part
of us that does not wear clothes
and does not drink wine.”</p>

<p>He had risen while he was speaking,
and spoke with an energy and
earnestness I had never yet witnessed
in any man. Whether right or
wrong, his view of things towered
so high above my own blurred and
crooked vision that I felt myself
crouch and grow small before him.
The watch-tower of his faith planted
him high up among the stars of
heaven, while I groped and struggled
far away down in the darkness.
Oh! if I could only climb up there
and stand with him, and see the
world and all things in it from that
divine and serene height, instead of
impiously endeavoring to build up
my own and others’ little Babel that
was to reach the skies and enable
us to behold God. But conversions
are not wrought by a few
sentences nor by the mere emotions
of the heart; not by Truth itself,
which is for ever speaking, for ever
standing before and confronting us,
its mark upon its forehead, yet we
pass it blindly by; for has it not
been said that “having eyes they
see not, and having ears they hear
not”?</p>

<p>“Kenneth,” I said, stretching out
my hand, which he clasped in both
of his, “the subject which has been
called up I feel to be far too solemn
to be dismissed with the sneer and
scoff that have grown into my
nature. Indeed, I always so regarded
it secretly; but perhaps the
foolish manner in which I have
hitherto treated it was owing somewhat
to the foolish people with
whom I have had to deal from my
boyhood. They give their reasons
about this, that, and the other as
parrots repeat their lesson, with
interjectory shrieks and occasional
ruffling of the poll, all after the
same pattern. You seem to me to be
in earnest; but, if you please, we
will say no more about it&mdash;at least
now.”</p>

<p>“As you please,” he replied.
“Here I am at the end of my cigar.
So good-night, my dear boy. Well,
you have had my to-whit to your
to-whoo.”</p>

<p>And so a strange day ended. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
sat thinking some time over our
conversation. Kenneth’s observations
opened quite a new train of
thought. It had never occurred
to me before that life was a great
battle-field, and that all men were,
as it were, ranged under two standards,
under the folds of which they
were compelled to fight. Everything
had come to me in its place.
A man might have his private
opinions on men and things, as he
collects a private museum for his
own amusement; but in the main
one lived and died, acted and
thought, passed through and out of
life, in much the same manner as
his neighbor, not inquiring and not
being inquired into too closely.
Life was made for us, and we lived
it much in the same way as we
learned our alphabet, we never
knew well how, or took our medicine,
in the regulation doses. Sometimes
we were a little rebellious,
and suffered accordingly; that was
all. Excess on any side was a
bore to everybody else. It was
very easy, and on the whole not unpleasant.
We nursed our special
crotchets, we read our newspapers,
we watched our children at their
gambols, we chatted carelessly
away out on the bosom of the broad
stream along which we were being
borne so surely and swiftly into the
universal goal. Why should we
scan the sky and search beneath the
silent waters, trembling at storms
to come and treacherous whirlpools,
hidden sand-banks, and cruel rocks
on which many a brave bark had
gone down? Chart and compass
were for others; a pleasant sail only
for us. There was a Captain up
aloft somewhere; it was his duty
and not ours to see that all was
right and taut&mdash;ours to glide along
in slumbrous ease, between eternal
banks of regions unexplored; to
feast our eyes on fair scenes, and
lap our senses in musical repose.
That was the true life. Sunken
rocks, passing storms, mutinies
among the crew, bursting of engines&mdash;what
were such things to us? Had
we not paid our fares and made our
provision for the voyage, and was
not the Captain bound to land us
safely at our journey’s end, if he
valued his position and reputation?</p>

<p>The devil, the world, and the
flesh! What nightmare summoned
these up, and set them glaring horribly
into the eyes of a peaceful
British subject? What had the
devil to do with me or I with the
devil? What were the world and
the flesh? Take my father, now;
what had they to do with him?
Or Fairy? Why, her life was as
pure as that sky that smiled down
upon her with all its starry eyes.
Let me see; there were others, however,
who afforded better subjects
for investigation. Whenever you
want to find out anything disagreeable,
call on your friends and neighbors.
There was the Abbot Jones,
now; let us weigh him in the triple
scale. How fared the devil, the
world, and the flesh with the Abbot
Jones? He was, as I said to Kenneth,
a very genial man; he had
lived a good life, married into an
excellent family, paid his bills, had
a choice library, a good table, was
an excellent judge of cattle, and a
preacher whom everybody praised.
Abbot Jones was faultless! There
was not a flaw to be found in him
from the tip of his highly-polished
toe to the top of his highly-polished
head. He had a goodly income,
but he used it cautiously; for Clara
and Alice were now grown up, and
were scarcely girls to waste their
lives in a nunnery, like my cousins,
the daughters of Archdeacon Herbert,
who adored all that was sweetly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
mortifying and secluded, yet, by one
of those odd contradictions in female
and human nature generally,
never missed a fashion or a ball.
Yes, Abbot Jones was a good and
exemplary man. To be sure, he did
not walk barefoot or sandal-shod,
not alone among the highways,
where men could see and admire,
but into the byways of life, down
among the alleys of the poor, where
clustered disease, drunkenness, despair,
death; where life is but one
long sorrow. But then for what
purpose did he pay a curate, unless
to do just this kind of dirty, apostolic
work, while the abbot devoted
himself to the cares of his family,
the publication of an occasional
pamphlet, and that pleasant drawing-room
religion that finds its
perfection in good dinners, sage
maxims, and cautious deportment?
If the curate neglected his duty,
that was clearly the curate’s fault,
and not the abbot’s. If the abbot
were clothed, not exactly in purple,
but in the very best of broadcloth,
and fasted only by the doctor’s
orders, prayed not too severely,
fared sumptuously every day of his
life, he paid for every inch of cloth,
every ounce of meat, every drop
of that port for which his table
was famous; for he still clung to
the clerical taste for a wine that at
one time assumed a semi-ecclesiastical
character, and certain crumbs
from his table went now and then
to a stray Lazarus. Yes, he was a
faultless man, as the world went.
He did not profess to be consumed
with the zeal for souls. His life
did not aim at being an apostolic
one. He had simply adopted a
profitable and not unpleasant profession.
If a S. Paul had come,
straggling, footsore, and weary, into
Leighstone, and begun preaching
to the people and attacking shepherds
who guarded not their fold,
but quietly napped and sipped their
port, while the wolves of irreligion,
of vice and misery in every form,
entered in and rent the flock from
corner to corner, the abbot would
very probably have had S. Paul arrested
for a seditious vagrant and a
disturber of the public peace.</p>

<p>Take my uncle, the archdeacon;
what thought he of the world, the
flesh, and the devil? As for the
last-named enemy of the human
race, he did not believe in him. A
personal devil was to him simply
a bogy wherewith to frighten children.
It was the outgrowth of
mediæval superstition, a Christianized
version of a pagan fable. The
devil was a gay subject with Archdeacon
Herbert, who was the wittiest
and courtliest of churchmen. His
mission was up among the gods of
this world; his confessional ladies’
boudoirs, his penance an epigram, his
absolution the acceptance of an invitation
to dinner. He breathed in
a perfumed atmosphere; his educated
ear loved the rustle of silks; he
saw no heaven to equal a coach-and-four
in Rotten Row during the
season. It was in every way fitting
that such a man should sooner or
later be a bishop of the Church Established.
He was an ornament to
his class&mdash;a man who could represent
it in society as well as in the
pulpit, whose presence distilled dignity
and perfume, and whose views
were what are called large and liberal&mdash;that
is to say, no “views” at
all. What the three enemies had
to do with my uncle I could not
see. I could only see that he would
scarcely have been chosen as one
of The Twelve; but then who would
be chosen as one of The Twelve in
these days?</p>

<p>I went to the window and looked
out. The moon was going down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
behind S. Wilfrid’s, and Leighstone
was buried in gloomy shadow.
Down there below me in the
darkness throbbed thousands of
hearts resting a little in peaceful
slumber till the morning came to
wake them again to the toil and the
struggle, the pleasure and the pain,
the good and the evil, of another
day. The good and the evil. Was
there no good and evil waiting
down there by the bedside of every
one, to face them in the morning,
and not leave them until they returned
to that bedside at night?
Was there a great angel somewhere
up above in that solemn, silent,
ever-watchful heaven, with an open
scroll, writing down in awful letters
the good and the bad, the white
and the black, in the life of each
one of us? Were we worth this care,
weak little mortals, human machines,
that we were? What should
our good or our evil count against
the great Spirit, whom we are told
lives up above there in the passionless
calm of a fixed eternity? Did
we shake our puny fists for ever in
the face of that broad, bent heaven
that wrapped us in and overwhelmed
us in its folds, what effect would
it have? If we held them up in
prayer, what profited it? Who
of men could storm heaven or
search hell? And yet, as Kenneth
said, a life that could not end was
an awful thing. That the existence
we feel within us is never to cease;
that the power of discriminating
between good and evil, define
them, laugh at them or quibble
about them as we may, can never
die out of us; that we are irresistibly
impelled to one or the other;
that they are always knocking at
the door of our hearts, for we
feel them there; that they cannot
be blind influences, knowing not
when to come or when to go, but
the voices of keen intelligences
acting over the great universe,
wherever man lives and moves and
has his being; that they are not creations
of our own, for they are independent
of us; we may call evil
good and good wicked, but in the
end the good will show itself, and
the evil throw off its disguise in
spite of us&mdash;what does all this say
but that there is an eternal conflict
going on, and that, will he or will
he not, every man born into the
world must take a share in it?</p>

<p>That being so, search thine own
heart, friend. Leave thy uncle,
leave thy neighbor, and come back
to thyself. Let them answer for
their share; answer thou for thine.
Which is thy standard? It cannot
be both. What part hast thou
borne in the conflict? What giants
killed? What foes overcome?
Hast thou slain that doughty giant
within thee&mdash;thine own self? Is
there no evil in thee to be cast out?
No stain upon the scutcheon of thy
pure soul? No vanity, no pride, no
love of self above all and before
all, no worship of the world, no
bowing to Mammon or other strange
gods, not to mention graver blots
than all of these? Let thy neighbor
pass till all the dross is purged
out of thee. There is not a libertine
in all the world but would
wish all the world better, provided
he had not to become better with
it. Thy good wishes for others are
shared by all men alike, by the
worst as by the best. Begin at
home, friend, and root out and
build up there. Trim thy own garden,
cast out the weeds, water and
tend it well. The very sight of it
is heaven to the weary wayfarer
who, having wandered far away from
his own garden, sinks down at thy
side, begrimed with the dust of the
road and the smoke of sin. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
may tear him to pieces, you may
lacerate his soul, you may cast him,
bound hand and foot, into the outer
darkness, yet never touch his
heart. But he will stand afar off
and admire when he sees thy garden
blowing fair, and all the winds
of heaven at play there, all the dews
of heaven glistening there, all the
sunshine of heaven beaming there;
then will he come and creep close up
to thee, desiring to take off the shoes
from his feet, soiled with his many
wanderings in foul places. Then
for the first time he feels that he
has wandered from the way, will
see the stains upon him, and with
trembling fingers hasten to cast them
off, and, standing barefoot and humble
before Him who made thee pure,
falter out at length, “Lord, it is
good for us to be here.”</p>

<h3>CALDERON’S AUTOS SACRAMENTALES.<br />
<span class="smaller">CONCLUDED.<br />
II.</span></h3>

<h4>I. BALTASSAR’S FEAST.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></h4>

<p>Of all Calderon’s <i lang="es">autos</i>, this is the
one which has been the most generally
admired, both on account of
its intense dramatic power and
popular character.</p>

<p>It has been translated several
times into German (see note at end
of previous article on the <i lang="es">autos</i>),
and into English by Mr. MacCarthy.</p>

<p>The latter says in his preface:
“This <i lang="es">auto</i> must be classed with
those whose action relates directly
to the Blessed Sacrament, because
it puts before us, in the profanation
of the vases of the Temple by Baltassar,
a type of the desecration of
the Holy Sacrament, and symbolizes
to us, in the punishment that
follows this sacrilege, the magnitude
and sublimity of the Eucharistic
Mystery. Although this immediate
relation between the action of the
<i lang="es">auto</i> and the sacrament becomes
only manifestly clear in the last
scene, nevertheless all the preceding
part, which is only preparing
us for the final catastrophe,
stands in immediate connection
with it, and, through it, with the action
of the <i lang="es">auto</i>. The wonderful
simplicity of this relation, and the
lively dramatic treatment of the
subject, allow us to place this <i lang="es">auto</i>,
justly, in the same category with
those that, comparatively speaking,
are easy to be understood, and
which, like <cite>The Great Theatre of the
World</cite>, have especial claims upon
popularity, even if many of its details
contain very deep allusions,
the meaning of which, at first sight,
is not very intelligible.”</p>

<p>The <i lang="es">auto</i> opens in the garden
of Baltassar’s palace with a scene
between Daniel and Thought, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
dressed in a coat of many colors,
represents the Fool.</p>

<p>After a long description of his
abstract self he states that he has
this day been assigned to King Baltassar’s
mind, and ironically remarks
that he, Thought, is not the
only fool, and apologizes for his
rudeness in not listening to Daniel:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“It were difficult to try</div>
<div class="verse">To keep up a conversation,</div>
<div class="verse">We being in our separate station,</div>
<div class="verse">Wisdom thou, and Folly I.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Daniel answers that there is no
reason why they should not converse,
for the sweetest harmony is
that which proceeds from two different
chords.</p>

<p>Thought hesitates no longer, and
informs Daniel that he is thinking
of the wedding which Babylon celebrates
this day with great rejoicings.
The groom is King Baltassar,
son and heir of Nabuchodonosor;
the happy bride the fair Empress
of the East, Idolatry herself.</p>

<p>That the king is already wedded
to Vanity is no hindrance, as his
law allows him a thousand wives.</p>

<p>Daniel breaks forth in lamentations
for God’s people and the
unhappy kingdom; while clownish
Thought asks if Daniel himself is
interested in the ladies, since he
makes such an outcry over the
news, and insinuates that envy and
his captivity are the causes of his
grief.</p>

<p>With a flourish of trumpets enter
Baltassar and Vanity at one side,
and Idolatry, fantastically dressed,
at the other, with attendants, followers,
etc.</p>

<p>The king courteously welcomes
his new wife, who replies that it is
right that she should come to his
kingdom, since here first after the
Flood idolatry arose.</p>

<p>The king declares that his own
idea, his sole ambition, has been
to unite Idolatry and Vanity, and
then suddenly becomes absorbed in
thought while fondly regarding his
wives; to their questions as to the
cause of his suspense he answers
that, fired by their beauty, he wishes
to relate the wondrous story of his
conquests.</p>

<p>Wonderful indeed is the story
which follows, extending, in the
original, through three hundred and
fifty uninterrupted lines.</p>

<p>In the introduction the king relates
the strange fate of his father,
Nabuchodonosor, whose worthy
successor he declares himself to be,
and describes his vaulting ambition,
which will not be satisfied until he
is the sole ruler over all the region
of Senaar, which beheld the building
of the Tower of Babel; this
leads to an account of the Deluge,
so poetical and characteristic that
we give its finest portion here:<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<div class="verse">“First began a dew as soft</div>

<div class="verse">Rushed upon the prostrate shore,</div>
<div class="verse">With loud neighing to o’errun it.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The ark alone is saved, and Nimrod
resolves to anticipate a second
Deluge, and erect a more ambitious
refuge. The building of the Tower
of Babel and the Confusion of
Tongues then follow, and the king
closes his long monologue with the
determination to rebuild Nimrod’s
tower, urged to the task by the
opportune conjunction of Idolatry
and Vanity.</p>

<p>These express their gratification
at this lofty scheme, and offer to
perpetuate the fame of his great
deeds.</p>

<p>The king, exulting, exclaims:
“Who shall break this bond?”</p>

<p>Daniel, advancing, “The hand
of God!” and returns the same
answer to the king’s angry question,
“What can save thee from my
power or defend thee?”</p>

<p>Baltassar is profoundly moved,
but spares Daniel because Vanity
loathes the captive and Idolatry
disdains his religion.</p>

<p>In the fourth scene the prophet
addresses the Most High, and cries:
“Who can endure these offences,
these pretences of Vanity and displays
of Idolatry? Who will end
so great an evil?”</p>

<p>“I will,” answers Death, who enters,
wearing a sword and dagger,
and dressed symbolically in a cloak
covered with figures of skeletons.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Death’s answer in the following
monologue is most impressive and
beautiful. Our space, unfortunately,
will let us quote but a part:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Daniel, thou Prophet of the God of Truth,</div>
<div class="verse">I am the end of all who life begin,</div>
<div class="verse">The drop of venom in the serpent’s tooth,</div>
<div class="verse">The cruel child of envy and of sin.</div>
<div class="verse">Abel first showed the world’s dark door uncouth,</div>
<div class="verse">But Cain threw wide the door, and let me in;</div>
<div class="verse">Since then I’ve darkened o’er life’s checker’d path,</div>
<div class="verse">The dread avenger of Jehovah’s wrath.</div>
<div class="verse">… The proudest palace that supremely stands,</div>
<div class="verse">’Gainst which the wildest winds in vain may beat;</div>

<div class="verse">All are but easy triumphs of my hands,</div>
<div class="verse">All are but humble spoils beneath my feet;</div>
<div class="verse">If against <em>me</em> no palace-wall is proof,</div>
<div class="verse">Ah! what can save the lowly cottage-roof?</div>
<div class="verse">Beauty, nor power, nor genius, can survive,</div>
<div class="verse">Naught can resist my voice when I sweep by;</div>

<div class="verse">Yea, and so quickly shall my service run</div>
<div class="verse">That ere the word is said the deed is done!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Death then recounts some of his
past achievements to prove his
readiness to inflict punishment on
the king.</p>

<p>Daniel, however, expressly forbids
him to kill Baltassar, and gives
him leave only to awaken him to a
sense of coming woe and the fact
that he is mortal.</p>

<p>This Death does by appearing to
the king and showing him a small
book lost by him some time before
(<i>i.e.</i>, the remembrance of his mortality,
which he had forgotten), in
which is written his debt to Death.</p>

<p>He leaves the terror-stricken
monarch with an admonition to remember
his obligation.</p>

<p>Thought, hovering between Vanity
and Idolatry, soon, however, effaces
the impression left by the terrible
visitor.</p>

<p>The king and Thought, lulled by
their combined flatteries, fall asleep,
while Death enters and delivers the
following monologue, which, as Mr.
MacCarthy truly says, “belongs unquestionably
to the deepest and
most beautiful poetry that has ever
flown from the pen of Calderon”:</p>

<div class="verse">And can a man this Image, then, adore?</div>
<div class="verse">Since Baltassar here doth sleep,</div>
<div class="verse">Since he hath the poison drank,</div>
<div class="verse">Since he treads oblivion’s blank,</div>
<div class="verse">Since no more his pulses leap,</div>
<div class="verse">Since the lethargy is deep,</div>
<div class="verse">Since, in horror and confusion,</div>
<div class="verse">To all other sights’ exclusion,</div>

<div class="verse">Let him sleep, and never waken:</div>
<div class="verse">Be his body and soul o’ertaken</div>
<div class="verse">By the eternal slumber.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>(He draws his sword, and is
about to kill him.)</p>

<p>Daniel rushes in and saves the
sleeper, who is dreaming a mysterious
vision, which is visibly represented
to the spectators.</p>

<p>The king on awakening is captivated,
as usual, by Idolatry, who
proposes to him a magnificent feast,
in which shall be used the sacred
vessels carried away from Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The feast is prepared; the table
is brought in, on which are displayed
the sacred vessels; the attendants
begin serving the banquet, while
Thought plays the court-fool.</p>

<p>In the midst of the revelry Death
enters, disguised as one of the
servants, and, when the king calls
for wine, presents him with one of
the golden goblets from the table,
with a mysterious aside referring to
the Lord’s Supper, where the cup
contains both death and life, as it is
drunk worthily or unworthily.</p>

<p>The king rises and gives the
toast: “For ever, Moloch, god
of the Assyrians, live!”</p>

<p>A great clap of thunder is heard,
darkness settles on the feast, and a
fiery hand writes upon the wall the
fatal “<span class="smcap">Mane</span>, <span class="smcap">Thecel</span>, <span class="smcap">Phares</span>.”</p>

<p>Idolatry, Vanity, and Thought in
turn fail to interpret the mysterious
words, and the first named suggests
that Daniel should be summoned.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>The prophet comes and explains
the hidden meaning of the words,
declaring that God’s wrath has been
aroused by the misuse of the sacred
vessels, which, until the law of
grace reigns on earth, foreshow the
Blessed Sacrament.</p>

<p>Baltassar and his wives tremble
at the solemn words. Thought, an
expression of the reproaches of his
master’s conscience, turns against
the king, who laments the desertion
of his friends in the hour of need.</p>

<p>Death, during this scene, has been
approaching nearer and nearer, and
now draws his sword and stabs the
unhappy monarch, who cries:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“This is death, then!</div>
<div class="verse">Was the venom not sufficient</div>
<div class="verse">That I drank of?”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1"><span class="smcap">Death.</span> “No; that venom</div>
<div class="verse">Was the death of the soul; the body’s</div>
<div class="verse">This swift death-stroke representeth.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The king, struggling with Death,
is forced to confess:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These are his last words. Idolatry
awakens from her dream, and longs
to see the light of the law of grace
now while the written law reigns.</p>

<p>Death declares that it is foreshadowed
in Gedeon’s fleece, in the
manna, in the honey-comb, in the
lion’s mouth, and in the shew-bread.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The scene opens to the sound
of solemn music; a table is seen
arranged as an altar, with a monstrance
and chalice in the middle,
and two wax candles on each side.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es">auto</i> closes with Idolatry’s
declaration that she is transformed
into <em>Latria</em>, and the usual personal
address to the audience.</p>

<h4>II. THE PAINTER OF HIS OWN DISHONOR.</h4>

<p>We have already remarked that
the <i lang="es">auto El Pintor de su Deshonra</i>
is a <em>replica</em> of a secular play bearing
the same title.</p>

<p>It will not be out of place to give
a short analysis of the latter, premising
that it is one of the greatest
of Calderon’s tragedies.</p>

<p>In the first act the Governor of
Gaeta welcomes to his residence his
friend Don Juan Roca, whose young
wife, Seraphine, soon becomes intimate
with the governor’s daughter,
Portia, to whom she reveals the
secret that she has been ardently
loved by Portia’s brother, Don
Alvaro, whose love she has as
ardently returned.</p>

<p>News, however, was received of
his shipwreck and death, and she
finally yielded to her father’s urgent
requests, and gave her hand to Don
Juan.</p>

<p>The unhappy lady faints while
reciting her griefs, and Portia hastens
for aid. At this moment a
stranger enters, perceives the unconscious
lady, and bends over her
with an expression of the warmest
interest. Seraphine opens her eyes,
and with the cry “Alvaro!” faints
again.</p>

<p>Her old lover, saved from the
waves, has returned to find her
another’s wife.</p>

<p>From this moment begins a
struggle between love and duty,
depicted with all the tenderness
and power of which the poet was
capable.</p>

<p>Seraphine attempts with all her
strength to master her love for
Alvaro, and tells him, with forced
coolness, how much she is attached
to her husband by duty and inclination.</p>

<p>During this interview a cannon
is heard&mdash;the signal announcing the
approaching departure of Don
Juan’s ship. Seraphine withdraws
to follow him to their home in
Spain, and leaves Alvaro in a state
of utter hopelessness.</p>

<p>The second act reveals to us Don
Juan (an enthusiastic lover of art)
in his home in Barcelona, painting
his wife’s portrait.</p>

<p>The remembrance of the past
seems banished from Seraphine’s
heart, and everything indicates a
state of peace and happiness.</p>

<p>Don Juan withdraws a moment,
when a sailor enters the room.</p>

<p>It is Don Alvaro, who, unable to
forget his love, has followed Seraphine
to Barcelona. He overwhelms
her with his affection; but she
shows him so firmly and eloquently
that his pleading is in vain that he
in turn resolves to conquer his passion
and leave her for ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>He still lingers near, but makes
no attempt to approach her again.</p>

<p>One day, during the Carnival,
Don Juan’s villa takes fire. Seraphine
is borne insensible from the
house by her husband, who confides
her to Don Alvaro, whom he does
not, of course, recognize, and returns
to help the others who are in
danger.</p>

<p>Don Alvaro, meanwhile, is left
with Seraphine in his arms. His
love revives stronger than ever in
the terrible temptation, and he
bears the still insensible Seraphine
to his ship, and makes sail with the
greatest haste.</p>

<p>Don Juan does not return until
the ship is under way, discovers too
late that he has been deceived, and
throws himself into the sea in order
to overtake the fugitives.</p>

<p>In the last act we find Don Juan
at Gaeta, disguised as an artist, in
order to obtain more easily access
into private houses, and discover
who has stolen his wife.</p>

<p>He is introduced to Prince Urbino,
who commissions him to paint
the portrait of a beautiful woman
whom he has seen at a neighboring
forester’s house, which he visits in
order to meet Portia secretly.</p>

<p>The same place has been chosen
by Don Alvaro to conceal Seraphine,
who is the beautiful lady who
has attracted the prince’s attention.</p>

<p>Don Juan repairs to the appointed
spot, and erects his easel near
a window, through the blinds of
which he can see, unnoticed, the
fair one.</p>

<p>The artist discovers, with feelings
which can be imagined, his wife
asleep in the garden. She murmurs
words which prove her innocence.
But this cannot save her; she must
be sacrificed to remove the stain on
her husband’s honor.</p>

<p>Don Juan expresses his feelings
in a most powerful soliloquy, when
Alvaro enters and embraces the
sleeping Seraphine. At that instant
two shots are heard, and the innocent
and guilty fall bleeding to the
ground.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es">auto</i> founded on the above
play is, in the opinion of no less a
critic than Wilhelm Val Schmidt,
the first of its class, and withal
much less technical than is usual
with these plays.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la">dramatis personæ</i> include
the Artist, the World, Love, Lucifer,
Sin, Grace, Knowledge, Nature
(<i>i.e.</i>, human nature at first in a
state of innocence), Innocence, and
the Will (<i>i.e.</i>, free-will).</p>

<p>The first car represents a dragon,
which opens and discloses Lucifer,
whose first speech proves the
trite remark about the devil quoting
Scripture; for he immediately
proceeds to cite Jeremias and David,
who alluded to him as the dragon.</p>

<p>He then summons Sin, and repeats
to her his partly-known history,
which contains some singular
ideas.</p>

<p>He was the favorite of the Father
in his former home, where he saw,
before the original existed, the portrait
of so rare a beauty that, inflamed
with love, and to prevent
the Prince from marrying her, he
rebelled, and, placing himself at the
head of the other discontented
spirits, was defeated and doomed
to perpetual exile and darkness.</p>

<p>So far Sin is acquainted with
the story; but from this point all is
new to her.</p>

<p>The greatest of Lucifer’s sufferings
arises from his envy of the
Prince, who is all that is wise and
lovely: a learned theologian, legislator,
philosopher, physician, logician,
astrologist, mathematician,
architect&mdash;“witness the palace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the world”&mdash;geometrician, rhetorician,
musician, and poet.</p>

<p>But none of these qualities so enrages
and astonishes Lucifer as the
Prince’s talent for painting. He
has already been engaged six days
on a landscape. At the beginning
the ground of the canvas was so
bare and rough that he only drew
on it the outline in shadowy figures.
The first day he gave it light; the
second day he introduced heaven
and earth, dividing the waters and
the firmament; the third day, seeing
the earth so arid and bare, he
painted flowers in it and fruits, and
the fourth day the sun and moon.
He filled, the fifth day, the air and
waters with birds and fishes; and
this sixth day he has covered the
landscape with various animals.</p>

<p>Nothing of all this astonishes
Lucifer so much as the Prince’s intention
to embody in a palpable
form the ideal which was the cause
of Lucifer’s fall.</p>

<p>The divine Artist has himself
chosen the colors and selected clay
and occult minerals, which Lucifer
fears a breath may animate: “Since
if a breath can dissipate dust, I suspect,
I lament, I fear, that dust may
live by the inspiration of a breath.”</p>

<p>Animated by this fear, Lucifer
has summoned Sin to aid him in
destroying this image, so that the
Prince may be The Painter of his
own Dishonor.</p>

<p>A palace appears, and near the
entrance the painting on an easel.
Lucifer and Sin retire; for the Artist,
accompanied by the Virtues, comes
to put a careful hand to his work.</p>

<p>Sin knows not where to conceal
herself. Lucifer bids her hide in a
cave in the bank of a stream.</p>

<p>Sin answers that she is afraid of
the water, because she foresees that
it is to be (in the water of baptism)
the antidote to sin.</p>

<p>The flowers, grain, and vine all
terrify her, before which, as symbols
of some unknown sacrament, she
reverently bows.</p>

<p>She at last conceals herself in a
tree, which Lucifer calls from that
moment <em>the tree of death</em>.</p>

<p>The Artist enters, Innocence
bearing the palette, Knowledge the
mall-stick, and Grace the brushes.</p>

<p>He declares his intention to show
his power in the portrait his love
wishes to paint, and asks the attendant
Virtues to add their gifts to
Human Nature.</p>

<p>He proceeds to work, while the
Virtues call upon the sun, moon,
etc., to praise the Lord.</p>

<p>The Artist finishes his work by
breathing the breath of life into it.
The picture falls, and in its place appears
Human Nature, who expresses
most vividly her wonder at her creation,
and joins in the general anthem,
“Bless the Lord.” Lucifer
confesses that he and Sin are <i lang="fr">de
trop</i>, and they depart to seek some
disguise in which to return and
carry out their undertaking. While
the chorus repeats the praises of the
Lord, Human Nature naïvely asks,
“How can I bless him, if I do not
know him? Who will tell me who
He is or who I am?”</p>

<p>The Artist advances and answers
her question. Nature demands who
<em>he</em> is. “I am who am, and have been,
and am to be; and since thou hast
been created for Love’s spouse, let
thy love be grateful.”</p>

<p>“What command dost thou lay
on me, my Love? I will never
break it.”</p>

<p>“All that thou seest here is thine;
that tree alone is mine.”</p>

<p>Nature asks who can ever divert
her love, and is answered, “Thy
Free-will.”</p>

<p>“What new spirit and force was
created in my new being by that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
word, which told me that there was
something in me besides myself?
Voice, tell me, who is Free-will.”</p>

<p>Free-will appears as a rustic, and
answers, “I.”</p>

<p>Nature then proceeds to name
the various objects about her, accompanying
each name with some
appropriate remark, and is led quite
naturally to indulge in some boasting
at her dominion over such a
beautiful and varied kingdom.</p>

<p>This is the moment Lucifer and
Sin select to appear in the disguise
of rustics. The latter remains concealed
in the tree; the former introduces
himself to Human Nature as
a gardener, and says very gallantly
that he lost his last place on her account.</p>

<p>Nature hastens to turn a conversation
becoming somewhat personal
by asking what he is cultivating.</p>

<p>“That beautiful tree.”</p>

<p>“It is extremely lovely.”</p>

<p>“There is something more singular
about it than being merely lovely.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Earth, who brought it forth, can
tell thee.”</p>

<p>“I am earth, since I was formed
of earth; so I will tell the Earth to
keep me no longer in suspense.”</p>

<p>“Then speak to her, and thou
shalt see.”</p>

<p>“Mother Earth, what is this hidden
mystery?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sin.</span> “Eat, and thou shalt be as
God.”</p>

<p>Then follow the Fall and a powerful
scene depicting Nature’s confusion
and grief, as she is dragged
off by Satan as his slave, while Sin
claims Free-will as her prey.</p>

<p>The Artist enters and finds
Knowledge, Innocence, and Grace
in tears; the latter informs him of
the Fall.</p>

<p>He thus reproaches his creation
for her ingratitude: “What more
could I do for thee, my best design,
than form thee with my own hands?
I gave thee my image, a soul that
cost thee nothing, and yet thou desertest
me for my greatest enemy.”</p>

<p>He then pronounces the curse
upon Mankind and the Serpent, and
declares he will blot out the world,
the scene of their sin.</p>

<p>The clouds break and the sea
bursts its limits; the Earth trembles
and struggles with the waves, and
in agony calls on the Lord for
mercy.</p>

<p>In the midst of this confusion
of the elements Human Nature is
heard crying for help.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lucifer.</span> “Why callest thou for
aid, if I, the only one whom it behooves
to give it, delight in seeing
thee annihilated?”</p>

<p>Sin also makes the same declaration.
The World alone attempts to
save its queen.</p>

<p>At last the Artist casts her a plank,
saying, “Mortal, again see whom
thou hast deserted, and for whom;
since he whom thou hast offended
saves thee, and he whom thou
lovest abandons thee! One day
thou wilt know of what this plank,
fragment of a miraculous ark, is
symbol.”</p>

<p>The World, Nature, and Free-will
are saved; the latter enters,
bound with Sin, who declares that
Sin and Human Nature are so nearly
the same that one cannot go
anywhere without the other.</p>

<p>We have said anachronisms are
frequent; the poet here even makes
his characters jest about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Human Nature.</span> “Since here
there are no real persons, and Allegory
can traverse centuries in hours, it
seems to me that the salute the angels
are singing to this celestial
aurora declares in resounding
words…”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Music.</span> “In heaven and on
earth peace to man and glory to
God.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Free-will.</span> “The story has made
a fine jump from the Creation to
the Flood, and I think there is going
to be another, if I understand
that song aright&mdash;from the Deluge
to the Nativity!”</p>

<p>The chant continues, to the infinite
discomfort of Lucifer and Sin,
who at last determine in their rage
to disfigure Human Nature so that
her Creator himself could not recognize
her.</p>

<p>Lucifer holds her hands, while Sin
brands upon her brow the sign of
slavery.</p>

<p>Lucifer then commands the
World to remain on guard, and let
no one enter without careful scrutiny,
for fear lest the Artist may attempt
to avenge the wrong done him.</p>

<p>The Artist enters, accompanied
by Divine Love.</p>

<p>They are soon discovered by the
World, who exclaims: “Who goes
there?”</p>

<p>“Friends.”</p>

<p>“Your name?”</p>

<p>“A Man.”</p>

<p>“And the World, the faithful
sentinel of Sin, does not know how
thou hast entered here?”</p>

<p>“I did not come that Sin should
know me.”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> do not know thee.”</p>

<p>“So John will say.”</p>

<p>“By what door didst thou
enter?”</p>

<p>“By that of Divine Love, who
accompanies me.”</p>

<p>“What is thy office?”</p>

<p>“I was once an Artist in a certain
allegory, and must still be the
same.”</p>

<p>“Artist?”</p>

<p>“Yes, since I came to retouch a
figure of mine which an error has
blotted.”</p>

<p>“Since thou art a painter thou
canst do me a favor.…”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>The World then informs him that
there is a certain Spouse who has
been carried away from her husband,
and is now in the power of a
Tyrant, who is endeavoring to force
her to accompany him to another
world, the seat of his rule.</p>

<p>The Artist weeps, because he remembers
his own Spouse, whose fate
is similar to that of this one.</p>

<p>The world begs the Artist to
make a portrait of this fair disconsolate
one, that he (the World) may
wear it on his breast.</p>

<p>The Artist consents, and conceals
himself in order to work unobserved.</p>

<p>The World goes in search of Human
Nature, while the Artist looks
about for some hiding-place. Love
points to a cross near by, and says
that as the first offence was committed
in a tree, this one will witness
his vengeance.</p>

<p>The Artist calls for his colors,
and Love presents him with a box,
in opening which his hands are
stained a bloody red.</p>

<p>“Take this!”</p>

<p>“It is all carmine.”</p>

<p>“I have no other color.”</p>

<p>“Do not let it afflict thee, Love,
that blood must retouch what Sin
has blotted. The brushes!”</p>

<p>Love hands him three nails&mdash;“Here
they are!”</p>

<p>“How sharp and cruel! What
can be the canvas for such brushes!”</p>

<p>Love gives him a canvas in the
shape of a heart&mdash;“a heart.”</p>

<p>“Of bronze?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How I grieve to see it so hardened,
when I intended to form in it
a second figure! Give me the mall-stick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Love presents him with a small
lance. “Here it is.”</p>

<p>“The point is steel! Less cruel
instruments Innocence, Grace, and
Knowledge once gave me!”</p>

<p>“Be not astonished if these are
more cruel than those; for then thou
didst paint as God, and now as
Man!”</p>

<p>While the Artist is working Nature,
Free-will, and Sin enter, and
later Lucifer, who, wearied of Nature’s
continual lamentation, comes
to drag her to his realm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Artist.</span> “Why should I delay
my vengeance, seeing them together?
Give me, Love, the weapons which
I brought for this occasion!”</p>

<p>“Thy voice is the lightning, this
weapon only its symbol; but I deliver
it to thee with sorrow!”</p>

<p>“When my offended honor is so
deeply concerned?”</p>

<p>“I am Love, and <em>she</em> is weeping;
but I will direct my gaze to thy
wrongs, and without fail shall hit
the mark.”</p>

<p>“My hand cannot err, traitrous
adulterers, who conspired against
me; the honor of an insulted man
obliges me to this! I am the Painter
of his own Dishonor; die both
at one stroke!” (Fires. Lucifer
and Sin both fall.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Love.</span> “Thou hast hit Sin, and
not Human Nature!”</p>

<p>The Artist answers that it cannot
be said that his shot has failed, since
by this tree Nature lives, and Lucifer
and Sin are killed.</p>

<p>The Artist points to a fountain
of seven streams, and the Virtues,
and invites Human Nature to bathe
in the blood from his side, and be
restored to her original condition.</p>

<p>The <i lang="es">auto</i> closes with an expression
of gratitude from Nature, and
the usual allusion to the Sacrament
in whose honor the present festival
is celebrated.</p>

<h3>THE TRAGEDY OF THE TEMPLE.<br />
CONCLUDED.</h3>

<p>While the so-called King of
France was thus subjected to the
fierce and brutal caprice of one
man, there were thousands of loyal
hearts beating in pity for him, and
longing to liberate and crown him,
even at the price of their blood.
The faithful army of La Vendée
was fighting for him, and with a
courage and determination that
caused some anxiety among the
good patriots as to the possible issue
of the campaign. The movement
was held up to ridicule; the
young prince was mockingly styled
King of La Vendée. Nevertheless,
the republicans were alarmed,
and the hopes of the royalists
were reviving. The Simons were
discussing these matters one evening
over the newspaper, when Simon,
looking at the forlorn, broken-spirited
little monarch, whose
cause was thus creating strife and
bloodshed far beyond his dungeon’s
walls, exclaimed sneeringly: “I
say, little wolf-cub, they talk of setting
up the throne again, and putting
thee in thy father’s place;
what wouldst thou do to me if they
made thee king?” The boy raised
his dim blue eyes from the ground,
where they were now habitually
fixed, and replied: “I would forgive
thee!” Mme. Simon, in relating
this incident long after, said
that even her husband seemed for
a moment awed by the sublime
simplicity of the answer.</p>

<p>They were both of them sick and
tired of their office by this time;
she of the cruel work it involved,
he of the close confinement to
which it condemned them. He
tried to get released from his post,
and after some fruitless efforts succeeded.
On the 19th of January,
1794, they left the Temple. The
patriot shoemaker died six months
afterwards on the guillotine. He
had no successor, properly speaking,
in the Tower; in history he has
neither successor nor predecessor;
he stands alone, unrivalled and unapproachable,
as a type of the tiger-man,
a creature devoid of one
humane, redeeming characteristic.
Other men whose names have become
bywords of cruelty or ferocious
wickedness have at least had
the excuse of some all-absorbing
passion which, stifling reason and
every better instinct of their nature,
carried them on as by some overmastering
impulse; but Simon
could not plead even this guilty excuse.
His was no mad delirium of
passion, but a cold-blooded, deadly,
undying, unrelenting cruelty in the
execution of a murder that he had
no motive in pursuing except as a
means of adding a few coins more
to his salary. He entered on his
task of lingering assassination with
deliberate barbarity; he was not
stimulated by the sense of personal
wrong, by a thirst for revenge, by
any motive that could furnish the
faintest thread of extenuation.
He rose every morning and went
to his victim as other men rise and
go to their studies or their work. He
devoted all his energies, all his instincts,
to coolly inflicting torture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
on a beautiful, engaging, and innocent
little child. No, happily for
the world, he has no prototype in
its history; nor, for the honor of
humanity, has he ever found an
apologist. He is perhaps the only
monster of ancient or modern times
who has never found a sceptic or a
casuist to lift a voice in his behalf.
Nero and Trajan, Queen Elizabeth
and Louis XI., have had their
apologists; nay, even Judas has
found amongst the fatalists of some
German school an infatuated fellow-mortal
to attempt a defence of
the indefensible; but no man has
yet been known to utter a word of
excuse for the brutal jailer of Louis
XVII.</p>

<p>And yet his departure, though it
rid the helpless captive of an active,
ever-present barbarity, can
hardly be said, except negatively,
to have bettered his position. The
Convention decreed that it was essential
to the nation’s life and prosperity
that the little Capet should
be securely guarded; and as if the insane
precautions hitherto used were
not sufficient to secure a feeble, attenuated
child, he was removed to
a stronger and more completely
isolated dungeon, where henceforth
his waning life might die out quicker
and more unheard of. There was
only one window to the room, and
this was darkened by a thick wooden
blind, reinforced by iron bars
outside. The door was removed,
and replaced by a half-door with
iron bars above; these bars, when
unlocked, opened like a trap, and
through this food was passed to the
prisoner. The only light at night
was from a lamp fastened to the
wall opposite the iron grating.</p>

<p>Mme. Royale thus describes the
state of her brother in this new
abode, to which he was transferred&mdash;whether
by accident or design
we know not&mdash;on the anniversary
of his father’s death, January 21:
“A sickly child of eight years, he
was locked and bolted in a great
room, with no other resource than
a broken bell, which he never rang,
so greatly did he dread the people
whom its sound would have
brought to him; he preferred wanting
any and every thing to calling
for his persecutors. His bed had
not been stirred for six months, and
he had not strength to make it himself;
it was alive with bugs and
vermin still more disgusting. His
linen and his person were covered
with them. For more than a year
he had no change of shirt or stockings;
every kind of filth was allowed
to accumulate about him and in
his room; and during all that period
nothing had been removed.
His window, which was locked as
well as grated, was never opened,
and the infectious smell of this horrid
room was so dreadful that no
one could bear it for a moment.
He might indeed have washed himself&mdash;for
he had a pitcher of water&mdash;and
have kept himself somewhat
more clean than he did; but overwhelmed
by the ill-treatment he had
received, he had not resolution to
do so, and his illness began to deprive
him of even the necessary
strength. He never asked for anything,
so great was his dread of Simon
and his other keepers. He
passed his days without any kind
of occupation. They did not even
allow him light in the evening.
This situation affected his mind as
well as his body, and it is not surprising
that he should have fallen
into a frightful atrophy. The
length of time which he resisted
this treatment proves how good his
constitution must have originally
been.”</p>

<p>While the boy-king was slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
telling away his remnant of miserable
life in the dark solitude of the
Tower, thousands were being daily
immolated on the public places,
where the guillotine, insatiable and
indefatigable, despatched its cartloads
of victims. On the 10th of
May Mme. Elizabeth, the most revered
and saintly of all the long
roll of martyrs inscribed on that
bloody page, was sacrificed with
many other noble and interesting
women, amongst them the venerable
sister of M. de Malesherbes, the
courageous advocate of the king.
She was seventy-six years of age.
By a refinement of barbarity the
municipals who conducted the
“batch” obliged Mme. Elizabeth
to wait to see her twenty-five companions
executed before laying her
own head on the block. Each of
them, as they left the tumbrel, asked
leave to embrace her; she kissed
them with a smiling face, and said
a few words of encouragement to
each. “Her strength did not fail
her to the last,” says Mme. Royale,
“and she died with all the resignation
of the purest piety.”</p>

<p>Mme. Royale was henceforth left
in perfect solitude like her brother.
She thus describes her own and the
Dauphin’s life after the departure
of her beloved aunt, of whose death
she was happily kept in ignorance for
a long time: “The guards were often
drunk; but they generally left my
brother and me quiet in our respective
apartments until the 9th Thermidor.
My brother still pined in solitude
and filth. His keepers never
went near him but to give him his
meals; they had no compassion on
this unhappy child. There was one
of the guards whose gentle manners
encouraged me to recommend my
brother to his attention; this man
ventured to complain of the severity
with which the boy was treated, but
he was dismissed next day. I, at
least, could keep myself clean. I
had soap and water, and carefully
swept out my room every day. I
had no light.… They would not
give me any more books, but I had
some religious works and some
travels, which I read over and
over.”</p>

<p>The fall of Robespierre, which
rescued so many doomed heads
from the guillotine, and opened the
doors of their prison, had no such
beneficent effect on the fate of the
two royal children. It gave rise,
however, to some alleviation of their
sufferings. Immediately on the
death of his cowardly and “incorruptible”
colleague, Barras visited
the Tower, and dismissed the
whole set of commissaries of the
Commune, who were forthwith despatched
to have their heads cut
off next day, while a single guardian
was appointed in their place.</p>

<p>Laurent was the man’s name.
He had good manners, some education,
and, better than all, a human
heart. The lynxes of the Temple
eyed him askance; he was not of
their kin, this creole with the heart
of a man, and they mistrusted him.
It was not until two o’clock in the
morning that they conducted him
to the presence of his charge. He
tells us that when he entered the
ante-room of the dungeon he recoiled
before the horrible stench that
came from the inner room through
the grated door-way. Good heavens!
was this the outcome of the
reign of brotherhood which talked
so mightily of universal love and
liberty? It was in truth the most
forcible illustration of the gospel of
Sans-culottism that the world had
yet beheld. “Capet! Capet!”
cried the municipals in a loud voice.
But no answer came. More calling,
with threats and oaths, at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
brought out a feeble, wailing sound
like the cry of some dying animal.
But nothing more could threats, or
even an attempt at coaxing, elicit.
Capet would not move; would not
come forth and show himself to the
new tutor. Laurent took a candle,
and held it inside the bars of the
noxious cage; he beheld, crouching
on a bed in the furthest corner of
the dungeon, the body which was
confided to his guardianship. Sickened
with the sight, he turned away.
There was no appliance at hand for
forcing open the door or the grating.
Laurent at once sent in an
account of what he had seen, and
demanded that this remnant of
child-life, that he was appointed to
watch over, should be examined by
proper authority. The next day,
July 30, some members of the
Sûreté Générale came to the Tower.
M. de Beauchesne tells us what they
saw: “They called to him through
the grating; no answer. They
then ordered the door to be opened.
It seems there were no means
of doing it. A workman was called,
who forced away the bars of
the trap so as to get in his head,
and, having thus got sight of the
child, asked him why he did not
answer. Still no reply. In a
few minutes the whole door was
broken down, and the visitors entered.
Then appeared a spectacle
more horrible than can be conceived&mdash;a
spectacle which never again
can be seen in the annals of a
nation calling itself civilized, and
which even the murderers of Louis
XVI. could not witness without
mingled pity and fright. In a dark
room, exhaling a smell of death and
corruption, on a crazy, dirty bed, a
child of nine years old was lying
prostrate, motionless, and bent up,
his face livid and furrowed by want
and suffering, and his limbs half
covered with a filthy cloth and
trowsers in rags. His features,
once so delicate, and his countenance,
once so lively, denoted now
the gloomiest apathy&mdash;almost insensibility;
and his blue eyes,
looking larger from the meagreness
of the rest of his face, had lost all
spirit, and taken, in their dull immovability,
a tinge of gray and green.
His head and neck were eaten up
(<i lang="fr">rongés</i>) with purulent sores; his
legs, arms, and neck, thin and angular,
were unnaturally lengthened at
the expense of his chest and body.
His hands and feet were not human.
A thick paste of dirt stuck
like pitch over his temples, and his
once beautiful curls were full of
vermin, which also covered his
whole body, and which, as well as
bugs, swarmed in every fold of the
rotten bedding, over which black
spiders were running.… At the
noise of forcing the door the child
gave a nervous shudder, but barely
moved, not noticing the strangers.
A hundred questions were addressed
him; he answered none of them.
He cast a vague, wandering, unmeaning
look at his visitors, and at
this moment one would have taken
him for an idiot. The food they
had given him was still untouched;
one of the commissioners asked him
why he had not eaten it. Still no
answer. At last the oldest of the
visitors, whose gray hairs and paternal
tone seemed to make an impression
on him, repeated the question,
and he answered in a calm but resolute
tone: ‘Because I want to
die!’ These were the only words
which this cruel and memorable inquisition
extracted from him.”</p>

<p>Barras, the stuttering, pleasure-loving
noble of Provence, “a terror
to all phantasms, being himself of
the genus Reality”&mdash;Barras, who
had stood, like a bewildered, shipwrecked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
man while the storm-wind
was whirling blood-waves round
about him, now enters and beholds
the royal victim whom it has taken
nearly eighteen months of Simon
the Cordwainer’s treatment “to get
rid of”&mdash;perishing, but still alive in
his den of squalor, darkness, and
fright. His knees were so swollen
that his ragged trowsers had become
painfully tight. Barras ordered
them to be cut open, and found the
joints “prodigiously swollen and
livid.” One of the municipals, who
had formerly been a surgeon, was
permitted to dress the sores on the
head and neck; after much hesitation
a woman was employed to
wash and comb the child, and at
Laurent’s earnest remonstrance a
little air and light were admitted
into the damp room; the vermin
were expelled as far as could be, an
iron bed and clean bedding replaced
the former horrors in which the
boy had lain so many months, and
the grated door was done away with.
These were small mercies, after all,
and to which the vilest criminal
had a right. All the other rigors of
his prison were maintained. He
was still left to partial darkness and
complete solitude. Laurent, after
a while, wearied the municipals into
giving him leave to take him occasionally
for an airing on the leads.
The indulgence was perhaps welcome,
but the child showed no signs
of pleasure in it; he never spoke
or took the smallest notice of anything
he saw. Once only, when on
his way to the leads, he passed by
the wicket which conducted to the
rooms that his mother had occupied;
he recognized the spot at
once, gazed wistfully at the door,
and, clinging to Laurent’s arm, made
a sign for them to go that way. The
municipal who was on guard at the
moment saw what the poor little
fellow meant, and told him he had
mistaken the door; it was, he said,
at the other side. But the child
had guessed aright. The kind-hearted
Laurent began soon to feel
his own confinement, almost as solitary
as the prince’s, more than he
could bear. He petitioned to have
some one to assist him in his duties,
and, owing to some secret influence
of the royalists, a man named Gomin,
who was at heart devoted to
their cause, was appointed. The
only benefit which the young prisoner
derived from the change of his
jailers was that civility and cleanliness
had replaced insolence and
dirt. For the rest, he was still locked
up alone, never seeing any one
except at meal times, when the two
guardians and a municipal were present,
the former being often powerless
to control the insulting remarks
and gratuitous cruelty of the latter.
So the wretched days dragged
on, silent, monotonous, miserable.
Meanwhile, Paris was breathing freely
after the long night of Terror.
The Fraternity of the Guillotine was
well-nigh over, and the <i lang="fr">Jeunesse
dorée</i> had flung away the red caps
and the <i lang="fr">Carmagnole</i>, and was disporting
itself with a light heart in
gaudy attire of the antique cut.
Fair <i lang="fr">citoyennes</i> discarded the unbecoming
and therefore, even to the
most patriotic among them, odious
costume of the republic, and decked
themselves out in flowing Greek
draperies, binding their hair with
gold and silver fillets like Clytemnestra
and Antigone, and replacing
the <i lang="fr">sabots</i> of the people with
picturesque sandals, clothing their
naked feet only in ribbons, despite
the biting cold of this memorable
winter. The death-beacons one by
one had been quenched, not by nimble
hands, like the lights of the ballroom
or the gay flame of the street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
but in blood dashed freely over
their lurid glare. Terrified men
were emerging from their holes and
hiding-places; nobles were returning
from exile; there was a sudden
flaming up of merriment, an effervescence
of luxury, an intoxicating
thirst for pleasure, a hunger to eat
of the good things of life, of which
the reign of <i lang="fr">sans-culottism</i> had
starved them. There were gay gatherings
in all ranks; in the highest
the <i lang="fr">bals des victimes</i>, where the guests
wore a badge of crape on their arm,
as a sign that they had lost a near
relative on the guillotine&mdash;none
others being admitted. So, while
the waltzers spun round to the clang
of brass music and in the blaze of
wax-lights, and all the world was
embracing and exchanging congratulations,
like men escaped from impending
death, the tragedy in the
Tower drew to its end unheard and
unheeded. The King of La Vendée
ate his dinner of “<i lang="fr">bouilli</i> and
dry vegetables, generally beans”;
the same at eight o’clock for supper,
when he was locked up for the
night, and left unmolested till nine
next morning. One day there came
a rough, blustering man to the prison,
who flung open the doors with
much noise, and talked like thunder.
His name was Delboy. He
chanced to arrive at the dinner-time.
“Why this wretched food?”
cried the noisy visitor. “If <em>they</em> were
still at the Tuileries, I would help to
starve them out; but here they are
our prisoners, and it is unworthy of
the nation to starve them. Why these
blinds? Under the reign of equality
the sun should shine for all.
Why is he separated from his sister?
Under the reign of fraternity why
should they not see each other?”
Then addressing the child in a gentler
tone, he said, “Should you not
like, my boy, to play with your sister?
If you forget your origin, I don’t
see why the nation should remember
it.” He reminded the guardians
that it was not the little Capet’s
fault that he was his father’s
son&mdash;it was his misfortune; he was
now only “an unfortunate child,”
and the “nation should be his mother.”
The only advantage the
unfortunate child derived from this
strange visit was that the lamp of
his dungeon was lighted henceforth
at dark. Gomin asked this favor
on the spot, and it was granted.
The commissioners were continually
changed&mdash;a circumstance which
proved a frequent cause of suffering
and annoyance to the captive, who
was the victim of their respective
tempers, often fierce and cruel as
those of his jailers of the earlier
days. These accumulated miseries
were finally wearing out his little
remnant of strength. The malady
which for some time past gave serious
alarm to his two kind-hearted
friends, Laurent and Gomin, increased
with sudden rapidity, and
in the month of February, 1795,
assumed a threatening character.
He could hardly move from extreme
weakness, and had lost all
desire to do so. When he went for
his airing, Laurent or Gomin had
to carry him in their arms. He let
them do so reluctantly; but he was
now too apathetic to resist anything.
The surgeon of the prison was called
in, and certified that “the little
Capet had tumors on all his joints,
especially his knees; that it was impossible
to extract a word from him;
that he never would rise from his
chair or his bed, and refused to
take any kind of exercise.” This
report brought a deputation of
members of the Sûreté Générale,
who were so horrified at the state
of things they found that they drew
up the following appeal to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
colleagues: “For <em>the honor of the
nation</em>, who knew nothing of these
horrors; for that of the Convention,
which was, in truth, also ignorant of
them; and even for that of the
guilty municipality of Paris itself,
who knew all and was the cause of
all these cruelties, we should make
no public report, but only state the
result in a secret meeting of the
committee.” This confession is revolting
enough; but it might find
some shadow of excuse, if, after hiding
the cruelties for the sake of
shielding the wretches who had
sanctioned them, these deputies
had taken steps to repair the wrong-doing,
and to alleviate the position
of the victim; but, as far as the
evidence goes, nothing of the sort
was done.</p>

<p>The tomb-like solitude to which
the young prince had so long been
subjected, added to the chronic
terror in which he had lived from
the time of his coming under Simon’s
tutelage, had induced him to
maintain an obstinate, unbroken silence.
He could not be persuaded
to answer a question, to utter a
word. Yet it was evident enough
that this did not proceed from stupidity
or insensibility, but that his
faculties still retained much of their
native vivacity and sensitiveness.
Gomin was so timid by nature that,
in spite of his affection for his little
charge, he seldom ventured on any
outward expression of sympathy,
afraid he should be detected and
made, like so many others, to pay
the penalty of it. One day, however,
that he chanced to be left
quite alone with him, he felt safe
to let his heart speak, and showed
great tenderness to the child; the
boy fixed a long, wistful look on his
face, and then rose and advanced
timidly to the door, his eyes still
fastened on Gomin with an expression
of entreaty too significant to
be misunderstood. “No, no,” said
Gomin, shaking his head reluctantly;
“you know <em>that</em> cannot be.”
“<em>Oh! I must see her</em>,” cried the
poor child. “<em>Oh! pray, pray let me
see her just once before I die!</em>” Gomin
made no answer but by his
look of pity and regret, and, going
up to the child, led him gently
from the door. The young prince
threw himself on the bed with a
gesture of despair, and remained
there, senseless and motionless, so
long that his guardian at one moment,
as he confessed afterwards,
feared he was dead. Poor child!
The longing to see his mother had
of late taken the shape of a hope,
and he had been busy in his mind
as to how it could possibly be realized;
this had been an opportunity,
he thought, and the disappointment
overwhelmed him. Gomin said
that, for his part, the sight of the
boy’s grief nearly broke his heart.
The incident, he believed, hastened
the crisis, that was now steadily advancing.
A few days after this occurrence
a new commissary came
to inspect the prisoner, and, after
eyeing him curiously, as if he had
been a strange variety of animal, he
said out loud to Laurent and Gomin,
who were standing by, “That
child has not six weeks to live!”
Fearing the shock these words
might cause the subject of them,
the guardians ventured to say something
to modify their meaning; the
commissary turned on them, and
with a savage oath repeated, “I tell
you, citizens, in six weeks he will
be an idiot, if he is not dead!”
When he left the room, the young
prince gazed after him with a
mournful smile. The sentence, brutally
delivered as it was, had no
fears for him; presently a few teardrops
stole down his cheeks, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
he murmured, as if speaking to
himself, “And yet I never did any
harm to anybody.”</p>

<p>A new affliction now awaited
him. The kind and faithful Laurent
left him. His post in the Tower,
repulsive from the first, had become
utterly insupportable to him
of late, and on the death of his
mother he applied to be liberated
from it. When he came to bid farewell
to the unhappy child, whose lot
he had endeavored to soften as far
as his power admitted, the prince
squeezed his hand affectionately,
<em>looked</em> his regret at him, but uttered
no word.</p>

<p>Laurent was replaced by a man
named Lasne, formerly a soldier
in the old Gardes Françaises,
now a house-painter. For the
first few weeks after his arrival the
young prince was mute to him, as
he had been to his predecessor, until
the latter’s persevering kindness
had disarmed timidity and mistrust.
A trifle at last broke the ice.
Lasne was in the habit of talking
to his little charge, making kindly
remarks, or telling stories that he
thought might amuse him, never
waiting for any sign of response.
One day he happened to tell him
of something that occurred when
he, Lasne, had been in the old
guard, and, being on guard at the
Tuileries, had seen the Dauphin
reviewing a regiment of children
which had been formed for his
amusement, and of which he was
colonel. The boy’s countenance
beamed with a sudden ray of surprise
and pleasure, and he exclaimed
in a whisper, as if afraid of being
overheard, “And didst thou see me
with my sword?” Lasne answered
that he had, and from this forth
they were fast friends. Bolder,
though scarcely more sympathizing,
than either Laurent or Gomin,
Lasne determined to apply
at headquarters for some decisive
change in the prince’s treatment.
He induced his colleague to join
him in signing a report to the effect
that “the little Capet was indisposed.”
This was inscribed on
the Temple register; but no notice
was taken, and in a few days they
both again protested in stronger
terms: “The little Capet is seriously
indisposed.” No notice being
taken of this, the brave men
wrote a third time: “The life of
little Capet is in danger!” This
finally brought a response. M. Desault,
one of the first physicians in
Paris, was sent to visit the young
prince. He had come too late,
however; the malady which had
carried off the elder Dauphin had
taken too deep a hold on the child’s
life to be now arrested or overcome.
Nothing could induce the prince to
answer a question or speak a word to
the doctor or in his presence; and
it was only after great difficulty, and
at the earnest entreaties of his two
guardians, that he consented to
swallow the medicines prescribed.
By degrees, however, as it always
happened, the persistent kindness
and sympathizing looks and words
of M. Desault conquered his suspicions
or timidity; and though he
never plucked up courage to speak
to him, the municipals being always
present, he would take hold of the
doctor’s coat, and thus express a
desire for him to prolong his visit.
This lasted three weeks.</p>

<p>Among the commissaries there
was a M. Bellenger, an artist, who
was deeply touched by the pitiable
condition of the child, and one day,
thinking to give him a moment’s diversion,
he brought a portfolio of
drawings, and showed them to him
while waiting in his room for M.
Desault to come. The novel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
amusement seemed to interest him
very little. He looked on listlessly,
as M. Bellenger turned over the
sketches for his inspection; then, as
the doctor did not appear, the artist
said, “Sir, there is another
sketch that I should have much
pleasure in carrying away with me,
if it were not disagreeable to you.”
The deferential manner, coupled
with the title “monsieur,” so long
a foreign sound to the captive’s ear,
startled and moved him. “What
sketch?” he said, for the first time
breaking silence. “Your features,
if it were not disagreeable to you,
it would give me great pleasure.”
“Would it?” said the child and he
smilingly acquiesced. M. Bellenger
completed his sketch, and still
no doctor appeared; he took leave
of the prince, saying he would come
at the same hour the following day.
He did so; but M. Desault was
again unpunctual. The time for his
visit elapsed, and he neither came
nor sent a message. The commissary
suggested that some one
should be despatched to inquire
the reason of his absence; but even
so simple a step as this Lasne and
Gomin dared not venture on without
direct orders. They were discussing
what had best be done,
when a new commissary arrived
and satisfied all inquiries: “There
is no need to send after M. Desault;
he died yesterday.” This sudden
death was the signal for the wildest
conjectures. It was rumored that
the physician had been bribed to
poison the prince, and then in remorse
had poisoned himself. In
times like those such a report was
eagerly accepted, fed as it was by the
mystery which surrounded the inmate
of the Tower, and the vague
stories afloat concerning the character
of the ill-omened dungeon and
the people who now ruled there.</p>

<p>But there was no foundation for
the story in actual facts. M. Desault
was a man of unimpeachable
integrity, whose entire life gave the
lie to so odious a suspicion. “The
only poison which shortened my
brother’s life,” says Mme. Royale,
“was filth, made more fatal by
cruelty.” The death of the kind
and clever physician, from whatever
cause it arose, was a serious loss
to the forsaken sufferer in the Temple.
He remained for several days
without medical care of any sort,
until, on the 5th of June, M. Pelletan,
surgeon of one of the large hospitals,
was named to attend him. It
would seem as if the race of tigers
was dying out, except in the ranks
of the patriot municipals; for all who
by accident approached the poor
child in these last days were filled
at once with melting pity, and
found courage to give utterance to
this feeling aloud. M. Pelletan
remonstrated with the utmost indignation
on the darkness and
closeness of the room where his
patient was lodged, and on the
amount of bolting and barring that
went on every time the door was
opened or shut, the violent crash
being injuriously agitating to the
child. The guardians were willing
enough to do away with the whole
thing, but the municipals observed
that there was no authority for removing
the bars or otherwise altering
the arrangements complained
of. “If you can’t open the window
and remove these irons, you cannot
at least object to remove him to
another room,” said the doctor,
speaking in a loud and vehement
tone, as he surveyed the horrible
precincts. The prince started, and,
beckoning to this bold, unknown
friend, forgot his self-imposed
dumbness, and whispered, drawing
M. Pelletan down to him: “Hush!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
If you speak so loud, <em>they</em> will hear
you; and I don’t want them to know
I am so ill; they would be frightened.”
He was alluding to the queen
and Mme. Elizabeth, whom he believed
still living in the story
above. Every one present was
moved by the tender thoughtfulness
the words betrayed, and the
commissary, carried away by sympathy
for the unconscious little
orphan, exclaimed: “I take it upon
myself to authorize the removal, in
compliance with Citizen Pelletan’s
instruction.” Gomin, nothing
loath, immediately lifted the patient
in his arms, and carried him off to a
bright room in the little tower,
which had been formerly the drawing-room
of the keeper of the archives,
and was now hurriedly prepared
for the accommodation of
this new inmate. His eyes had been
so long accustomed to the gloom
that they were painfully dazzled by
the sudden change into the full sunshine.
He hid his face on Gomin’s
shoulder for a while, but by degrees
he became able to bear the light,
and drew long breaths, opening out
his little hands as if to embrace the
blessed sunshine, and then turned
a look of ineffable happiness and
thanks on Gomin, who still held
him in his arms at the open window.
When eight o’clock came, he was
once more locked up alone.</p>

<p>Next day M. Pelletan came early
to see him; he found him lying
on his bed, and basking placidly
in the sunny freshness of the
June air that was streaming in upon
him. “Do you like your new
room?” inquired the doctor. The
child drew a long breath. “Oh!
yes,” he said, with a smile that
went to every heart. But even at
this happy crisis the sting of the
old serpent woke up, as if to remind
the victim that it was not dead.
At dinner-time a new commissary,
a brute of the name of Hébert, and
full worthy of that abominable
name, burst into the room, and began
to talk in the coarse, boisterous
tones once so familiar to the
captive. “How now! Who gave
permission for this? Since when
have <i lang="fr">carabins</i> governed the republic?
This must be altered! You
must have the orders of the Commune
for moving the wolf-cub.”
The child dropped a cherry that he
was putting to his lips, fell back on
his pillow, and neither spoke nor
moved till evening, when he was
locked up for the night, and left to
brood alone over the terrible prospect
which Hébert’s threats had
conjured up.</p>

<p>M. Pelletan found him so much
worse next day that he wrote to
the Sûreté Générale for another
medical opinion; and M. Dumangier
was ordered to attend. Before
they arrived the prince had a fainting
fit, which lasted so long that it
terrified his guardians. He had,
however, quite recovered from it
when the physicians came. They
held a consultation; but it was a
mere form. Death was written on
every lineament of the wasted body.
All that science could do was to alleviate
the last days of the fast-flitting
life. The two medical men
expressed surprise and anger at the
solitude to which the dying child
was still subjected at night, and insisted
on a nurse being immediately
provided. It was not worth the
“nation’s” while to refuse anything
now. The order for procuring
the nurse was at once given; but
that night the old rule prevailed,
and the patient was again locked
up alone. He felt it acutely; the
merciful change that had been effected
in so many ways had revived
his hopes&mdash;the one hope to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
his young heart had been clinging in
silence, fondly and perseveringly.</p>

<p>When Gomin said good-night to
him, he murmured, while the big
tears ran down his face, “Still
alone, and my mother in the other
tower!” He was not to be kept
apart from her much longer. When
Lasne came next morning, he
thought him rather better. The
doctors, however, were of a different
opinion; they found him sinking
rapidly, and despatched a bulletin
to the Commune to this effect.</p>

<p>At 11 in the forenoon Gomin
came to relieve Lasne by the bedside
of the captive. They remained
a long time silent; there was
something solemn in the stillness
which Gomin did not like to break,
and the child never was the first
to speak. At last Gomin, bending
tenderly towards him, expressed his
sorrow at seeing him so weak and
exhausted. “Oh! be comforted,”
replied the prince in a whisper; “I
shall not suffer long now.” Gomin
could not control his emotion, but
dropt on his knees by the bedside,
and wept silently; the child took
his hand and pressed it to his lips,
while Gomin prayed. This was
the only ministry the son of S.
Louis was to have on his deathbed&mdash;the
tears of a turnkey, the
prayers of a poor, ignorant son of
toil; but angels were there to supplement
the unconsecrated priesthood
of charity, weeping in gentle
pity for the sufferings that were
soon to cease. Bright spirits were
hovering round the prisoner’s couch,
tuning their harps for his ears
alone.</p>

<p>Gomin raising his head from its
bowed attitude, beheld the prince
so still and motionless that he was
alarmed lest another fainting fit
had come on. “Are you in pain?”
he asked timidly. “Oh! yes, still
in pain, but less; the music is so
beautiful!” Gomin thought he
must be dreaming. There was no
music anywhere; not a sound was
audible in the room. “Where do you
hear the music?” he asked. “Up
there,” with a glance at the ceiling.
“Since when?” “Since you went
on your knees. Don’t you hear it?
Listen!” And he lifted his hand,
and his large eyes opened wide, as
if he were in an ecstasy. Gomin
remained silent, in a kind of awe.
Suddenly the child started up with
a convulsive cry of joy, and exclaimed,
“I hear my mother’s
voice amongst them!” He was
looking towards the window, his
lips parted, his whole face alight
with a wild joy and curiosity. Gomin
called to him, twice, three
times, asking him to say what he
saw. He did not hear him; he made
no answer, but fell back slowly on
his pillow, and remained motionless.
He did not speak again until
Lasne came to relieve Gomin.
Then, after a long interval of silence,
he made a sign as if he wanted
something. Lasne asked him what
it was.</p>

<p>“Do you think my sister could
hear the music?” he said. “How
she would like it!” He turned his
head with a start towards the window
again, his eyes opening with
the same expression of joyous surprise,
and uttered a half-inarticulate
exclamation; then looking at
Lasne, he whispered: “Listen! I
have something to tell you!” Lasne
took his hand, and bent down to
hear. But no words came&mdash;would
never more come from the child’s
still parted lips. He was dead.</p>

<p>So ended the tragedy of the
Temple. There is nothing more to
tell. Why should we follow the
ghastly story of the stolen heart,
deposited in the “vase with seventeen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
stars,” then surreptitiously abstracted
by the physician’s pupil,
until all faith in the authenticity of
the alleged relic evaporates?</p>

<p>Neither is it profitable to discuss
the controversy which arose over
the resting-place of the martyred
child; for even in his grave he was
pursued by malignant disputations.
Enough for us to hear and to believe
that the son of the kings of France
was accompanied to the grave by
a few humane municipals and by
his faithful friend Lasne; and that
his dust still reposes in an obscure
spot of the Cemetery of S. Margaret,
in the Faubourg St. Antoine, undisturbed
and undistinguished under
its grassy mound beneath the shadow
of the church close by.</p>

<hr class="section" />

<h3>SUBSTANTIAL GENERATIONS.<br />
II.</h3>

<p>It is customary with most of the
peripatetic writers to assume that
the Aristotelic hypothesis of substantial
generations, as understood
by S. Thomas and by his school,
cannot be rejected without upsetting
the whole scholastic philosophy.
Nothing is more false. Suarez, than
whom no modern writer has labored
more successfully in defending
and developing the scholastic philosophy,
rejects the fundamental
principle of the Aristotelic theory,
and maintains that no generation
of new compound substances is possible,
unless the matter which is
destined to receive a new form possess
an entity of its own, and be intrinsically
constituted of act and
potency, contrary to the universal
opinion of the peripatetic school.
“The first matter,” says he, “has
of itself, and not through its form,
<em>its actual entity of essence</em>, though it
has it not without an intrinsic leaning
towards the form.”<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> And
again: “The first matter has also of
itself and by itself <em>its actual entity of
existence</em> distinct from the existence
of the form, though it has it not
independently of the form.”<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> That
these two propositions clash with
the Aristotelic and Thomistic doctrine
we need not prove, as we have
already shown that neither S. Thomas
nor Aristotle admitted in their
first matter anything but the mere
potency of being; and although
Aristotle sometimes calls the first
matter “a substance” and “a subject,”
he expressly warns us that
such a substance is in potency, and
such a subject is destitute of all intrinsic
act.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Hence it is plain that
the first matter of Suarez is not the
first matter of the peripatetics;
whence it follows that the form
which is received in such a matter
is not a strictly substantial form,
since it cannot give the first being
to a matter having a <em>first</em> initial being
of its own. Hence the Suarezian
theory, though full of peripatetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
spirit, and formulated in the
common language of the peripatetic
school, is radically opposed to the
rigid peripatetic doctrine, and destroys
its foundation. “If the first
matter,” says S. Thomas, “had any
form of its own, it would be something
in act; and consequently
such a matter would not, at the supervening
of any other form, acquire
its first being, but it would only become
such or such a being; and
thus there would be no true substantial
generation, but mere alteration.
Hence all those who assumed
that the first subject of generation
is some kind of body, as air or
water, taught that generation is
nothing but alteration.”<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> This remark
of the holy doctor may be
well applied to the Suarezian theory;
for in such a theory the first matter
is “something in act” and has “a
form of its own.” And, therefore,
whoever adopts the Suarezian theory
must give up all idea of truly
substantial generations. Yet no
one who has a grain of judgment
will pretend that Suarez, by framing
his new theory, upset the scholastic
philosophy.</p>

<p>The truth is that, as there are
two definitions of the substantial
form (<i lang="la">quæ dat primum esse materiæ:
quæ dat primum esse rei</i>), so also
there are two manners of understanding
the so-called “substantial”
generation; and, whilst Aristotle
and his followers <em>assumed</em> without
any good proof<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> that the specific
form of a generated compound gives
the first being to the matter of the
compound, and is, therefore, a strictly
substantial form, the modern
school <em>demonstrates</em> from the principles
of the scholastic philosophy,
no less than from positive science,
that the specific form of a physical
compound does not give the first being
to the matter of the compound,
but only to the compound nature itself;
and, therefore, is to be called
an <em>essential</em> rather than a truly and
strictly substantial form.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The primitive material substance,
which is constituted of matter and
substantial form, cannot but be
physically simple&mdash;that is, free from
all composition of parts&mdash;though it
is metaphysically compounded, or
(as we would prefer to say) <em>constituted</em>
of act and potency. This
being the case, it evidently follows
that all substance physically compounded
must involve in its essential
constitution something else besides
the matter and the substantial
form; for it must contain in itself
both that which gives the first being
to the physical components, and
that which gives the first being to
the resulting physical compound.</p>

<p>Hence in all substance which is
physically compounded of material
parts there are always two kinds
of formal constituents. The first
kind belongs to the components,
the second to the compound. The
first consists of the substantial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
forms by which the components are
constituted in their substantial being;
which forms must actually remain
in the compound; for the
substantial being of the components
is the material cause of the physical
compound, and is the sole reason
why the physical compound receives
the name of substance. The
second is the principle by which the
first components, or elements, are
formed into a compound specific
nature. In other terms, the specific
compound is “a substance,” because
it is made up of substances,
or primitive elements, constituted
of matter and <em>substantial</em> form;
whilst the same specific compound
is “a compound” and is “of such
a specific nature,” owing to the
composition, and to such a composition,
of the primitive elements.
This composition is the <em>essential</em>
form of the material compound.</p>

<p>We may here remark that the
substantial forms of the component
elements, taken together, constitute
what may be called the <em>remote</em> formal
principle of the compound essence
(<i lang="la">principium formale quod, seu
remotum</i>), whilst the specific composition
constitutes the <em>proximate</em>
formal principle of the same compound
essence (<i lang="la">principium formale
quo, seu proximum</i>). For, as each
primitive element is immediately
constituted by its substantial form,
so is the physically compound essence
immediately constituted by
its specific composition.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to add that
the matter which is the subject of
the specific composition is not the
first matter of Aristotle, but a number
of primitive substances, and
that these substances are endowed
with real activity no less than with
real passivity, and therefore contain
in themselves such powers as are
calculated to bind together the
parts of the compound system, in
this or in that manner, according
to the geometric disposition and
the respective distances of the
same. For, as the power of matter
is limited to <em>local</em> action, it is the
<em>local</em> disposition and co-ordination
of the primitive elements that determines
the mode of exertion of
the elementary powers, inasmuch
as it determines the special conditions
under which the Newtonian
law has to be carried into execution.
On such a determination the
specific composition and the specific
properties of the compound nature
proximately depend.</p>

<p>The composition of matter with
matter is confessedly an accidental
entity, and arises from accidental
action. It would, however, be a
manifest error to pretend that such
a composition is an <em>accidental form</em>
of the compound nature. For nothing
is accidental to a subject but
what supervenes to it; whereas the
composition does not supervene to
the compound, but enters into its
very constitution. On the other
hand, the composition does not deserve
the name of <em>substantial form</em>
in the strict sense of the word,
since it does not give the first being
to the matter it compounds.
We might, indeed, call it a substantial
form in a wider sense; for in
the same manner as a compound
of many substances is called “a
substance,” so can the form of the
substantial compound be called
“substantial.” But to avoid the
danger of equivocation, we shall
not use this epithet; and we prefer
to say that the specific composition
is the <em>natural</em> or the <em>essential</em>
form of the material compound, so
far at least as there is question
of compounds <em>purely</em> material.
This essential or natural form may
be properly defined as <em>the act by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
which a number of physical parts or
terms are formed into one compound
essence</em>, or, more concisely, <em>the act
which gives the first being to the specific
compound</em>; which latter definition
is admitted by the schoolmen,
though, as interpreted by them, it
leads to no satisfactory results, as
we shall see presently.</p>

<p>The first physical compound
which possesses a permanent specific
constitution is called “a molecule.”
Those physicists who assume
matter to be intrinsically extended
and continuous, by the
name of molecule understand a little
mass filling the space occupied
by its volume, hard, indivisible, and
unchangeable, to which they also
give the name of “atom.” But this
opinion, which is a relic of the ancient
physical theories, is fast losing
ground among the men of science,
owing to the fact that molecules
are subject to internal movements,
and therefore composed of
discrete parts. Such discrete parts
must be simple and unextended elements,
as we have demonstrated.
Hence a molecule is nothing but <em>a
number of simple elements</em> (some attractive
and some repulsive) <em>permanently
connected by mutual action in
one dynamical system</em>. We say <em>permanently
connected</em>; because no
system of elements which lacks
stability can constitute permanent
substances, such as we meet everywhere
in nature. Yet the stability
of the molecular system is not an absolute,
but only a relative, unchangeableness;
for, although the bond
which unites the parts of the molecular
system must (at least in the
case of primitive molecules) remain
always the same <em>in kind</em>, it can
(even in the case of primitive molecules)
become different <em>in degree</em>
within the limits of its own kind.
And thus any molecule can be altered
by heat, by cold, by pressure, etc.,
without its specific constitution being
impaired. A molecule of hydrogen
is specifically the same at
two different temperatures, because
the change of temperature merely
modifies the bond of the constituent
elements, without destroying it or
making it specifically different; and
the same is true of all other natural
substances.</p>

<p>The <em>material</em> constituent of a
molecular system is, as we have
said, a number of primitive elements.
These elements may be
more or less numerous, and possess
greater or less power, either attractive
or repulsive; on condition,
however, that attraction shall prevail
in the system; for without the prevalence
of attraction no permanent
composition is possible.</p>

<p>The <em>formal</em> constituent of a molecular
system, or that which causes
the said primitive elements to be a
molecule, is the determination by
which the elements are bound with
one another in a definite manner,
and subjected to a definite law of
motion with respect to one another.
Such a determination is in each
of the component elements the resultant
of the actions of all the
others.</p>

<p>The matter of the molecular system
is <em>disposed</em> to receive such a determination,
or natural form, by the
relative disposition of the elements
involved in the system. Such a disposition
is local; for the resultant
of the actions by which the elements
are bound with one another
depends on their relative distances
as a condition.</p>

<p>The <em>efficient cause</em> of the molecular
system are the elements themselves;
for it is by the exertion of
their respective powers that they
unite in one permanent system
when placed under suitable mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
conditions. The original
conditions under which the molecules
of the primitive compound
substances were formed must be
traced to the sole will of the Creator,
who from the beginning disposed
all things in accordance with the
ends to be obtained through them
in the course of all centuries.</p>

<p>Molecules may differ from one
another, both as to their matter and
as to their form. They differ in
matter when they consist of a different
number of primitive elements,
or of elements possessing
different degrees of active power
or of a different proportion of attractive
and repulsive elements.
They differ as to their form, when
their constitution subjects them to
different mechanical laws; for as
the law of movement and of mutual
action which prevails within a
molecule is a formal result of its
molecular constitution, we can always
ascertain the difference of the
constitution by the difference of the
law.</p>

<p>It is well known that the law according
to which a system of material
points acts and moves can be
expressed or represented by a certain
number of mathematical formulas.
The equations by which the
mutual dynamical relations of the
elements in a molecular system
should be represented are of three
classes. Some should represent the
<em>mutual actions</em> to which such elements
are subjected at any given
moment of time; and these equations
would contain differentials of
the second order. Other equations
should represent the <em>velocities</em> with
which such elements move at any
instant of time; and these equations
would contain differentials of the
first order. Other equations, in
fine, should determine the <em>place</em> occupied
by each of such elements at
any given moment, and consequently
the figure of the molecular system;
and these last equations would
be free from differential terms. The
equations exhibiting the mutual actions
must be obtained from the
consideration of positive data, like
all other equations expressing the
conditions of a given problem. The
equations exhibiting the velocities
of the vibrating elements can be
obtained by the integration of the
preceding ones. The equations
determining the relative position
of the elements at any moment of
time will arise from the integration
of those which express the velocities
of the vibrating points. Had
we sufficient data concerning the
internal actions of a molecule, and
sufficient mathematical skill to carry
out all the operations required,
we would be able to determine with
mathematical accuracy the whole
constitution of such a molecule, and
all the properties flowing from such
a constitution. This, unfortunately,
we cannot do as yet with regard
to the molecule of any natural substance
in particular; and, therefore,
we must content ourselves with the
general principle that those molecular
systems are of the same kind
whose constitution can be exhibited
<em>by mathematical formulas of the same
form</em>, and those molecules are of a
different kind whose constitution
is represented <em>by mathematical formulas
of a different form</em>. This principle
is self-evident; for the formulas
by which the mechanical relations
of the elements are determined
cannot be of the same form, unless
the conditions which they express
are of the same nature; whereas
it is no less evident that two
molecular systems cannot be of the
same kind when their mechanical
constitution implies conditions of a
different nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Two molecules of the same kind
may differ <em>accidentally</em>&mdash;that is, as to
their mode of being&mdash;without any
essential change in their specific
constitution. Thus, two molecules
of hydrogen may be under different
pressure, or at a different temperature,
without any specific change.
In this case, the mechanical relations
between the elements of the
molecule undergo an accidental
change, and the equations by which
such relations are expressed are
also accidentally modified, inasmuch
as some of the quantities involved
in them acquire a different value;
but the form of the equations, which
is the exponent of the specific nature
of the substance, remains unchanged.</p>

<p>From these remarks four conclusions
can be drawn. The first is
that molecules consisting of a different
number of constituent elements
always differ in kind. For
it is impossible for such molecules
to be represented by equations of
the same form.</p>

<p>The second is that a molecule is
<em>one</em> owing to the oneness of the
common tie between its constituent
elements, and to their common and
stable dependence on one mechanical
law. Hence a molecule is not
<em>one substance</em>, but <em>one compound nature</em>
involving a number of substances
conspiring to form a permanent
principle of actions and passions
of a certain kind. In other terms,
a molecule is not <i lang="la">unum substantiale</i>,
but <i lang="la">unum essentiale</i> or <i lang="la">unum naturale</i>.</p>

<p>The third is that the specific
form of a molecule admits of different
degrees within the limits of its
species. This conclusion was quite
unknown to the followers of Aristotle;
and S. Thomas reprehends
Averroës for having said that the
forms of the elements (fire, water,
air, and earth) could pass through
different degrees of perfection,
whilst Aristotle teaches that they
are <i lang="la">in indivisibili</i>, and that every
change in the form changes the
specific essence.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Yet it is evident
that as there can be circles, ellipses,
and other curves having a different
degree of curvature, while preserving
the same specific form, so also
can molecules admit of a different
degree of closeness in their constitution
without trespassing on the
limits of their species. So long as
the changes made in a molecule do
not interfere with the conditions on
which the form of its equations depends,
so long the specific constitution
of the molecule remains unimpaired.
Mathematical formulas are
only artificial abridgments of metaphysical
expressions; and their accidental
changes express but the
accidental changes of the thing
which they represent. On the other
hand, it is well known that the
equations by which the specific
constitution of a compound system
is determined can preserve the
same form, while some of the quantities
they contain receive an increase
or a decrease connected
with a change of merely accidental
conditions.</p>

<p>The fourth conclusion is that a
number of primitive molecules of
different kinds may combine together
in such a manner as to impair
more or less their own individuality
by fixing themselves in a new
molecular system of greater complexity.
Likewise, a molecular system
of greater complexity is susceptible
of resolution into less complex
systems. These combinations and
resolutions are the proper object
of chemistry, which is <em>the science of
the laws, principles, and conditions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the specific changes of natural substances</em>,
and to which metaphysicians
must humbly refer when
treating of substantial generation,
if they wish to reason on the solid
ground of facts.</p>

<p>We have thus briefly stated what
we hold to be the true scientific
and philosophic view of the constitution
of natural substances; and
as we have carefully avoided all
gratuitous assumptions, we feel
confident that our readers need no
further arguments to be convinced
of its value as compared with the
hypothetical views of the old physicists.
As, however, the conclusions
of the peripatetic school concerning
the constitution and generation of
natural substances have still some
ardent supporters, who think that
the strictly substantial generations
and corruptions are demonstrated
by unanswerable arguments, we
have yet to show that such pretended
arguments consist of mere assumption
and equivocation.</p>

<p>The first argument in favor of
the old theory may be presented
under the following form: “Every
natural substance is <i lang="la">unum per se</i>&mdash;that
is, substantially one. Therefore
no natural substance implies
more than <em>one</em> substantial form.”
The antecedent is assumed as evident,
and the consequent is proved
by the principle that “from two
beings in act it is impossible to
obtain a being substantially one.”
Hence it is concluded that all natural
substances, as water, flesh, iron,
etc., have a substantial form which
gives to the first matter the being
of water, of flesh, of iron, etc.</p>

<p>This argument, instead of proving
the truth of the theory, proves
its weakness; for it consists of a
<i lang="la">petitio principii</i>. What right has
the peripatetic school to assume
that every natural substance is <i lang="la">unum
per se</i> substantially? A substance
physically simple is, of course, <i lang="la">unum
per se</i> substantially; but water,
flesh, iron, and the other natural
substances are not physically simple,
since they imply quantity of
mass and quantity of volume,
which presuppose a number of material
terms actually distinct, and
therefore possessing their distinct
substantial forms. No compound
substance can be <i lang="la">unum per se</i> as a
substance; it can be <i lang="la">unum per se</i>
only as a compound essence; and
for this reason every natural substance
contains as many <em>substantial</em>
forms as it contains primitive elements,
whereas it has only one <em>essential</em>
form, which gives the first
being to its compound nature.
This <em>one</em> essential form is, as we
have explained, the specific composition
of its constituent elements.</p>

<p>The principle “From two beings
in act it is impossible to obtain a
being <em>substantially</em> one” is perfectly
true; but it will be false if, instead
of “substantially,” we put “essentially”;
for all essences physically
compounded result from the union
of a certain number of actual beings,
and yet every compound essence
is <i lang="la">unum per se</i> essentially,
though not substantially. For, as
<i lang="la">unum per accidens</i> is that which has
something superadded to its essential
principles, so <i lang="la">unum per se</i> is
that which includes nothing in itself
but its essential principles; and
consequently every essence, as such,
is <i lang="la">unum per se</i>, whether it be physically
simple or not&mdash;that is, whether
it be one substance or a number
of substances conspiring into a
specific compound. Hence flesh,
water, iron, and every other natural
substance may be, and are,
<i lang="la">unum per se</i>, notwithstanding the
fact that they consist of a number
of primitive elements and contain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
as many substantial forms as components.</p>

<p>It is therefore manifest that this
first argument has no strength.
No ancient or modern philosopher
has ever proved that any natural
substance is <em>substantially</em> one. To
prove such an assertion it would be
necessary to show that the physical
compound is physically simple;
which, we trust, no one will attempt
to show. Even Liberatore, whose efforts
to revive among us the peripatetic
theory have been so remarkable,
seems to have felt the utter impossibility
of substantiating such an
arbitrary supposition by anything
like a proof, as he lays it down
without even pretending to investigate
its value. “True bodies,”
says he&mdash;“that is, bodies which are
substances, and not mere aggregates
of substances&mdash;are essentially
constituted of matter and substantial
form.”<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Indeed, if a body is
not an aggregate of substances, it
must be evident to every one that
the essence of that body is exclusively
constituted of matter and
substantial form. But where is a
body to be found which is not an
aggregate of substances&mdash;that is, of
primitive elements? The learned
author omits to examine this essential
point, clearly because there are
neither facts in science nor arguments
in philosophy by which it
can be settled favorably to the
peripatetic view. Thus the whole
theory of substantial generations,
understood in the peripatetic sense,
rests on a mere assumption contradicted,
as we know, by natural science
no less than by metaphysical
reasoning.</p>

<p>The second argument of the peripatetic
school is as follows: When
the matter has its first being, all
form supervening to it is accidental;
for the matter which has its first being
cannot receive but a being <i lang="la">secundum
quid</i>&mdash;that is, a mode of being
which is an accident. But the natural
substance cannot be constituted
by an accidental form. Therefore
the form of the natural substance
does not supervene to any
matter having its first being, but
itself gives the first being to its
matter, and therefore is a strictly
substantial form.</p>

<p>Our answer is very plain. We
admit that, when the matter has
its first being, all supervening form
is accidental <em>to it</em>; and we admit,
also, that the composition of matter
with matter is an accidental entity,
and gives to the matter an
accidental mode of being. This,
however, does not mean that the
specific composition is an <em>accidental
form</em> of the compound nature.
Composition, as compared with substance,
is an accident; but, as compared
with the essence of the compound,
is an <em>essential</em> constituent,
as we have already remarked; for
it is of the essence of all physical
compounds to have a number
of substances as their matter, and
a specific composition as their form.
In other terms, the essence of a
physical compound involves substance
and accident alike; but
what is an accident of the component
substances is not an accident
of the compound essence. Hence
the proposition, “The natural substance
cannot be constituted by an
accidental form,” must be distinguished.
If “natural substance”
stands for the primitive substances
that constitute the matter of the
compound nature, the proposition is
true; for all such substances have
their strictly substantial forms, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
is obvious. If “natural substance”
stands for the compound nature
itself, inasmuch as it is a compound
of a certain species, then the proposition
must be subdistinguished.
For, if by “accidental form” we
understand an accident of the component
substances, the proposition
will be false; for, evidently, the
compound nature is constituted by
composition, and composition is an
accident of the components. Whilst,
if the words “accidental form” are
meant to express an accident of the
compound nature, then the proposition
is true again; for the composition
is not an accidental, but an essential,
constituent of the compound,
as every one must concede.
Yet “essential” is not to be confounded
with “substantial”; and
therefore, though all natural substances
must have their essential
form, it does not follow that such a
form gives the first being to the
matter, but only that it gives the
first being to the specific compound
inasmuch as it is such a compound.
Had the peripatetics kept in view,
when treating of natural substances,
the necessary distinction between the
essential and the strictly substantial
forms, they would possibly have
concluded, with the learned Card.
Tolomei, that their theory was “a
groundless assumption,” and their
arguments a “begging the question.”
But, unfortunately, Aristotle’s authority,
before the discoveries of
modern science, had such a weight
with our forefathers that they
scarcely dared to question what
they believed to be the cardinal
point of his philosophy. But let
us go on.</p>

<p>A third argument in favor of the
old theory is drawn from the constitution
of man. In man the soul
is a substantial form, the root of all
his properties, and the constituent
of the human substance. Hence
all other natural substances, it is
argued, must have in a similar
manner some substantial principle
containing the formal reason of
their constitution, of their natural
properties, and of their operations.
“The fact that man is composed
of matter and of substantial form
shows,” says Suarez, “that in natural
things there is a substantial
subject naturally susceptible of being
informed by a substantial act.
Such a subject (the matter) is
therefore an imperfect and incomplete
substance, and requires to be
constantly under some substantial
act.”<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Whence it follows that all
natural substance consists of matter
actuated by a substantial form.</p>

<p>This argument, according to Scotus
and his celebrated school, is
based on a false assumption. Man
is not <em>one substance</em>, but <em>one nature</em>
resulting from the union of two
distinct substances, the spiritual
and the material; and to speak of
a <em>human substance</em> as one is nothing
less than to beg the whole question.
Every one must admit that the
human soul is the <em>natural</em> form of
the animated body, and that, inasmuch
as it is a substance and not
an accident, the same soul may be
called a “substantial” form; but,
according to the Scotistic school,
to which we cannot but adhere on
this point, it is impossible to admit
the Thomistic notion that the soul
gives the first being to the matter
of the body, so as to constitute <em>one
substance</em> with it; and accordingly
it is impossible to admit that the
soul is a strictly “substantial” form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
in the rigid peripatetic sense of the
word; and thus the above argument,
which is based entirely on
the unity of human <em>substance</em>, comes
to naught.</p>

<p>This is not the place to develop
the reasons adduced by the Scotists
and by others against the Thomistic
school, or to refute the arguments
by which the latter have supported
their opinion. We will merely remark
that, according to a principle
universally received, by the Thomists
no less than by their opponents
(<i lang="la">Actus est qui distinguit</i>), there
can be no distinct substantial terms
without distinct substantial acts;
and consequently our body cannot
have distinct substantial parts, unless
it has as many distinct substantial
acts. And as there is no
doubt that there are in our body a
great number of distinct substantial
parts (as many, in fact, as there are
primitive elements of matter), there
is no doubt that there are also a
great number of distinct substantial
acts. It is not true, therefore, that
the human body (or any other
body) is constituted by <em>one</em> “substantial”
form. The soul is not
defined as the <em>first act of matter</em>, but
it is defined as <em>the first act of a physical
organic body</em>; which means
that the body must possess its own
<em>physical</em> being and its <em>bodily</em> and
<em>organic</em> form before it can be informed
by a soul. And surely such
a body needs not receive from the
soul what it already possesses as a
condition of its information; it
must therefore receive that alone in
regard to which it is still potential;
and this is, not the first act of being,
but the first act of life. But if
the soul were a strictly “substantial”
form according to the Thomistic
opinion, it should be <em>the first act
of matter</em> as such, and it would
have no need of a previously-formed
physical organic body; for the
position of such a form would, of
itself, entail the existence of its substantial
term. We must therefore
conclude that the human soul is
called a “substantial” form, simply
because it is a substance and not
an accident,<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and because, in the
language of the schools, all the “essential”
forms have been called
“substantial,” as we have noticed
at the beginning of this article.
We believe that it is owing to this
double meaning of the epithet “substantial”
that both S. Thomas and
his followers were led to confound
the natural and essential with the
strictly substantial forms. They
reasoned thus: “What is not accidental
must be substantial”; and
they did not reflect that “what is
not accidental may be <em>essential</em>,”
without being substantial in the
meaning attached by them to the
term.</p>

<p>But since we cannot here discuss
the question concerning the
human soul as its importance deserves,
let us admit, for the sake of
the argument, that the human soul
gives the first being to its body, and
is thus a strictly substantial form
in the sense intended by our opponents.
It still strikes us that no
logical mind can from such a particular
premise draw such a general
conclusion as is drawn in the objected
argument. Is it lawful to
apply to inanimate bodies in the
conclusion what in the premises is
asserted only of animated beings?
Or is there any parity between the
form of the human nature and that
of a piece of chalk? The above-mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Card. Tolomei well remarks
that “such a pretended parity
is full of disparities, and that
from the human soul, rational,
spiritual, subsistent, and immortal,
we cannot infer the nature of those
incomplete, corruptible, and corporeal
entities which enter into the
constitution of purely material
things.”<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>That “all natural substances
must have some substantial principle”
we fully admit. For we have
shown that in every natural compound
there are just as many substantial
forms as there are primitive
elements in it, and therefore there
is no doubt that each point of matter
receives its first being through
a strictly substantial form. But
these substantial forms are the forms
of the components; they are not
the <em>specific form</em> of the compound.
Nor do we deny that the properties
of the compound must be ultimately
traced to some substantial principle;
for we admit the common
axiom that “the first principle of
the being is the first principle of its
operations”; and thus we attribute
the activity of the compound nature
to the substantial forms of
its components. But we maintain
that the same components may constitute
different specific compounds
having different properties and different
operations, according as they
are disposed in different manners
and subjected to a different composition.
This being evident, we
must be allowed to conclude that
the proximate and specific constituent
form of a compound inanimate
nature is nothing else than its
specific composition.</p>

<p>Our opponents cannot evade this
conclusion, which annihilates the
whole peripatetic theory, unless
they show either that there may be
a compound without composition,
or that in natural things there is no
material composition of substantial
parts. The first they cannot prove,
as a compound without composition
is a mere contradiction. Nor
can they prove the second; for they
admit that natural substances are
extended, and it is evident that
there can be no material extension
without parts outside of parts, and
therefore without material composition.</p>

<p>As to the passage of Suarez objected
in the argument, two simple
remarks will suffice. The first is
that “the fact that man is composed
of matter and substantial form
does <em>not</em> show that in other natural
things there is a substantial subject
naturally susceptible of being informed
by a substantial act”; unless,
indeed, the epithet “substantial”
be taken in the sense of
“essential,” as we have above explained.
But, even in this case,
there will always be an immense
difference between such essential
forms, because the form of a human
body must be a substance, whilst
the form of the purely material compounds
can be nothing else than
composition. The second remark
is that, as the first matter, according
to Suarez, has its own entity of
essence and its own entity of existence,
“the substantial subject naturally
susceptible of being informed”
has neither need nor capability
of receiving its <em>first</em> being; whence
it follows that such a substantial
subject is never susceptible of being
informed by a truly and strictly
substantial form. We know that
Suarez rejects this inference on the
ground that the entity of matter,
according to him, is incomplete, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
requires to be perfected by a substantial
form. But the truth is that
no strictly substantial form can be
conceived to inform a matter which
has already an actual entity of its
own; for the substantial form is
not simply that which <em>perfects the
matter</em> (for every form perfects the
matter), but it is that which <em>gives
to it the first being</em>, as all philosophers
agree. On the other hand,
it might be proved that the matter
which is a subject of natural generations
is not an <em>incomplete</em> substantial
entity, and that the intrinsic act
by which it is constituted, is not,
as Suarez pretends, an act <i lang="la">secundum
quid</i>, but an act <i lang="la">simpliciter</i>; it being
evident that nothing can be in
act <i lang="la">secundum quid</i> unless it be
already in act <i lang="la">simpliciter</i>; whence
it is manifest that the <em>first</em> act of
matter cannot be an act <i lang="la">secundum
quid</i>.</p>

<p>It would take too long to discuss
here the whole Suarezian theory.
Its fundamental points are two:
The first, that the matter which is
the subject of natural generations
“has an entity of its own”; the
second, that “such an entity is substantially
incomplete.” The first
of these two points he establishes
against the peripatetics with very
good reasons, drawn from the nature
of generation; but the second he
does not succeed in demonstrating,
as he does not, and cannot, demonstrate
that an act <i lang="la">secundum quia</i>
precedes the act <i lang="la">simpliciter</i>. For
this reason we ventured to say in
our previous article that the first
matter of Suarez corresponds to our
primitive elements, which, though
unknown to him, are, in fact, the
first physical matter of which the
natural substances are composed.
What we mean is that, though Suarez
intended to prove something
else, he has only succeeded in proving
that the matter of which natural
substances are composed is as
true and as complete a substance
as any primitive substance can be.
And we even entertain some suspicion
that this great writer would
have held a language much more
conformable to our modern views,
had he not been afraid of striking
too heavy a blow at the peripatetic
school, then so formidable and respected.
For why should he call
“substantial” the forms of compound
bodies, when he knew that
the matter of those bodies had already
an actual entity of its own?
He certainly saw that such forms
were by no means the substantial
forms of S. Thomas and of Aristotle;
but was it prudent to state the
fact openly, and to draw from it
such other conclusions as would
have proved exceedingly distasteful
to the greatest number of his contemporaries?
However this may
be, it cannot be denied that the
Suarezian theory, granting to the
matter of the bodies an entity of its
own, leads to the rejection of the
truly substantial generations, and
to the final adoption of the doctrine
which we are maintaining in accordance
with the received principles
of modern natural science. But let
us proceed.</p>

<p>The fourth argument in favor of
the old theory is the following: If
the components remain <em>actually</em> in
the compound, and do not lose their
substantial forms by the accession
of a new substantial form, it follows
that no new substance is ever generated;
and thus what we call “new
substances” will be only “new accidental
aggregates of substances,”
and there will be no substantial difference
between them. But this
cannot be admitted; for who will
admit that bread and flesh are <em>substantially</em>
identical? And yet who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
can deny that from bread flesh can
be generated?</p>

<p>We concede most explicitly that
no new “substance” is, or can be,
ever generated by natural processes.
God alone can produce a substance,
and he produces it by creation. To
say that natural causes can destroy
the substantial forms by which the
matter is actuated, and produce
new substantial forms giving a new
<em>first</em> being to the matter, is to endow
the natural causes with a power
infinitely superior to their nature.
The action of a natural cause is the
production of an accidental act;
and so long as “accidental” does
not mean “substantial,” we contend
that no substantial form can originate
from any natural agent or concurrence
of natural agents. It is
therefore evident for us that no
“substance” can ever arise by natural
generation.</p>

<p>But, though this is true, it is evident
also that from pre-existing substances
“a new compound nature”
can be generated by the action of
natural causes. These new compound
natures are, indeed, called
“new substances,” but they are the
<em>old</em> substances under a <em>new</em> specific
composition; that is, they are not
new as substances, though they
form <em>a new specific compound</em>. To
say that such a compound is “a
merely accidental aggregate of substances”
is no objection. Were
we to maintain that <em>one single substance</em>
is an accidental aggregate
of substances, the objection would
be very natural; but to say, as we
do, that <em>one compound essence</em> is an
aggregate of substances united by
accidental actions, is to say what
is evidently true and unobjectionable.
Yet we must add that the
composition of such substances, accidental
though it be to them individually,
is <em>essential</em> to the compound
nature; for this compound nature is
a special essence, endowed with
special properties dependent proximately
on the special composition,
and only remotely on the substantial
forms of the component substances.</p>

<p>That there may be “no substantial
difference” between two natural
compounds is quite admissible;
but it does not follow from the argument.
It is admissible; because
a different specific composition suffices
to cause a different specific
compound; as is the case with gum-arabic
and cane-sugar, which consist
of a different combination of
the same components. Yet it does
not follow from the argument; because
the specific composition of
different compounds may require,
and usually does require, a different
set of components&mdash;that is, of substances;
which shows that there is
also a <em>substantial</em> difference between
natural compounds, although their
essential form be not the substantial
form of the peripatetics.</p>

<p>Lastly, we willingly concede that
bread and flesh are not substantially
identical; but we must deny that
their substantial difference arises
from their having a different substantial
form. Bread and flesh are
different specific compounds; they
differ essentially and substantially,
or formally and materially, because
they involve different substances
under a different specific composition.
To say that bread and flesh
are <em>the same matter</em> under two different
substantial forms would be to
give the lie to scientific evidence.
This we cannot do, however much
we may admire the great men who,
from want of positive knowledge,
thought it the safest course to accept
from Aristotle what seemed to
them a sufficient explanation of
things. On the other hand, is it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
not strange that our opponents,
who admit of no other substantial
form in man, except the soul,
should now mention a substantial
form of flesh? To be consistent,
they should equally admit a <em>substantial</em>
form of blood, a <em>substantial</em> form
of bone, etc. Perhaps this would
help them to understand that the
epithet “substantial,” when applied
to characterize the forms of material
compounds, has been a source
of innumerable equivocations, and
that the schoolmen would have
saved themselves much trouble, and
avoided inextricable difficulties, if
they had made the necessary distinction
between <em>substantial</em> and
<em>essential</em> forms.</p>

<p>The arguments to which we have
replied are the main support of the
peripatetic doctrine; we, at least,
have not succeeded in finding any
other argument on the subject
which calls for a special refutation.
We beg, therefore, to conclude that
the theory of strictly substantial
generations, as well as that of the
constitution of bodies, as held by
the peripatetic school, rest on no
better ground than “assumption,”
or <i lang="la">petitio principii</i>, as Card. Tolomei
reluctantly avows. There would
yet remain, as he observes, the argument
from authority; but when
it is known that the great men
whose authority is appealed to were
absolutely ignorant of the most important
facts and laws of molecular
science, and when it is proved that
such facts and laws exclude the
very possibility of the old theory,<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
we are free to dismiss the argument.
“Were S. Thomas to come
back on earth,” says Father Tongiorgi,
“he would be a peripatetic no
more.” No doubt of it. S. Thomas
would teach his friends a lesson,
by letting them know that his
true followers are not those who
shut their eyes to the evidence of
facts, that they may not be disturbed
in their peripateticism, but those
who imitate him by endeavoring to
utilize, in the interest of sound
philosophy, the positive knowledge
of their own time, as he did the
scanty positive knowledge of his.</p>

<p>But we have yet an important
point to notice. The ancient theory
is wholly grounded on the possibility
of the eduction of new substantial
forms out of the potency
of matter; hence, if no truly substantial
form can be so educed, the
theory falls to the ground. We
have already shown that true substantial
forms giving the first being
to the matter cannot naturally be
educed out of the potency of matter.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
This would suffice to justify
us in rejecting the peripatetic theory.
But to satisfy our peripatetic
friends that we did not come too
hastily to such a conclusion, and to
give them an opportunity of examining
their own philosophical conscience,
we beg leave to submit to
their appreciation the following additional
reasons.</p>

<p>First, all philosophers agree that
the matter cannot be actuated by a
new form, unless it be <em>actually</em> disposed
to receive it. But actual
disposition is itself an accidental
form; and all matter that has an
accidental form has also <i lang="la">a fortiori</i>
a substantial form. Therefore no
matter is actually disposed to receive
a new form, but that which
has actually a substantial form.
But the matter which has actually
a substantial form is not susceptible
of a new substantial form; for the
matter which has its first being is
not potential with regard to it, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
only with regard to some mode of
being. Therefore no new form
truly and strictly substantial can be
bestowed upon existing matter.</p>

<p>Secondly, if existing matter is to
receive a new substantial form, its
old substantial form must give way
and disappear, as our opponents
themselves teach, by natural corruption.
But the form which gives
the first being to the matter is not
corruptible. Therefore no truly
substantial form can give way to a
new substantial form. The minor
of this syllogism is easily proved.
For all natural substances consist
of simple elements, of which every
one has its first being by a form altogether
simple and incorruptible.
Moreover, the substantial form of
primitive elements is a product of
creation, not of generation; the
term of divine, not of natural, action;
it cannot, therefore, perish,
except by annihilation. The only
form which is liable to corruption
is that which links together the elements
of the specific compound;
but this is a natural and essential,
not a strictly substantial, form.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the form which gives the
first being to the matter is altogether
incorruptible, if the same is
not subject to alteration; for alteration
is the way to corruption. But
no form giving the first being to
the matter is subject to alteration.
For, according to the universal
doctrine, it is the matter, not the
form, that is in potency to receive
the action of natural agents. The
form is an active, not a passive,
principle; and therefore it is ready
to act, not to be acted on; which
proves that substantial forms are
inalterable and incorruptible. We
are at a loss to understand how it
has been possible for so many illustrious
philosophers of the Aristotelic
school not to see the open contradiction
between the corruption
of strictly substantial forms and
their own fundamental axiom:
“Every being acts inasmuch as it is
in act, and suffers inasmuch as it is
in potency.” If the substantial
form is subject to corruption, surely
the substance suffers not only inasmuch
as it is in potency, but also,
and even more, inasmuch as it is in
act. We say “even more,” because
the substance would, inasmuch as
it is in act, suffer the destruction of
its very essence; whereas, as it is in
potency, it would not suffer more
than an accidental change. It is
therefore manifest that the corruption
of substantial forms cannot be
admitted without denying one of
the most certain and universal
principles of metaphysics.</p>

<p>Fourthly, if the natural agents
concerned in the generation of a
new being cannot produce anything
but accidental determinations, nor
destroy anything but other accidental
determinations, then, evidently,
the form which is destroyed in the
generation of a new thing is an
accidental entity, as also the new
form introduced. But the efficient
causes of natural generations cannot
produce anything but accidental
determinations, and cannot
destroy anything but other
accidental determinations. Therefore
in the generation of a new being
both the form which is destroyed
and the form which replaces it
are accidental entities. In this
syllogism the major is evident; and
the minor is certain, both physically
and metaphysically. For it is well
known that the natural agents concerned
in the generation of a new
substance have no other power than
that of producing local motion;
also, that the matter acted on has
no other passive potency than that
of receiving local motion. Hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
no action of matter upon matter
can be admitted but that which
tends to give an accidental determination
to local movement; and
if any cause be known to exert
actions not tending to impart local
movement, we must immediately
conclude that such a cause is not a
material substance. On the other
hand, all act produced belongs to
an order of reality infinitely inferior
to that of its efficient principle; so
that, as God cannot efficiently produce
another God, so also a contingent
substance cannot efficiently
produce another contingent substance;
and a substantial form cannot
efficiently produce another substantial
form; but as all that God
efficiently produces is infinitely inferior
to him in the order of reality,
so all act produced by a created
substance is infinitely inferior to the
act which is the principle of its production.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
It is therefore impossible
to admit that the act produced,
and the act which is the principle
of its production, belong to the
same order of reality; in other
terms, they cannot be both “substantial”;
but while the act by which
the agent acts is substantial, the
act produced is always accidental.
And thus it is plain that no natural
agent or combination of natural
agents can ever produce a truly
substantial form.</p>

<p>A great deal more might be said
on this subject; but we think that
our philosophical readers need no
further reasonings of ours to be
fully convinced of the inadmissibility
of the Aristotelic hypothesis
concerning the constitution and
the generation of natural substances.
Would that the great men who
adopted it in past ages had had a
knowledge of the workings of nature
as extensive as we now possess;
their love of truth would have
prompted them to frame a philosophical
theory as superior to that of
the Greek philosopher as fact is to
assumption. As it is, we must
strive to do within the compass of
our means what they would have
done much better, and would do if
they were among the living, with
their gigantic powers. We cannot
hold in metaphysics what we have
to reject in physics. To say that
what is true in physics may be false
in metaphysics is no less an absurdity
than Luther’s proposition, that
“something may be true in philosophy
which is false in theology.”</p>

<h3>THE MODERN LITERATURE OF RUSSIA.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></h3>

<p>The history of Russia, during
the course of the last twenty years,
has entered upon a new era. It
also has had its 19th of February,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
its day of emancipation; and from
the hour when it was permitted to
treat of the times anterior to the
reign of the Emperor Nicholas, although
still maintaining a certain
reserve, it has lost no time in profiting
by the benefit of which advantage
has been eagerly taken. A
multitude of writings, more or less
important, which have since then
been published, prove that, in order
to become fruitful, it only needed to
be freed from the ligatures of the
ancient censure; and it is wonderful
to note the large number of
publications with which the history
of the last century finds itself enriched
in so short a space of time,
besides the documents of every
description that were never previously
allowed to see the light of
day, but from which the interdict
has been removed that for so
long had condemned them to the
dust and oblivion of locked-up archives.</p>

<p>Nor has this been all. The
riches of this new mine were sufficiently
plentiful to supply matter
for entire collections. Societies
were formed for the purpose of
arranging and publishing them
without delay, in order to satisfy
the legitimate desire of so many to
know the past of their country, not
only from official digests, but from
the original sources of information.
It will suffice to name the principal
collections created under the inspiration
of this idea, such as the
<cite>Russian Archives</cite>, and also the
<cite>XVIIIth and XIXth Centuries</cite>, of
M. Bartenev, guardian of the Library
of Tcherkov; the <cite>Old Russian
Times</cite> (<cite>Russkaïa Starina</cite>), of
M. Semevski; the <cite>Historical Society
of the Annalist Nestor</cite>, formed at
Kiev, under the presidency of M.
Antonovitch; the <cite>Collection of the
Historical Society of St. Petersburg</cite>,
under the exalted patronage of the
czarovitch; without enumerating
the periodical publications issued
by societies which were already
existing, as at Moscow and elsewhere.</p>

<p>To arrange in some degree of
order the rapid notice which is all
we must permit ourselves, and
laying aside for the present any
consideration of periodical literature,
we will mention, in the first
place, the works upon Russian history
in general, ecclesiastical and
secular; then the various memoirs
and biographies; concluding with
bibliography, or the history of literature.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">General History of Russia.</span>&mdash;Amongst
the works which
treat of this subject, that of M. Soloviev
indisputably occupies the first
place. His <cite>History of Russia from
the Earliest Times</cite> (<cite>Istoria Rossiis
drevneichikh vremen</cite>) advances with
slow but steady pace, and has at this
time reached its twenty-third volume,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
embracing the second septennate
of the Empress Elizabeth, which
concludes with the year 1755&mdash;a
year memorable in the annals of
Russian literature, as witnessing the
establishment of the first Russian
university, namely, that of Moscow.
It is not surprising that this subject
has inspired the author, who is a
professor of the same university, to
write pages full of interest. With
regard to what he relates respecting
the exceedingly low level of civilization
to which the Russian clergy
had at that time sunk, other authors
have made it the subject of special
treatises, and with an amplitude of
development which could not have
found place in a general history.
M. Soloviev’s method is well
known&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, to turn to the advantage
of science the original documents,
for the most part inedited,
and frequently difficult of access
to the generality of writers. But
does he always make an impartial
use of them? This is a question.
The manner in which he has recounted
the law-suit of the Patriarch
Nicon&mdash;to cite this only as an
example&mdash;does not speak altogether
favorably for the historian; besides,
his history is too voluminous to be
accessible to the generality of readers;
and when it will be finished,
who can divine?</p>

<p>For this reason a complete history,
in accordance with recent
discoveries, and reduced to two or
three volumes, would meet with a
warm welcome. That of Oustrialov
is already out of date; the little
abridgment of M. Soloviev is too
short; and the work of M. Bestoujev-Rumine
remains at its first volume,
the two which are to follow,
and which have been long promised,
not having yet appeared.</p>

<p>M. Kostomarov, who has just
celebrated the 25th year of his literary
career, is also publishing a
<cite>History of Russia, Considered in the
Lives of its Principal Representatives</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
of which the interest increases
as the period of which it treats approaches
our own. Two sections
have already appeared. The first,
which is devoted to the history of
the house of S. Vladimir, embraces
four centuries; the second, as considerable
as its predecessor in
amount of matter, comprises no
more than the interval of about a
century&mdash;that is to say, the reigns
of Ivan the Terrible, his father, and
his grandfather (1462-1583). Faithful
to the plan he has adopted, the
author relates the life and deeds of
the most remarkable men, whether
in the political or social order:
thus, in the second section, after
the historical figures of Ivan III.,
Basil, and Ivan IV., we have the
Archbishop Gennadius, the monk
Nilus Sorski, whom the Russian
Church reckons among her saints:
the Prince Patrikeïev, the celebrated
Maximus, a monk of Mt. Athos,
and, lastly, the heretic Bachkine
with his sectaries. The first volume
will be terminated by the third
section, which will conclude the
history of the house of Vladimir.</p>

<p>This history meets with a violent
opponent and an implacable judge
in the person of M. Pogodine, the
veteran of Russian historians. The
antagonism of these two writers, M.
Pogodine and M. Kostomarov, is
of long standing. But never have
polemics taken a more aggressive
tone than on the present occasion;
and the aggression is on the part of
M. Pogodine, who accuses his adversary
of nothing more nor less than
mystifying the public and corrupting
the rising generation; of having
arbitrarily omitted the origin and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
commencement of the nation; of
throwing, by preference, into strong
relief all the dark pages of the history;
and, lastly, declares him to be
guilty of venality. To these charges
M. Kostomarov replies that his
censor is playing the part of a
policeman rather than of a critic;
that his arguments, like his anger,
inspire him with pity; and that the
most elementary rules of propriety
forbid him to imitate his language.
Coming to historical facts, he explains
the reasons for his silence on
the <em>pagan</em> period of Russian history;
for treating the call of Rurik as
a fable, together with a multitude
of other stories of the ancient chronicles;
for seeing in the Varangian<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
princes nothing but barbarians, and
the pagans of this period the same.
He also brings proofs to show that
Vladimir Monomachus was really
the first to seek allies among the
tribes of the Polovtsis; that Vassilko
caused the whole population of
Minsk to be exterminated; and
that Andrew Bogolubski was not by
any means beloved by the people,
as had been stated by M. Pogodine&mdash;these
three subjects being
among the principal points of dispute.</p>

<p>But we have no desire to pursue
any further details which cannot in
themselves have any interest for the
public, although, taken in connection
with the histories of the antagonistic
authors, they may be suggestive.
For instance, it is not easy
to forget what the ardent professor
of Moscow relates of himself with
reference to certain of his fellow-countrywomen
who had embraced
the Catholic faith. Being at Rome,
he tells us (and his words depict
in a lively manner the character of
his zeal) that he felt himself strongly
tempted to <em>seize by the hair</em> two
Russian ladies<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> whom he saw crossing
the Piazza di Spagna to enter
a Catholic church. He is said to
be at this time preparing a <cite>Campaign
against Adverse Powers</cite>, in which he
combats “historic heresies.”</p>

<p>But the services rendered by M.
Pogodine to the national history
are undoubtedly great. We may
notice a new one in his <cite>Ancient
History of Russia before the Mongolian
Yoke</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> in which, after grouping
the Russian principalities around
that of Kiev as their political centre
anterior to the invasion of the
Mongols, he also gives the separate
history of each. In the second
volume the church, literature, the
state, manners, and customs, are
treated upon in turn, and form a
series of pictures traced by a skilful
hand, closing with a terribly-vivid
description of the Tartar invasion.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Particular or Individual
History.</span>&mdash;It is about two years
since historical science in Russia
sustained a loss in the death of M.
Pékarski, who had scarcely reached
his forty-fifth year. This laborious
and learned writer, who, in so short
a space of time, produced an unusual
number of important works,<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
died after having just completed
his <cite>History of the Academy of Sciences</cite>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
This work contains about eighteen
hundred pages. After a solid introduction
there follow the biographies
of the first fifty members
of the Academy, all of whom were
foreigners, to which succeed those
of Trediakovski and Lomonosov.
In glancing over these biographies
one is struck with the preponderance
of the German element, the
Academy, at its commencement, being
almost exclusively composed of
learned men of that nation. With
the reign of Elizabeth the Russian
party began to take the lead, and it
was Lomonosov, the son of a fisherman
of Archangelsk, who was the
life and soul of it, as a learned man,
an historian, and a poet. Pékarski
mentions some curious details respecting
the correspondence between
Peter I. and the Sorbonne,
touching the reunion of the Russian
Church with Rome. It is to be
wished that the documents treating
of this matter, and which are preserved
in the archives of the academy,
might be published.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Ecclesiastical History.</span>&mdash;After
the <cite>History of the Russian
Church</cite>, by Mgr. Macarius, the present
Metropolitan of Lithuania,
which has just reached its seventh
volume, the first place is due to
that by M. Znamenski, entitled <cite>The
Parochial Clergy in Russia, subsequent
to the Reform of Peter I.</cite><a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> In
presence of the Protestant reforms
which are in course of introduction
into the official church by the Russian
government, M. Znamenski’s
book offers an eminently practical
interest, and it is greatly to be wished
that those in power would profit
by its serious teaching. The author
advances nothing without producing
his proofs, drawn from official
documents, which he has taken
great pains to search for and consult
wherever they were to be found.</p>

<p>His work is divided into five
chapters, the first of which treats
of the “Nomination of the Parochial
Clergy.” Down to the middle
of the XVIIIth century its members
were chosen on the elective
system; it is the ancient mode of
nomination, which existed also in
the Catholic Church. But from the
middle of the XVIIIth century this
gave place, in Russia, to the <em>hereditary</em>
system, which has become one
of the distinctive features of the Russian
communion,<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> and in which may
be found the cause of the separation
and the spirit of caste which from
that time began to isolate the clergy
from the rest of society, and made
them in all respects a body apart.</p>

<p>This spirit of caste still subsists,
though not in so perceptible a degree
as formerly. One inevitable
consequence of this Levitism was
the difficulty of quitting the caste
when once a person belonged to it,
as the author develops in his second
chapter (pp. 176-354). In the
third, he treats of the “Civil Rights
of the Clergy,” and there depicts the
revolting abuses in which the secular
authorities allowed themselves
with regard to the unfortunate clergy.
The arbitrary injustice to
which they were subjected during
the whole of the XVIIIth century,
and of which the still vivid traces
remained in the time of the Emperor
Alexander I., appears almost
incredible. For instance, a poor
parochial incumbent, having had
the misfortune to pass before the
house of the principal proprietor
of the place without having taken
off his hat to that personage, who
was on the balcony with company,
was immediately seized, thrust into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
a barrel, and thus rolled from the
top of the hill on which the seignorial
dwelling was situated, into the
river which flowed at its base. His
death was almost instantaneous.
Justice, as represented in that quarter,
being informed of this new species
of murder, found itself unequal
to touch the little potentate, and
hushed up the affair. Similar horrors
were by no means rare in the
XVIIIth century. In the fourth
chapter (pp. 507-617) the author
speaks of the “Relations of the
Clergy with the Ecclesiastical Authorities”;
and although the picture
he draws is somewhat less sombre
than the preceding, still it is melancholy
enough. Venality the most
systematic, and rigor that can hardly
be said to fall short of cruelty,
were, for more than half a century,
the most prominent features of the
ecclesiastical government. No post,
however small or humble, could be
obtained without the imposition of
a purely arbitrary tax; and these
taxes formed in the end a very considerable
amount. As for the spirit
of the government, its fundamental
maxim was to <em>hold down</em> the lower
clergy <em>in humility</em> (<i lang="ru">smirenié</i>)&mdash;a
formula which was imprinted on the
very bodies of the unfortunate victims.
The slightest fault or error
on their part was punished by corporal
chastisements so severe that
the sufferer sometimes expired under
the blows. Priests were treated
by their chief pastors as beings on
a level with the meanest of slaves.
One of these <i lang="ru">vladykas</i> (which is
the name by which the Russian
bishops are designated) condemned
his subordinates to dig fish-ponds
on his estate, which ponds were to
be so shaped as to form on a gigantic
scale the initials (E. B.) of his
lordship’s name.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>The failure of resources, so materially
diminished by the cupidity
of their superiors, forced the parochial
clergy to contrive for themselves
an income by means more
or less lawful. Besides the legal
charges, they invented various small
taxes on their own behalf; or, when
all else failed, they begged their
bread from their own parishioners,
who were apt to be more liberal of
reproaches than of alms. The well-being
of the secular clergy being
one of the questions under consideration
by the present government,
the author has devoted to it much
of his last chapter.</p>

<p>Such is the general plan of this
book, which must be read through
to give an idea of the humiliating
degradation to which the hapless
clergy were for more than a century
condemned, thanks to the
anomaly of institutions still more
than to the abuses practised by individuals.
When the source is
corrupt, can the stream be pure?</p>

<p>But all this relates to the “Orthodox”
of the empire. That which
is more directly interesting to the
Catholic reader will be found in
works respecting the Ruthenian<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
Church, which is at this time attracting
the attention of the West.</p>

<p>The <cite>History of the Reunion of
the Ancient Uniates of the West</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
by M. Koïalovitch, Professor of the
Ecclesiastical (Orthodox) Academy
of the capital, repeats the faults of
all the numerous writings, whether
books, pamphlets, or articles, which
have issued from his pen in the
course of the last ten years, and
which are painfully remarkable for
their spirit of partiality, their preconceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
ideas, their self-contradictions,
and their hatred of the
Catholic faith. An organ of the
press of St. Petersburg has expressed
a desire that the documents upon
which this author professedly
rests three-fourths of his last book,
while purposely neglecting all extraneous
sources whatever, whether
political or diplomatic, should be
given to the public, which would
then be enabled to judge for itself
how far the statements based upon
them are to be trusted. Nor can
any obstacle exist in the way of
such publication, as was shown by
the work of Moroehkine on the reunion
of the Uniates in 1839, equally
compiled from official documents
of unquestionable importance, which
were then edited for the first time.</p>

<p>It is impossible not to be struck
with the strange coincidence of so
many publications upon union with
the painful events which are taking
place at the present time in the
Diocese of Khelm, and which had
evidently been preparing long beforehand.
Books have their <i lang="fr">raison
d’être</i>&mdash;a reason for their appearance
at particular periods. It is
said, even, that M. Koïalovitch
is at the head of a school of
opinion, and that his disciples can
be pointed out without difficulty.
Thus, Rustchinski is the author of
a study on the <cite>Religious Condition
of the Russian People according to
Foreign Authors of the XVIth and
XVIIth Centuries</cite>; Nicolaïevski has
written on <cite>Preaching in the XVIth
Century</cite>; Demaïanovitch, on <cite>The
Jesuits in Western Russia, from
1569 to 1772</cite>, at which latter year
the thread of their history is taken
up and continued by Moroehkine;
Kratchkovski, on the <cite>Interior
State of the Uniate Church</cite> (1872);
and Stcherbinski has given the history
of the Order of S. Basil. But
we must not prolong the catalogue,
which, however, is by no means complete.
Never has so much literary
activity been known in the “Orthodox”
communion as now, if, perhaps,
we except the first times of the
union.</p>

<p>But before passing on to another
head we must not fail to mention,
as one of the principal representatives
of the literary movement of
the XVIth century, the celebrated
namesake and predecessor of the
present Metropolitan of Mesopotamia,
<i>i.e.</i>, Archbishop Macarius, to
whom we are indebted for the
monumental work known as the
<cite>Great Menology</cite>, and which is a
species of religious encyclopædia,
containing, besides the lives of the
saints for every day in the year, the
entire works of the early fathers,
as well as ascetic, canonical, and
literary treatises. The Archæographic
Commission of St. Petersburg
has undertaken the republication,
in its integrity, of this colossal work,
of which only three quarto volumes
in double columns have at present
appeared.</p>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">Biographies.</span>&mdash;As we have
already remarked, it is interesting
to observe the eagerness with which
the Russian people welcome everything
that tends to throw light upon
their past. For instance, what
is usually drier than a catalogue?
And yet the one compiled by M.
Méjov has already reached four
thousand copies. It is true that
his <cite>Systematic Catalogue</cite> (of original
documents) combines various qualities
that are somewhat rare in publications
of this description. It is
not, however, desirable that a taste
for the mere reproduction of inedited
manuscripts should be carried
too far; the interests of science demanding
rather that they should
be made use of in the production<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of works aspiring to greater completeness,
and suited to meet the
requirements of modern criticism.</p>

<p>A certain number of works have
already been written in accordance
with this idea. That of M. Tchistovitch,
entitled <cite>Theophanes Procopovitch
and his Times</cite>, may be
given as a model, as may also the
excellent study of M. Ikonnikov on
Count Nicholas Mordinhov, one of
the remarkable men who flourished
in the reign of the Emperor Alexander
I. and Nicholas. Various
memoirs of this personage had previously
appeared in different collections,
but no one before the young
professor of Kiev had taken the
trouble to study the original sources
upon which alone an authentic life
could be written, to reduce them
to system, and give them a living
form. It is not only the opinions
and theories of the count which are
given, but those also of contemporary
society and the persons by
whom he was surrounded, those of
the latter being occasionally too
lengthily developed. M. Ikonnikov
was also, some years ago, the
author of an interesting work, entitled
<cite>The Influence of Byzantine Civilization
on Russian History</cite> (Kiev:
1870). And this leads us to mention
a book recently published by
M. Philimonov, vice-director of the
Museum of Arms, on <cite>Simon Ouchakov
and the Iconography of his Time</cite>.</p>

<p>The name of this artist has
scarcely been heard in the West.
Born in 1626, he early evinced a
talent for painting, and at the age
of twenty-two was admitted into
the number of iconographists appointed
by the czar; his specialty
consisting in making designs, more
particularly for the gold-work appropriated
to religious uses. Of
his paintings, the earliest bears the
date of 1657. M. Philimonov passes
in review all his later productions,
accompanying each with a
short but careful notice, and dwelling
chiefly upon the two which he
considers the masterpieces of Russian
iconography at that period,
namely, the painting of the Annunciation
and that of Our Lady of
Vladimir. Besides these two principal
paintings, Ouchakov left a
quantity of others, most of which
bear his name, with the date of their
completion, although these indications
are not needed, his pictures
being easily recognizable. He
may, in fact, be considered as at
the head of a new school of painting,
taking the middle line between
the conventional Muscovite iconography
and the paintings of the
West; between the inanimate and
rigid formalism of the one and the
living variety of the other; and
thus inaugurating the new era in
religious art which manifested itself
in Russia with the opening of
the XVIIth century, and permitting
the introduction of a realism
which the ancient iconographers
were wholly ignorant of, and would
have considered it detrimental to
Oriental orthodoxy to countenance.
Ouchakov was ennobled, in honor
of his talents, and died in 1656, at
the age of sixty, in the full enjoyment
of public esteem.</p>

<p>In connection with the subject of
art, we may add that M. Philimonov
has just issued an elegant edition
of the <cite>Guide to Russian Iconography</cite>,
which teaches the correct manner
in which to represent the saints.
The text of this work, which is for
the first time published in Russian,
has been furnished by three of the
most ancient manuscripts known to
exist, one of which formerly belonged
to the Church of S. Sophia
of Novogorod. Fully to comprehend
the text, however, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
necessary to have together with it,
for constant reference, some pictorial
guide, as, for instance, the one
published by M. Boutovski. The
two works explain and complete
each other, as both alike refer to
about the same period; but, also,
both should be consulted in subordinate
reference to the Greek
<cite>Guide</cite>, if the reader is to be enabled
to separate the Byzantine element
from that which is specially characteristic
of Russian iconography.</p>

<p>In connection with general literature
mention must be made of
the fabulist, Khemnitzer, whose
complete works and correspondence
have been edited by Grote,
together with a biography, composed
from previously-unpublished
sources. After the vast labor of
editing the works of Derjavine,
those of Khemnitzer would be in
comparison a mere amusement to
the learned and indefatigable academician.</p>

<p>V. <span class="smcap">Journals and Memoirs.</span>&mdash;The
<cite>Journal of Khrapovski</cite> (1782-1793),
published by M. Barsoukov,
who has enriched it with a biographical
notice and explanatory
notes, appears for the first time in
its integrity, and accompanied by a
<i lang="fr">catalogue raisonné</i> of all the personages
who find themselves mentioned
in the text. This journal derives
its special interest and value
from the position of the author,
who for ten years was attached to
the <em>personal</em> service of the Empress
Catherine II. (<i lang="fr">Chargé des Affaires
Personnelles</i>), and who, being thus
admitted into the interior and
home-life of the court, noted down
day by day, and sometimes hour by
hour, all that he there saw or heard.
This is certainly not history; but
an intelligent historian will sometimes
find there, in a sentence
spoken apparently at random, the
germ of great political events which
were accomplished later.</p>

<p>The <cite>Journal of Lady Rondeau</cite>,
wife of the English resident-minister
at the court of the Empress
Anne, is the first volume of foreign
writers on the Russia of the
XVIIIth century, edited with notes
by M. Choubinski. The idea of
publishing the accounts of foreigners
on the Russian Empire merits
encouragement, and, if well carried
out, will shed new light on numberless
points which an indigenous author
would leave unnoticed, but
which have a real interest in the
eyes of a stranger. If it should be
objected that foreigners judge superficially
and partially, it is none
the less true that the worth of
their impressions arises precisely
from the diversity of country and
point of view. Besides, all strangers
could not, without injustice, be
alike charged with lightness and
inexactitude. The memoirs of
Masson on the court of Catherine
II. and of Paul I. are quoted by
the Russians themselves as a striking
proof to the contrary; no single
fact which he mentions having
been disproved by history. The
merit of Lady Rondeau’s book is
increased by the notice, in form of
an appendix, which is added by her
husband, on the character of each
of the principal personages of the
court.</p>

<p>We conclude this rapid and imperfect
summary by mentioning the
<cite>Catalogue of the Section of Russica</cite>,
or writings upon Russia in foreign
languages&mdash;a work of which the initiation
is due to the administrators
of the Public Library of St. Petersburg,
and forming two enormous
volumes. To give some idea of
the riches accumulated in the section
of <cite>Russica</cite>, perhaps unique in
the world, and of which the formation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
commenced in 1849, it will
suffice to say that the number of
works enumerated in the catalogue
reaches the figures 28,456, <em>without
reckoning</em> those composed in Lithuanian,
Esthonian, Servian, Bulgarian,
Greek, and other Oriental
languages, which will together form
a supplementary volume. Besides
original works, the catalogue indicates
all the translations of Russian
books, and enumerates all the periodicals
which have appeared in
Russia in foreign languages.</p>

<p>The works are arranged in alphabetical
order; but at the end
of the second volume we find an
analytical table, commencing with
history, the historical portion being
the most considerable one in
the section of <cite>Russica</cite>. Thus the
literary treasures possessed by the
principal library of the empire are
henceforward made known with
regard to each branch of the sciences
in relation to Russia. If to
this we add the <cite>Systematic Catalogue</cite>
of M. Méjov, mentioned above, we
possess the historic literature of
Russia in its completeness.</p>

<hr class="section" />

<h3>THE FIRST JUBILEE.</h3>

<p>Almighty God, who has “ordered
all things in measure and <em>number</em>
and weight” (Wisd. xi. 21), and who
teaches us, under the guidance of
his church, to observe sacred times
and seasons, has brought around
again the Holy Year of Jubilee,
during which an extraordinary indulgence
is granted by the Pope,
that sinners being led to repentance,
and the just increased in grace,
each one can hear it said to himself:
“In an <em>acceptable time</em> I have
heard thee” (Is. xlix. 8).</p>

<p>We will not touch here upon the
nature or doctrine of indulgences,
more than to give a definition of
our Jubilee, viz., a solemn plenary
remission of such temporal punishment
as may still be due to divine
justice after the guilt of sin has
been forgiven, which the Sovereign
Pontiff, in the fulness of apostolic
power, makes at a stated period to
all the faithful, on condition of
performing certain specified pious
works; empowering confessors to
absolve for the nonce in reserved
cases and from censures not specially
excepted, and to commute all
vows not likewise excepted into
other salutary matter. Our Holy
Father, Pius IX., by an Encyclical
Letter dated from S. Peter’s on the
vigil of last Christmas, has announced
that, the year 1875 completing
the cycle of time determined by his
predecessors for the recurrence of
the Jubilee, he declares it the Holy
Year, and sets forth the conditions
of the same, with other circumstances
of ecclesiastical discipline usual
on so rare an occasion of grace.</p>

<p>The origin of the word <em>jubilee</em> itself
is uncertain. It is a Hebrew
term that first occurs in the twenty-fifth
chapter of Leviticus: “And
thou shalt sanctify the fiftieth year,
… for it is the year of Jubilee.”
Josephus (<cite>Antiquit.</cite>, iii. 11) says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
that it means <em>liberty</em>, by which his
annotators understand that discharge
among the Jews from debts
and bondage, and restitution to
every man of his former property,
as commanded by the law. The
more common opinion derives it
from <i lang="he">jobel</i>, a ram’s horn, because
the Jubilee year was ushered in by
the blasts of the sacred trumpets,
made of the horns of the ram.
Pope Boniface VIII. is erroneously
supposed by many to have instituted
the Christian Jubilee; for he
only restored what had already existed,
and reduced it substantially
to its present form; inasmuch as
there had been from an early period
a custom among Christians of
visiting Rome at the turn of every
succeeding century, in the hope of
obtaining great spiritual favors at
the tomb of S. Peter, and perhaps
also with the idea of atoning in
some measure for the superstitious
secular games which during the
reign of Augustus the <i lang="la">Quindecimviri</i>
(a college of priests) announced as
having been given once in every
century in memory of the foundation
of the Eternal City, and which,
after consulting the Sibylline books
in their care, they prevailed upon
the emperor to celebrate again.
Mgr. Pompeo Sarnelli, Bishop of
Bisceglie in 1692, treats of the
secular year of the heathen Romans
and the Jubilee of their Christian descendants
together, as though one
were in some respect a purified outgrowth
of the other. He says:
“But the Christians, to change profane
into sacred things, were accustomed
to go every hundredth year
to visit the Vatican basilica, and
celebrate the memory of Christ, who
was born for the redemption of the
world; so that the Holy Year was
the sanctification of the profane
centenary in the lapse of time;
but in its spiritual benefits it perfected
the effects of the Jubilee
kept by the Jews every fiftieth year
for temporal advantages” (<cite>Lettere
Ecclesiast.</cite>, x. 50). Macri also, in
his <cite>Hiero-lexicon</cite> (1768), says: “We
believe that the popes who have always
endeavored (when the nature
of the thing permitted) to alter the
vain observances of the Gentiles
into sacred ceremonies for the worship
of God, in order to eradicate
the superstitious secular year of
the Romans, established our Holy
Year of Jubilee, and enriched it
with indulgences.” Of the connection
between our Jubilee and that
of the Jews Devoti (<cite>Inst. Can.</cite>, ii.
p. 250, note) remarks that their fiftieth
year “aliquo modo imago fuit
Jubilæi, quem postea Romani Pontifices
instituerunt&mdash;” was in some
wise a figure of that Jubilee which,
at a later period, the Roman pontiffs
instituted.</p>

<p>Benedetto Gaetani of Anagni
(Boniface VIII.) had been elected
pope at Naples on Dec. 24, 1294,
and was residing in Rome at the
close of the century, when he heard
towards Christmas that many pilgrims
were approaching the city,
who came, they said, to gain the
indulgence which an ancient tradition
taught could be obtained there
every hundredth year, at the beginning
of a new century. Although
search was made in the pontifical
archives for some record of a concession
of special indulgence at
such a period, none was found;
but witnesses of established veracity
assured the pope that they
had heard of this indulgence, and
that it was connected with a visit
to the tomb of S. Peter.</p>

<p>Brocchi in his <cite>Storia del Giubbileo</cite>,
page 6, mentions among the venerable
persons examined before the
pope and cardinals one man 107<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
years old, and another&mdash;a noble
Savoyard&mdash;over 100 years old, who
both made deposition that as children
they had been brought to
Rome by their parents, who had often
reminded them not to omit the
pilgrimage of the next century, if
they should live so long. Two very
aged Frenchmen from the Diocese
of Beauvais also deposed to having
come to Rome on the strength
of a like centennial tradition of
which they had heard their fathers
speak. The chronicler William Ventura
of Asti (born in 1250) writes
that at the beginning of the year
1300 an immense crowd of pilgrims,
coming to Rome from the East and
from the West, used to throng
about the pope and cry out: “Give
us thy blessing before we die; for
we have learnt from our elders that
all Christians who shall visit on the
hundredth year the basilica where
rest the bones of the apostles Peter
and Paul can obtain absolution of
their sins and the remission of any
penance that might still be due for
them” (apud Muratori, <cite>Rer. Ital.
Script.</cite>, xi. 26). Boniface VIII.
then called a consistory, and on the
advice of the cardinals determined
to issue a bull confirming the grant
of indulgence, did such really exist;
and in any case offering a
plenary indulgence to all who, contrite,
should confess their sins and
visit at least once a day for thirty
days&mdash;not necessarily consecutive,
if Romans; if strangers, only for fifteen
days in the same manner&mdash;the
two basilicas of the holy apostles SS.
Peter and Paul during the course
of the year 1300. This interesting
bull, which is usually cited by its
opening words, <i lang="la">Antiquorum habet
fida relatio</i>, and may be seen in any
collection of canon law among the
<cite>Extravagantes Communes</cite> (lib. v.
De Pœn. et Rem., c. 1), is short
and elegantly condensed&mdash;for which
reason, perhaps, an old glossarist
calls it “epistola satis grossè composite”&mdash;and,
although written before
the revival of Latin letters,
compares favorably with the verbose
composition of later documents. It
was probably drawn up by Sylvester,
the papal secretary, who is named
as writer of the circular-letter sent
in the pope’s name to all bishops
and Christian princes to acquaint
them with the measure taken, and
invite them to exhort the faithful
of their dioceses and their loyal
subjects to go on the pilgrimage
Romeward. The pope published
his bull himself on the 22d of February,
1300, being the feast of S.
Peter at Antioch, by reading it
aloud from a richly-draped <em>ambon</em>
erected for the occasion before the
high altar in S. Peter’s, which had a
very different appearance from the
domed and cross-shaped structure
that we now admire, as lovers of
architectural elegance; for as antiquarians
we must regret the venerable
building which was a <i lang="el">basilica</i>
in form as well as in name. When
Boniface had finished, he descended,
and went up in person to the
altar to deposit upon it the bull of
indulgence in homage to the Prince
of the Apostles, whose successor he
was, and not unworthily maintained
himself to be. Then returning to
his former place, while the cardinals
stood with bended head around
it and beneath him, he gave his
solemn blessing to an immense
number of pilgrims, who, filling the
church and overflowing into the
square in front, reverentially knelt
to receive it. Truly, the hearts of
the people were with that man, although
the hands of princes were
against him. A most interesting
memorial of this very scene has
been preserved to us through sack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
and fire for nearly six hundred
years in the shape of a painting by
the celebrated Giotto&mdash;a portrait,
too, and not a fancy sketch&mdash;which
is the only portion saved of the
beautiful frescos with which he ornamented
the <i lang="it">loggia</i> built by Boniface
at S. John Lateran. It represents
the pope in the act of giving
his benediction to the people between
two cardinals (or, as some
critics think, two prelates), one of
whom holds a document in his
hand&mdash;evidently meant for the bull
of Jubilee by an artist’s license, to
specify more distinctly the circumstance;
for it was then actually on
the altar&mdash;while the other looks
down upon the crowd over the
hanging cloth on which the Gaetani
arms are emblazoned. This
specimen of higher art of the XIVth
century was for a long time preserved
in the cloister of S. John, until a
representative of the Gaetani (now
ducal) family had it carefully set
up against one of the pilasters of
the church, and protected with a
glass covering, in 1786, where it
may still be seen, although it is
not often noticed according to its
merits.</p>

<p>Our chief authorities for the details
of this Jubilee are the pope’s
nephew, James Cardinal Stefaneschi;
the Chronicler of Asti (generally
quoted as <cite>Chronicon Astense</cite>);
and the Florentine merchant
and Guelph historian, John Villani,
who died of the plague in 1348.
All were eye-witnesses.</p>

<p>The cardinal wrote on the Jubilee
in prose and verse. His work,
<cite>De centesimo, seu Jubilæo anno Liber</cite>,
is published in the <cite>Biblioth. Max.
Patrum</cite>, tom. xxv. He is the earliest
writer to use the word <em>jubilee</em>,
which is not found in the pope’s
bull, but must have been common
at the period, for others use it. A
sententious specimen of the cardinal
deacon’s prose style may be interesting;
it contains a good sentiment,
and is not bad Latin, although
the German Gregorovius,
in his <cite>History of Rome in the Middle
Ages</cite>, speaks of “die barbarische
Schrift des Jacob Stefaneschi”&mdash;“that
barbarous opuscule of James
Stefaneschi”: “Beatus populus qui
scit Jubilationem; infelices vero qui
torpore, vel temeritate, dum alterius
sibi forsan ævum Jubilæi spondent,
neglexerint” (cap. xv.)&mdash;“Blessed
is the people that profiteth by
this season of remission; but unhappy
are the slothful and presumptuous
ones who, promising
themselves another Jubilee, neglect
it.” His hexameters, however, are
undoubtedly execrable; for instance:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Cardinal James of the Title of
S. George <em>in Velabro</em> was one of the
most distinguished men of Rome;
“famous,” as Tiraboschi says (<cite>Letterat.
Ital.</cite>, v. 517), “not less for
his birth than for his learning.”
His mother was an Orsini. He
died in 1343.</p>

<p>As soon as the grant of this great
indulgence was noised abroad an
extraordinarily large number of pilgrims
set out from all parts of Italy,
from Provence and France, from
Spain, Germany, Hungary, and
even from England, although not
very many from that country, which
was then at war. They came of
every age, sex, and condition: children
led by the hand or carried in
the arms, the infirm borne in litters,
the knightly and those of more
means on horseback, while not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
few old people were seen, Anchises-like,
supported on the shoulders of
their sons. <cite>The Chronicle of Parma</cite>
(quoted by Gregorovius, <cite>Geschichte
der Stadt Rom im Mittelalter</cite>, v. p.
549) says that “every day and at
all hours there was a sight as of
a general army marching in and
out by the Claudian Way,” which
brought the pilgrims into the city
after joining the Flaminian Way at
the gate now represented by the
Porta del Popolo; and the Chronicler
of Asti has to use the words of the
Apocalypse to describe the throngs
that gathered about the roaring
gates. “I went out one day,” he
says, and “I saw a great crowd
which no man could number.”
The whole influx of pilgrims, including
men and women, during the
year, was computed by the Romans
at over two millions; while Villani,
who was a careful observer, writes
that about thirty thousand people
used to enter and leave the city
every day, there being at no time
less than two hundred thousand
within the walls over and above the
fixed population. But the pilgrimage
was especially one of the poor
to the tomb of the Fisherman; and
all writers on it have remarked, in
noticing the fervent enthusiasm of
the common people, the cold reserve
and absence of their royal
masters. Only the Frenchman
Charles Martel, titular King of Hungary,
came; it is presumable more
to obtain the pope’s good-will in the
dispute about the succession to the
throne than from piety. The nearest
approach to royalty after him
was Charles of Valois, who came
accompanied by his family and a
courtly retinue of five hundred
knights, and doubtless hoped to
receive the crown of Sicily from
Boniface, if he could expel the
usurping Aragonese.</p>

<p>So many thousands of pilgrims,
citizens and strangers, went day and
night to S. Peter’s that not a few
were maimed, and some even trampled
to death, in the struggling
crowd of goers and comers that
met at the crossing of the Tiber
over the old Ælian bridge leading
to the Leonine city. To obviate
such disasters in future, the wide
bridge was divided lengthwise by a
strong wooden railing, thus forming
two passages, of which the advancing
and returning pilgrims took respectively
the one on their right.
The poet Dante, who is strongly supposed
to have been in Rome for the
Jubilee, although there is no proof
either in the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite> or the
<cite>Vita Nuova</cite> that he was, may have
written as an eye-witness when he
describes this very scene of the
passing but not mingling streams of
human beings in the well-known
lines:</p>

<p>The castle here mentioned is, of
course, Sant’ Angelo; and the hill
is probably Monte Giordano, in the
heart of the city, which, although,
from the grading of the surrounding
streets, is now only a gentle rise
graced by the Gabrielli palace, was
a high and strongly-fortified position
in the XIVth century. Among
all the relics seen by the pilgrims in
Rome, the Holy Face of our Lord,
or Cloth of Veronica, which is preserved
with so much veneration in
S. Peter’s, seems to have attracted
the most attention. By order of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the pope it was solemnly shown to
the people on every Friday and
on all the principal feasts throughout

Tuscan has also sung of this, which
he possibly saw himself:</p>

<p>A modern economist might wonder
how a famine was to be averted,
with such a sudden and numerous
addition to the population of the
city. The foresight of the energetic
pope, whose family also was
influential in the very garden of
the Campagna, among those hardy
laborers of whom Virgil sung,
“Quos dives Anagnia pascit,” had
early in the year caused an immense
supply of grain, oats, meat,
fish, wine, and other sorts of
provision for man and beast to be
collected from every quarter and
brought into the city, where it was
stored and guarded against the
coming of the pilgrims. The provisions
were abundant and cheap.
The Chronicler of Asti, it is true,
complains of the dearness of the
hay or fodder for his horse; but as
he thought <i lang="la">tornesium unum grossum</i>
(equal to six cents of our money)
too high for his own daily lodging
and his horse’s stabling, without
bait, we must think either that the
means of living in Italy in those
days were incredibly low, or that
Ventura was very parsimonious. It
is the testimony of all the writers
on this Jubilee that, except an
inundation of the Tiber, which
threatened for a few days to cut off
the train of supplies for the city,
everything was propitious to the
comfort and piety of the faithful.
The roads through Italy leading to
Rome were safe, at least to the
pilgrims, to whom a general safe-conduct
was given by the various
little republics and principalities
of the Peninsula; and if the Romans
did grow rich off of the strangers,
there was good-humor on both sides,
and not the slightest collision. Indeed,
the Romans (who perhaps
gained the Jubilee before the great
body of the pilgrims had arrived;
at least we know that those out of
the northern parts of Europe timed
their departure from home so as to
avoid the sweltering southern heat)
seem to have shown some indifference
to the spiritual favors offered;
as Gregorovius&mdash;who, however, is
anti-papal&mdash;with a quiet sarcasm
says: “They left the pilgrims to
pray at the altars, while they marched
with flaunting banners against
the neighboring city of Toscanella”;
and Galletti, in his <cite>Roman
Mediæval Inscriptions</cite> (tom. ii. p. 4),
has published a curious old one on
this martial event, the original of
which is now encased in one of the
inside walls of the Palazzo dei
Conservatori (this name may have
been changed by the present usurpers)
on the Capitoline hill, where
it was set up under Clement X.
in 1673. As it is most interesting
for its synchronism with the
first Jubilee, and the insight it
gives us into the mixed sort of
fines imposed by the descendants
of the conquerors of the world
upon a subjugated people in the
middle ages&mdash;bags of wheat, a bell,
the city gates, eight lusty fellows to
dance while their masters piped,
and a gentle hint that there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
<em>no salt sown</em>&mdash;we think it might well
appear (doubtless for the first time)
in an American periodical. The
original being in the abbreviated
style of the XIVth century, we
have modernized it to make it
more intelligible to the reader:</p>

<p>The meaning of the tenth, eleventh,

not object to any amount of <i lang="la">quattrim</i>
(coin), if the vanquished
should prefer, they may pay once
for all a thousand pounds in money,
instead of the annual tribute of
two thousand sacks of grain&mdash;with
freight charges to destination; and
the last lines signify that a sum is
laid up in the chapel to be used to
carry on another war if the Tuscanellans
should again machinate
against the City&mdash;as Rome was
proudly called&mdash;or refuse to fulfil
the stipulations.</p>

<p>The pilgrims of the Jubilee generally
made a small offering at the
altars of the two basilicas, although
no alms were required as a condition
of gaining the indulgence; and
it is particularly from a <i lang="fr">naïve</i> passage
of one of them in his valuable
chronicle that Protestants and Voltaireans
have taken occasion to deride
the Jubilees as mere money-making
affairs; and even the Catholic
Muratori (<cite>Antichità Italiane</cite>,
tom. iii. part ii. p. 156) carps at the
inimitable description of so Romanesque
a scene as that of two chatting
clerics raking in the oblations of the
<i lang="it">forestieri</i>; but Cenni, the annotator
of this great work of the Modenese
historian in the Roman edition of
1755, which we use, aptly remarks
here that if writers will look only at
the bad side of the many and almost
innumerable events that have
occurred in this low world of ours,
and illogically conclude from a particular
to the universal, they will
discover that art of putting things
whereby what has generally been
considered good and laudable will
appear thereafter worthy only of
censure. The Chronicler of Asti,
certainly with no great thought of
what people would think five hundred
years after he was mouldering
in his grave, simply writes of the
pilgrims’ donations: “Papa innumerabilem
pecuniam ab eisdem recepit,
quia die ac nocte duo clerici
stabant ad altare sancti Petri, tenentes
in eorum manibus rastellos
rastellantes pecuniam infinitam.”</p>

<p>Although we believe that the
honest Chronicler of Asti deserves
credit for taking notes at the Jubilee,
yet this very passage, read in
connection with the other one about
the dearness of his living, shows us
that he was one of those pious but
penurious souls who, if he had lived
in our day, and a gentleman called
on him for a subscription, would
beg to be permitted to wait until
the list got down very low. The
Protestant Gregorovius has shown
that these exaggerated offerings
“were for the most part only small
coin, the gift of common pilgrims”;
while the Catholic Von Reumont
(<cite>Geschichte der Stadt Rom</cite>, vol. ii. p.
650) has calculated that this “infinite
amount of money” was only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
after all equal to about two hundred
and forty thousand Prussian thalers,
which would make no more than
one hundred and seventy-five thousand,
two hundred dollars. When
the pope knew how generous were
the offerings of the faithful, he ordered
the entire sum to be expended
on the two basilicas, in buying
property to support the chapter of
the one and the monastery attached
to the other, and in those thousand
and more other expenses which
only those who have lived in Rome
can understand to be necessary to
support the majesty of divine worship
within such edifices. Surely,
it was better, in any case, that the
money of the pilgrims should go for
the glory of the saints and the embellishment
of God’s temples than
be exacted at home by cruel barons
and ruthless princes to carry on
their petty wars or strengthen their
castles.</p>

<p>Mr. Hemans (no friend to our
Rome), in his <cite>Mediæval Christianity
and Sacred Art</cite> (vol. i. p.
474), says, after mentioning these
“heaps of coins”: “If much of this
went into the papal treasury, it is
manifest that the expenditure from
that source for the charities exercised
throughout this holy season
must also have been great.” This
is a lame statement; because, although
on the one hand the large
subventions of the pope to the poor
pilgrims are certain, on the other
there is no proof whatever that <em>any</em>
alms they gave went into his “treasury.”
The pope, indeed, having
at heart the comfort of the strangers
and the beauty of the city, put
up many new buildings and made
other improvements, such as the
beautiful Gothic <i lang="it">loggia</i> of S. John
of Lateran, which the greatest painter
of the age was commissioned to
decorate with frescos (Papencordt,
<cite>Rom im Mittelalter</cite>, p. 336). It is
perhaps from a traditionary knowledge
of these architectural propensities
of the pope during the Jubilee
year, and of his endowments to the
basilicas, that so many people have
quite erroneously believed the sombre
but picturesque old farm-buildings
of Castel Giubileo, which crown
the green and lonely hill where more
than two thousand years ago the Arx
of Fidenæ stood a rival to the Capitol
of Rome, to be a memorial of, and
to get its designation from, this
Jubilee of A.D. 1300. Even Sir
Wm. Gell (<cite>Top. of Rome</cite>, p. 552)
repeats the old story. But the
more careful Nibby (<cite>Dintorni di
Roma</cite>, vol. ii. p. 58) has demonstrated,
with the aid of a document in
the archives of the Vatican basilica,
that the name of this place between
the Via Salaria and the Tiber, five
miles from Rome, is derived from
that of a Roman family which acquired
the site (previously called
Monte Sant’ Angelo) and built the
castle in the XIVth century; and
that it did not come into the possession
of the chapter of S. Peter
until the 16th of December, 1458,
when it was bought for the sum of
three thousand golden ducats. So
much for an instance of jumping at
conclusions from a mere similarity
of name, put together with something
else, which is so common a
fault of antiquaries.</p>

<h3>GREVILLE AND SAINT-SIMON.</h3>

<p>Mr. Charles Greville was not
a La Bruyère,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> but, as he appears in
his <cite>Memoirs</cite>, he might have sat very
well for that portrait of Arrias
which the inimitable imitator of
Theophrastus has drawn in his
chapter on society and conversation:
“Arrias has read everything,
has seen everything; at least he
would have it thought so. ’Tis a
man of universal knowledge, and
he gives himself out as such; he
would sooner lie than be silent or
appear ignorant of anything.…
If he tells a story, it is less to inform
those who listen than to have
the merit of telling it. It becomes
a romance in his hands; he makes
people think after his own manner;
he puts his own habits of speaking
in their mouths; and, in fine, makes
them all as talkative as himself.
What would become of him and of
them, if happily some one did not
come in to break up the circle and
contradict the whole story?”</p>

<p>This exact picture of the late
clerk of H.B.M. Privy Council
might have been written the morning
after his <cite>Memoirs</cite> appeared in
the London bookstores, instead of
nearly two hundred years ago. It
is at once a proof of the penetrating
genius of La Bruyère, and a
photograph every one will recognize
of the author of the journal which
has lately made so much noise in
society. This clever Newmarket
jockey&mdash;<i lang="la">rebus Newmarketianis versatus</i>,
as he says of himself&mdash;to whom
every point of the betting book is
familiar, carelessly refreshes his
jaded intellect with the <cite>Life of
Mackintosh</cite>, as he rides down in his
carriage to the races. With affable
profusion he scatters broadcast to
the mob of readers scraps of Horace
and Ovid, mingled with the latest
odds on the Derby. He has seen
everything from S. Giles’s to S.
Peter’s, and, with the <i lang="fr">blasé</i> air of a
man at once of genius and fashion,
proclaims “there is nothing in it.”
He knows everything, from the
most questionable scandal of the
green-room to the best plan of
forming a cabinet; such second-rate
men as Melbourne, Palmerston, and
Stanley he sniffs at with easy disdain;
and if at times he gently bemoans
a few personal deficiencies,
it is with a complacent conviction
that it needed only a little early
training to have made him a Peel,
a Burke, or a Chatham! That he
would “sooner lie than be silent,”
one needs only remember his infamous
stories about Mrs. Charles
Kean and Lady Burghersh; his calumnies
against George IV. and William
IV.&mdash;the masters whose gracious
kindness he repaid by bribing
their <i lang="fr">valets</i> for evidence against them&mdash;his
unfounded attacks upon Peel,
Stanley, O’Connell, and Lyndhurst;
his slanders even against obscure
men, like Wakley and others. As to
his habit of “making people think
after his own manner,” and putting
“his own mode of speaking in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
mouths,” the profanity and vulgarity
which disfigure his pages are the
best evidence.</p>

<p>That this is a true estimate of
the merits of <cite>The Greville Memoirs</cite>
is now generally admitted. The
most respectable critical exponents
of English opinion have united in
condemning the bad taste and
breach of trust which made either
their composition or publication
possible. It needs no refinement
of reasoning to prove that the
expressions everywhere so freely
quoted from this journal are such
as could not honorably be uttered
by any gentleman holding the office
Mr. Greville did. Readers will
easily be found for them, either
from a love of sensation or because
of the illustration they offer of the
character of the persons described
or the writer; but nothing can condone
their real offensiveness. Such,
however, was far from being the
first opinion of the press. The
leading English journal, in two
lengthy reviews such as rarely appear
in its columns, handled Mr.
Greville’s work with a delicacy, an
admiration, a regretful and half-tender
daintiness of touch for the
author, that promised everything to
the reader. This criticism was
followed by a general outburst of
applause on the part of the press,
which soon began to waver, however,
when it was found that the
best section of English society regarded
the book with disapproval.</p>

<p>So conscious, indeed, were the
American publishers of its intrinsic
lack of interest or literary merit
that one firm has presented it to
the public with nearly all the political
portions left out and the private
gossip retained. “It is said,” says
the <cite>Saturday Review</cite> not long ago,
“that an American compiler has
published a pleasant duodecimo
volume containing only those passages
which may be supposed to
gratify a morbid taste.” The
London critic intended, no doubt,
to be pungent and satirical; but
how innocuously does such satire
fall upon the head of the average
“compiler”!</p>

<p>If Mr. Greville has not made
good his claim to stand among the
masters of his craft, least of all is he
to be named in the same day with
the prince of memoir-writers&mdash;Saint-Simon;
unless, indeed, it be to
point the moral that more is needed
for excellency in such an art
than an inquisitive mind and a biting
pen. Yet Mr. Greville’s opportunity
was great&mdash;greater, probably,
than will happen to any other memoir-writer
for some generations to
come. Like Saint-Simon, he began
active life in an age of great
events and great men. Whatever
may be said of the pettiness of
the regency, of its profligacy and
mock brilliancy, no one can forget
that those were days of great perils;
of vast struggles, military and
civil; of giants’ wars, and of a race
of combatants not unworthy to
take part in them. Nor were the
twenty years succeeding&mdash;which
make up, as we may roughly say,
that portion of his journal now
printed&mdash;wanting in great interests
and momentous events. The age
which gave birth to Catholic Emancipation
and the Reform Bill, while
it still numbered among its chiefs the
veterans of the great Continental
war, could not fail to offer subjects
for treatment that would be read
eagerly by all succeeding times. If
Saint-Simon witnessed the culmination
of the glories of the reign of
Louis XIV., and saw De Luxembourg
and Catinat, the last survivors
of that line of victorious marshals
beginning with the great Condé<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
and Turenne, who had carried the
lilies of France over Europe, not
less was it Greville’s fortune to
converse familiarly with the great
duke who, repeating the triumphs
of Marlborough, had beaten down
the arms of the empire in a later
age. And if Saint-Simon lived also
to see the disasters, the weakness,
the desolation, and bankruptcy of
his country which succeeded the
long splendor of his youth, Greville
too looked on as a spectator,
almost, one might say, as a registrar,
at the hardly less terrible civil
struggles and social depression
which threatened to rend the kingdom
asunder.</p>

<p>Both were of noble families, although
the Duc de Saint-Simon was
the head of his house, and Mr.
Greville only a cadet of his. Both
were courtiers; and although Saint-Simon’s
position as a peer of France
lifted him far above Greville’s in
his day, who was rather a paid servant
of the crown than strictly a
courtier, yet the very office of the
latter gave him advantages which
the elder memoir-writer did not
always possess. Here, however, all
parallel ceases. The radical incapacity
of Mr. Greville’s mind to
lift him above the common race of
diarists prevents all further comparison.
He had neither the genius
of assimilation nor description
to make the portraits of men and
manners live, like Saint-Simon’s, in
the gallery of history. His informants
are <i lang="fr">valets</i>, his satire mere
backbiting, his reflections trivial,
his descriptions a confused mass
of petty details.</p>

<p>It is not proposed here to weary
the reader with long quotations
from a work which so many already
have read or skimmed over. Nor
do we intend, on the other hand, to
follow the fashion of some critics,
and carefully gather up all the points
which might be woven into an indictment
against Mr. Greville’s honor
or candor or wit. Such a task
would be endless; it would take
in almost every other page of his
volumes. But that it may be seen
that the unfavorable opinion which,
after a careful examination, we
have been led&mdash;much to our disappointment&mdash;to
entertain of his
work is not misplaced, we shall
proceed to give some passages that
sustain, in our judgment, the correctness
of the view we have taken.</p>

<p>Charles C. F. Greville was, as his
editor, Mr. H. Reeve, informs us, the
eldest son of Mr. Charles Greville,
grandson of the Earl of Warwick,
and Lady Charlotte Bentinck,
daughter of the Duke of Portland.
He was born in 1794. At the age
of nineteen he was appointed
private secretary by Earl Bathurst,
and almost at the same time family
influence procured for him a clerkship
in the Board of Trade. Both
offices had comfortable salaries attached
to them; neither of them
any duties. Thus at the outset of
his career, fortunate in his family
influence and his friends, Mr. Greville
was started, fairly equipped,
on the road of life. Unencumbered
by any responsibility, nor weighed
down by that sharp and bitter load
of poverty that men of humbler
birth have commonly to carry on
their galled shoulders, while they
strive to gain an insecure foothold
on the slippery road to fame or fortune,
he had every incentive and
every advantage to secure success.
A subject for thanksgiving, shall we
say, to this accomplished sinecurist?
By no means! Years afterwards he
bemoans the fact that he had nothing
to do, no spur to honorable
ambition. He forgot that at the same
or an earlier age Saint-Simon, whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
he appears to have read only to copy
his sometimes coarse language, was
handling a pike as a volunteer in
the service of his king, and carrying
sacks of grain on his shoulders to
the starving troops in the trenches
at Namur, disdaining those little
offices into which Greville insinuated
himself as soon as he left college.
Or if it be said&mdash;what no man could
then (1812) predict&mdash;that the war
was nearly over, and there was little
prospect of another, what was there
to prevent him from seeking a place
in Parliament&mdash;not hard to gain with
his family influence&mdash;and there
carving out for himself a place like
that of Burke, to whom he sometimes
lifts his eyes? The truth is,
to use a vulgar phrase, Mr. Greville
had “other fish to fry.” He knew
well he had other easier and more
profitable game to follow. He was
scarcely of age when the influence
of his uncle, the Duke of Portland,
obtained for him the sinecure office
of Secretary of Jamaica, a deputy
being allowed to reside in the island;
better still, the same influential
relative secured him the reversion
of the clerkship of the Council!
Henceforward not the camp nor
parliamentary struggles occupied
Mr. Greville’s mind; the glorious
task of “waiting for a dead man’s
shoes,” varied by the congenial
study of the stables, occupied that
powerful intellect which, in these
<cite>Memoirs</cite>, looks down with contempt
on all the names most distinguished
in European statesmanship during
the first half of this century. The
office fell to him in 1821, and he
continued to hold it for nearly forty
years. The net income of the two
offices, we are elsewhere informed,
amounted to about four thousand
pounds; and as he died worth thirty
thousand pounds, the charitable
supposition of the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>
is that “probably he was a gainer
on the turf.” He died in 1865.</p>

<p>The bent of Mr. Greville’s genius
was early shown.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Sunt quos curriculo pulverem Olympicum</div>
<div class="verse">Collegisse juvat.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The clerk of the Council was one
of them. The blue ribbon of the
turf, not parliamentary honors or
the long vigil of laborious nights&mdash;except
over the card-table&mdash;was the
centre around which his ambition
and aspirations circled. Early smitten
by the betting fever, he became
as nearly a professional turfman as
the security of his office would permit;
and there is something ludicrous
in those expressions of regret,
which have drawn such tender sympathy
from his critics, that he gave
himself up to the passion instead
of becoming the scholar or statesman
he is always hinting he might
have been. Mr. Greville, in fact,
makes the blunder of supposing
that the craving for fame is equivalent
to the faculty for winning it.
Not the turf, but original defect of
capacity, hindered him from being
more than he was&mdash;a clerk with a
taste for gambling, held in check by
a shrewd eye for the odds. His
contemporary, the late Lord Derby,
whom he seldom lets pass without
a sneer in these <cite>Memoirs</cite>, was an
example showing that, had true
genius existed, a taste for the turf
without participation in gambling,
need not have prevented him from
becoming both an accomplished
scholar and a brilliant statesman.</p>

<p>An early entry in Mr. Greville’s
journal gives the measure of the
man. Under date of February 23,
1821, he says:</p>

<p>“Yesterday the Duke of York
proposed to me to take the management
of his horses, which I accepted.
Nothing could be more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
kind than the manner in which he
proposed it.”</p>

<p>“March 5.&mdash;I have experienced a
great proof of the vanity of human
wishes. In the course of three
weeks I have attained the three
things I have most desired in the
world for years past, and upon the
whole I do not feel that my happiness
is increased.”</p>

<p>This is a good example, but far
from the best of its kind, of that
vein of apparently philosophical reflection
running here and there
through his journal, with which
Mr. Greville deliberately intended,
we believe, to hoodwink the critics,
and in which anticipation he has
been wonderfully successful. Coolly
examined, it resolves itself as nearly
as possible into a burlesque.
His reflections, as La Bruyère says
elsewhere of a like genius, “are generally
about two inches deep, and
then you come to the mud and
gravel.” What were the three
highest objects of human ambition
in the mind of this ardent young
man of twenty-seven, with the
world before him to choose from?
1st. A berth in the civil service to
creep into for the rest of his life.
2d. The place of head jockey and
trainer in the prince’s stables. 3d.
Unknown.</p>

<p>Alas! poor Greville, that the
bubble of life should have burst so
soon, leaving thee flat on thy back
in a barren world, after having thus
airily mounted to such imperial
heights! Had either Juvenal or
Johnson known thy towering ambition
and thy fall, he would have
placed thee side by side with dire
Hannibal or the venturous Swede
“to point a moral or adorn a
tale”!</p>

<p>It is wonderful, however, how
easily the diarist lays aside his
philosophic tone to take up the
more congenial <i lang="fr">rôle</i> of a spy upon
the kings whose names are so ostentatiously
displayed on his title-page,
and from whose service alone
he derived all the consideration he
had.</p>

<p>On January 12, 1829, Lord
Mount Charles comes to him for
some information. Thereupon, under
the guise of friendship and confidence,
he avows with a curious
shamelessness that he proceeded
to interrogate his visitor about
George IV.’s private life and habits.
When he has got all he wants out
of the unsuspecting Mount Charles,
he sets it down in his journal and
winds up with this reflection, everywhere
quoted: “A more contemptible,
cowardly, selfish, unfeeling dog
does not exist than this king.” These
were strong words to apply to a sovereign
whose bread he was eating,
and who had always personally treated
him with marked confidence and
kindness. Perhaps those who read
Mr. Greville’s journal with attention,
and note the slow portrait he
therein unconsciously draws of
himself, will be better able to judge
where the terms more aptly apply.
As a work of art, indeed, the journalist’s
picture of himself is far superior
to anything else in his book.
Touch by touch he elaborates his
own character. It is not a flattering
one; it was never revealed to
the artist. How pitiably does this
coarse generalization of Greville’s
compare with the fine but vigorous
and indelible strokes of Saint-Simon’s
pencil in his portrait of
Louis XIV.! It is not a character,
but a gross and clumsy invective.</p>

<p>But Mr. Greville had already
plumbed a lower depth of baseness
in his prurient eagerness for details.</p>

<p>August 29, 1828.&mdash;“I met Bachelor,
the poor Duke of York’s old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
servant, and now the king’s <i lang="fr">valet de
chambre</i>, and he told me some curious
things about the interior of the
palace. But he is coming to call
on me, and I will write down what
he tells me then.” On the 16th of
September he sent for Bachelor,
and had a long conversation with
him, drawing out all he could from
the valet about his master’s habits.</p>

<p>May 13, 1829.&mdash;“Bachelor called
again, telling me all sorts of details
concerning Windsor and St.
James.”</p>

<p>What a picture for the author of
Gil Blas! It reminds one of some
of those Spanish interiors the novelist
has so deftly painted, where
valet and adventurer put their
heads together, scheming how best
to open some rich don’s purse-strings,
or ensnare his confidence
before beginning some villanous
game at his expense. If these be
the springs of history, Clio defend
us against her modern sister!</p>

<p>What makes all this prying the
more indefensible is that Mr. Greville
was without need of it even for
the composition of these <cite>Memoirs</cite>.
Elsewhere he boasts of the “great
men” he has known. And it is
true that he knew them; and had
his ability equalled his opportunity,
enough sources of information were
honorably open to him to have
made his journal valuable and interesting.
But the truth is, Mr.
Greville loved to dabble in dirty
waters, as he has elsewhere plainly
shown in his book.</p>

<p>A large part of these volumes&mdash;the
major part of them, indeed&mdash;is
taken up with political gossip.
It would not be correct to give it
any higher title. Its weight as a
contribution to history, to use La
Bruyère’s illustration, would be
about two ounces. It consists
chiefly of what he gathered at the
council-table. But disloyal as this
tampering with his oath may have
been, his singular inaptitude to
gather what was really important
hardly offers even the poor excuse
of interesting his readers in its results.
The consideration of the
eccentricities and sarcasms of his
<i lang="fr">bête noir</i>, the chancellor (Lord
Brougham), during a large portion
of the time covered by this journal,
generally puts to flight in Mr.
Greville’s mind all other topics.
The rest of his political reminiscences
are made up of conversations
with the actors in the parliamentary
scenes here presented; but
even these lose the greater part of
their value from his inveterate habit
of confounding his own opinions
and language with those of the person
he happens to be “interviewing.”
This confusion in Mr. Greville’s
mind between what he
thought and said and what others
thought and said has been fully
exposed by the numerous letters
which have been drawn forth in
England from the survivors of the
persons named in his <cite>Memoirs</cite> or
from their friends. Mr. Greville
adds very little to our knowledge
of the events of the period he treats
of. Nearly everything of importance
in his journal has been anticipated.
The correspondence of
William IV. and Lord Grey, the
life and despatches of Wellington,
and the lives of Denman, Palmerston,
and others, have left little to
be supplied of this era of English
history.</p>

<p>One of the most curious features&mdash;we
might almost say the distinguishing
feature&mdash;in a work full of curious
traits of levity, conceit, and immature
judgment, is the universal tone
of depreciation in which the author
speaks of the men of his acquaintance.
This is not confined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
ordinary personages who lived and
died obscure, but embraces, as we
have heretofore said, a large number
of the names most illustrious
in statesmanship and diplomacy
in his times. Lord Althorpe, Melbourne,
the late Earl Derby, Graham,
Palmerston, O’Connell, Guizot,
Thiers&mdash;one scarcely picks out
a single name of eminence that
he has not attempted to belittle.
His opinions and prophecies
have been in every instance flatly
contradicted by events. Of Palmerston
especially&mdash;of his stupidity,
his ignorance, his lightness, his
general want of capacity, and the
certainty that he would never rise
to be anybody&mdash;he is never done
speaking slightingly. It is true
that the late English premier passed
through many years of obscurity
in office, making, perhaps, some sort
of excuse for Mr. Greville’s blindness;
but this example is not an
isolated one. The late Lord Derby
comes in for an almost equal share
of it, although he is allowed the
possession of some brains&mdash;a claim
denied to his after-rival. Mr. Greville
is equally impartial in discoursing
about crowned heads and
plain republicans. His neat and
finely-pointed satire stigmatized
the king whose paid servant he was
as a “blackguard,” a “dog,” and a
“buffoon”; and he held his nose,
as in the case of Washington Irving,
did any “vulgar” American democrat
come “between the wind and
his nobility.”</p>

<p>Those of Mr. Greville’s subjects
who have virtues are imbeciles;
those who have talent are adventurers
or knaves. He appears to
have centred all the admiration
of which he was capable upon Lord
de Ros, a young nobleman absolutely
unknown outside a small English
circle. Mr. Greville seems, in fact,
to have been one of those men who
seek, and sometimes gain, a certain
reputation for sagacity by depreciating
everybody around them. Of
the late Lord Derby he says: “He
(Stanley) must be content with a subordinate
part, and act with whom he
may, he will never inspire real confidence
or conciliate real esteem.”
In another place, in summing up a
conversation with Peel, he accuses
him (Stanley), by direct implication,
of being “a liar and a coward,” although
he puts these ugly words in
another’s mouth. How far these
predictions and this estimate were
just history has already decided.
High and low all dance to the same
music in Mr. Greville’s journal.
On September 10, 1833, speaking
of a speech of William IV.&mdash;not very
wise, perhaps, but natural enough
under the circumstances&mdash;he says:
“If he (William IV.) was not such
an ass that nobody does anything
but laugh at what he says, this
would be important. Such as it is,
it is nothing.”</p>

<p>The circumstances that influenced
his pique are sometimes of the
most trivial character. Under date
September 3, 1833, he notes that
the king complained that no one
was present to administer the oath
to a new member of the Privy Council
whom Brougham had introduced.
“And what is unpleasant,” he
says, “the king desires a clerk of
the council to be present when
anything is going on.” <i lang="la">Inde iræ.</i>
A few days afterwards, in a notice
of the prorogation of Parliament,
he thus revenges himself for the
king’s implied censure:</p>

<p>“He (William IV.) was coolly received;
for there is no doubt there
never was a king less respected.
George IV., with all his occasional
popularity, could always revive the
external appearance of loyalty when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
he gave himself the trouble.” Thus
one master, who was a “dog,” is
made to do duty on occasion against
an other who was an “ass.” But
this is not all he has to say of the
same monarch. At page 520, vol. ii.,
summing up his character after his
death, he says:</p>

<p>“After his (William IV.’s) accession
he always continued to be
something of a blackguard and
something more of a buffoon. It is
but fair to his memory at the same
time to say that he was a good-natured,
kind-hearted, and well-meaning
man, and that he always acted an
honorable and straightforward, if not
always a sound and discreet, part.”</p>

<p>That this statement, that “never
was there a king less respected,”
was false, it needs hardly the popular
verdict about William IV. to
prove. Mr. Greville contradicts
himself on page 251 of the same volume,
where he notes the “strong expressions
of personal regard and
esteem” entertained for the king
by such competent witnesses as two
of his ministers, Wellington and
Lord Grey. Even their testimony
is not needed. Whatever may have
been William IV.’s private weakness
and foibles, the regret felt for
him was general, and the esteem
for his character as a popular
sovereign publicly expressed. In
any case, the indecency in Mr.
Greville’s mouth of the expressions
he makes use of is too plain to
need argument. Speaking, in one
place, of Lord Brougham and referring
to the chancellor’s habit of
sarcasm, he says:</p>

<p>“He reminds me of the man in
<cite>Jonathan Wild</cite> who couldn’t keep
his hand out of his neighbor’s pocket,
although there was nothing in
it, nor refrain from cheating at
cards, although there were no stakes
on the table.”</p>

<p>This description is true enough,
in another sense, of Mr. Greville
himself. A Sir Fretful Plagiary, he
could see no man succeed without
carping at him, nor resist criticising
another’s performance for the sole
reason that he had no hand in it.
Noting the appearance of a political
letter by Lord Redesdale, he
says: “There is very little in it.”
This single phrase gives the key to
his character and the tone of his
journal. At page 69, vol. ii., he
sums up the whole subject of Irish
national education in the profoundly-disgusted
remark that there is
nothing more in it than “whether
the brats at school shall read the
whole Bible or only parts of it.”</p>

<p>Page 105, vol. ii.: “O’Connell is
supposed to be horribly afraid of the
cholera.” “He dodges between London
and Dublin” to avoid it, “shuns
the House of Commons,” and neglects
his duties. On pages 414-15:
“He (O’Connell) is an object of execration
to all those who cherish the
principles and feelings of honor”&mdash;a
high-toned remark, coming from
a man of such delicate honor that,
according to his own confession, he
had no scruple in greasing the palm
of a king’s valet for the secrets
of his master’s bed-chamber; who
avows without a blush that he deliberately
led Lord Mount Charles,
and Lord Adolphus Fitzclarence
into confidences he there and then
meant to betray; who in these <cite>Memoirs</cite>
is continually invading the privacy
of homes in which he was a
guest; and who, finally, takes advantage
of his official position under
oath to disclose the conversations
of the Privy Council! Surely,
no juster piece of self-satire was
ever written!</p>

<p>“’Tis a man of universal knowledge,”
says La Bruyère. His familiarity
with constitutional law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
would lead him to unseat the bench.
Judges Park and Aldersen, famous
lawyers, known to all the courts,
are “nonsensical” in a decision
they come to about the sheriff’s
lists. Mr. Justice Park is “peevish
and foolish.”</p>

<p>His loose way of damaging private
character is not less remarkable.
To give a single instance: he
gives a <i lang="fr">bon mot</i> about a certain Mr.
Wakley, a parliamentary candidate
of the day, who was forced to bring
an action against an insurance company,
which resisted the claim on
the ground that the plaintiff was
concerned in the fire. No further
information is given&mdash;the verdict
of the jury or the judgment. But
Mr. Greville thus coolly concludes:</p>

<p>“I forget what was the result of
the trial; but that of the evidence
was a conviction of his instrumentality.”
A “conviction” by whom?
By Mr. Greville&mdash;who “forgets the
result of the trial”! There is nothing
to show that the friends or
family of this Mr. Wakley are not
still living to suffer from this unsupported
libel. “Jesters,” says a
French humorist, “are wretched
creatures; that has been said before.
But those who injure the
reputation or the fortunes of others
rather than lose a <i lang="fr">bon mot</i>, merit an
infamous punishment; this has not
been said, and I dare say it.”</p>

<p>His “blackguards” are not all
seated on a throne. His hatred
of the “mob” was greater, if possible,
than his envy of his superiors.
“Odi profanum vulgus et arceo”
is the head-line of all his pages.
Look at this entry, where the whole
character of the man breaks forth
irresistibly:</p>

<p>“Newmarket, October 1, 1831.&mdash;Came
here last night, to my great
joy, to get holidays, and leave reform
and politics and cholera for
racing and its amusements. Just
before I came away I met Lord
Wharncliffe, and asked him about
his interview with radical Jones.
This <em>blackguard</em> considers himself
a sort of chief of a faction, and one
of the heads of the <i lang="fr">sans-culottins</i> of
the present day.”</p>

<p>From radical Jones to Washington
Irving is but a step for Mr.
Greville’s nimble pen. The one is&mdash;what
he says; the other, essentially
“vulgar.” The same “vulgarity”
offends his delicate taste in Thiers,
Macaulay, and a score of others
“the latchet of whose shoes he was
unworthy to loose.” Is it to be wondered
at that the venerable pontiff
Pius VIII. (page 325, vol. i.) fails to
satisfy this fastidious critic? The
pope, however, escapes tolerably
well. As a matter of course, “there
is nothing in him”; but the distinguished
urbanity and refined wit of
the condescending Mr. Greville is
satisfied to pronounce him a good-natured
“twaddle.” These large airs
of superior wisdom and refinement,
this tone of pitying kindness, which
Mr. Greville adopts towards the
most illustrious men in Europe of
his day, remind us of nothing so
much as the majestic demeanor of
the <em>burgo</em>, or great lord of Lilliput,
who harangued Capt. Gulliver the
morning after his arrival in that
island. “He seemed to me,” says
Capt. Gulliver, “to be somewhat
longer than my middle finger. He
acted every part of an orator, and
I could observe many periods of
threatening, and others of promises,
pity, and kindness.”</p>

<p>The distinguished author of these
<cite>Memoirs</cite> was not always, however,
as we have seen, in the same amiable
mood that the <em>burgo</em> afterwards
manifested. After lashing each one
of the persons he has known, separately
and in turn, in the words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
which we have quoted, in another
passage his acquaintances are all
collected in a group and dashed
off with graphic effect.</p>

<p>October 12, 1832.&mdash;Immediately
after an entry giving a conversation
with the accomplished Lady Cowper,
he says: “My journal is getting
intolerably stupid and entirely
barren of events. I would take to
miscellaneous and private matters,
if any fell in my way. But what
can I make out of such animals as
I herd with and such occupations
as I am engaged in?” A week after,
at Easton, besides Lady Cowper,
he names some other “animals”:
“The Duke of Rutland, the Walewskis,
Lord Burghersh and Hope&mdash;the
usual party,” he exclaims with
a sigh. Sad fate! The adventurous
Capt. Gulliver elsewhere, in a
letter to his cousin Sympson, says:
“Pray bring to your mind how often
I desired you to consider, when
you insisted on the motive of Public
Good, that the Yahoos were a
species of animals utterly incapable
of amendment by precept or example.”</p>

<p>Such appear to have been the
melancholy reflections forced upon
the mind of Mr. <em>Houyhnhnm</em>
Greville by the <em>Yahoos</em> he tells us
he was compelled to “herd with”!
Ever and anon he turns a regretful
eye to the nobler race he was suited
to, and lets us into the secret of
the company and occupations that
relieved him from the desolating
<i lang="fr">ennui</i> of uncongenial society.</p>

<p>“June 11, 1833.&mdash;At a place called
Buckhurst all last week for the Ascot
races. A party at Lentifield’s;
racing all the morning; then eating,
drinking, and play at night. I may
say with more truth than anybody,
<i lang="la">Video meliora proboque, deteriora
sequor</i>.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” it might have been
answered. “A jockey and gamester
<i lang="la">ab ovo usque ad mala</i>. Fortune
has now placed thee in the
rank kind nature fitted thee to
adorn, had not a too avid uncle
snatched thee therefrom, and dry
mountains of crackling parchment
and red tape crushed thy yearning
ardor for the loose boxes and the
paddock!”</p>

<p>“March 27.&mdash;Jockeys, trainers,
and blacklegs are my companions,
and it is like dram-drinking: having
once entered upon it, I cannot
leave it, although I am disgusted
with the occupation all the time.”
Truly a long and fond “disgust,”
since it lasted from his eighteenth
year until his death!</p>

<p>“While the fever it excites is raging
and the odds are varying, I can
neither read nor write nor occupy
myself with anything.”</p>

<p>Let us not be unjust to Mr. Greville.
Kings, pontiffs, statesmen,
and authors may have been “blackguards”
or “vulgar buffoons,” the
most refined society of both sexes
in England a “herd” of <em>Yahoos</em>;
but that he was not insensible to
real merit, that he had a true appreciation
of the good and the
beautiful when he found it, one
single example, shining out in these
many pages of depreciation, proves
beyond peradventure. In the flood
of universal cynicism that pours
over them, one man there is at
least who lifts his head above the
waters&mdash;one other gentle Houyhnhnm,
fit companion for Mr. Greville,
possessing all that wisdom and discretion
denied to the rest of the
world, and, more wonderful still,
that elegant taste the fastidious
critic finds nowhere else. This
phenomenon is Mr. John Gully,
prize-fighter retired! “Strong
sense,” “discretion,” “reserve and
good taste”&mdash;these are the encomiums<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
heaped upon him; to crown
all, “remarkably dignified and graceful
in his manners and actions.”
Ah! poor Macaulay, or thou, gentle
Diedrich Knickerbocker, where
wanders now thy ghost, condemned
for thy “vulgarity” to pace the
borders of the sluggish Styx,
while the “champion heavy-weight”
is ferried over to immortality
by this new Charon of gentility?</p>

<p>We decline to soil our pages
with any of Mr. Greville’s impure
stories. Those who have seized
on the book for the purpose of
reading them must have been sadly
disappointed if they hoped to find
in them a doubtful amusement. Not
a scintilla of wit relieves their baseness.
Their vileness is equalled
only by their dulness. They are
simply falsehoods from beginning
to end. Where Mr. Greville, with a
singular depravity, does not himself
admit them to be false while wilfully
publishing them, they have been
elsewhere fully and indignantly disproved.
In a single word, as Mrs.
Charles Kean aptly says in her letter
published in the <cite>Times</cite>, “the
grossness was in Mr. Greville’s
mind,” not in the conduct of those
he slanders.</p>

<p>If it be said that our criticism
upon these volumes and their author
has been too unsparing; that
the old saying, <i lang="la">De mortuis nil nisi bonum</i>,
should have inspired a smoother
tone, the answer is given by Mr.
Greville himself. “Memoirs of
this kind,” he said in a conversation
held some time before his
death with his editor, Mr. Reeve,
“ought not to be locked up till
they had lost their principal interest
by the death of all those who
had taken any part in the events
they describe.” In other words, the
diseased vanity and cynicism which
made him rail at everybody while
he lived made him unwilling to
lose the pleasure by anticipation
of wounding everybody after his
death. The shallow eagerness to
have himself talked about after he
was gone made him insensible to
those ideas which seem to have animated
Saint-Simon, who was content
to look forward to an indefinite
time for the publication of his
<cite>Memoirs</cite>, desiring them rather to
be a truthful and interesting contribution
to history than a hasty
means of venting his passing
spleen. Mr. Greville has indeed
been talked about sufficiently; but
that the conversation would be
pleasing to him, could he hear it, is
more doubtful.</p>

<p>One thing at least is to be commended
in Mr. Greville&mdash;his style.
This, for certain uses, is admirable.
It is easy and plain. He is a master
of that part of the art of writing
which Horace describes in the
10th <cite>Satire</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Interdum urbani, parcentis viribus atque</div>
<div class="verse">Extenuantis eas consulto.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His is “the language of the well-bred
man,” the pure English of the
society in which he lived. We do
not take account here of his occasional
coarseness, and even oaths&mdash;these
were of the character of the
man, not of his style. The latter,
for purposes of correspondence, or
even a short diary, might generally
be taken for a model. Any single
page will be read with pleasure.
But as, on the other hand, he neglects
the other side of the Venusian’s
advice, seldom rising to “support
the part of the poet or rhetorician,”
these closely-printed volumes eventually
become tiresome to the reader.
Even good English will grow
monotonous if it has nothing else
to sustain it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>Little room is left to speak of the
greatest of French memoir-writers,
or perhaps of any literature&mdash;Saint-Simon.
A few remarks may be jotted
down, having reference chiefly
to the points of contrast suggested
by the Greville <cite>Memoirs</cite>. Of the
substance and texture of Saint-Simon’s
great and voluminous work,
as it unrolls itself slowly before us&mdash;the
opening splendor, the daring,
the eccentricities, the wit, and the
vices of the courts under which he
lived; the prodigies of baseness
and monuments of heroic virtue that
rear themselves opposed in that marvellous
age; the long line of portraits,
dark, lurid, threatening, radiant,
gentle, so full of surprises to the
student of history as ordinarily written;
the turning of the fate of campaigns
by the caprice of an angry
woman; the crippling of fleets by
the jealousy of a minister; the desolation
of whole provinces by the
corruption of intendants; the closing
scenes of profligacy and bankruptcy
under the regency&mdash;many
pages would be required to give
even an outline. The analysis of
his genius and character would
make a distinct essay. Sainte-Beuve
and other masters of criticism
have labored in the field; yet
the soil is so rich that humbler
students will still find enough to
repay them. We indicate the landmarks
of the country, without entering
on it. Nor would we be
supposed to endorse or give our
sanction to many of the opinions
and sentiments Saint-Simon so
freely gives utterance to. His Gallicanism,
which he shared with the
court; his sympathy with the Jansenist
leaders, if not with their
heresy; his violent hatred of the
Jesuits&mdash;these are blots on his work
that cover many pages.</p>

<p>The Duc de Saint-Simon was
born in 1675. During the lifetime
of his father he bore the name of
the Vidame de Chartres, and in a
subsequent passage of his <cite>Memoirs</cite>,
relating to the birth of his own eldest
son, he gives a highly characteristic
account of the title. At his first
appearance at court the king was
already privately married to Mme.
de Maintenon, the widow Scarron,
whose character and astonishing
fortunes are nowhere more vividly
described than in the pages of Saint-Simon.
Louis XIV. was at the
summit of his glory. Henceforward,
though none could then foresee
it, the course was all down-hill.
Saint-Simon in his first campaigns
accompanied the king into Flanders.
Some discontent about promotion,
to which he believed himself entitled,
caused him to retire from the
service. Henceforward he continued
to live chiefly at court, having
already begun the composition of
his <cite>Memoirs</cite>. On the death of his
father, the confidential adviser of
Louis XIII., even under the ministry
of the famous Cardinal Richelieu,
he succeeded to the title and
the government of Blaye. At this
early age he was accustomed secretly
to visit the monastery of La
Trappe for meditation and retreat.
His gravity and seriousness of mind
are everywhere felt through his
<cite>Memoirs</cite>, although these qualities
do not lessen the pungency of his
style, nor blunt the <i lang="fr">bon mots</i> of the
court, or his graphic description of
the surprising adventures of the
men of his day. He married Mlle.
de Durfort, the daughter of Marshal
de Durfort. This union was one
of singular happiness, interrupted
only by her death.</p>

<p>The death of the Dauphin, the
pupil of Fénelon, destroyed the
hopes that were opening up before
Saint-Simon of becoming the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
minister of the next reign. Under
the regency he continued to be the
intimate and sometimes confidential
adviser of the Duke of Orleans, although
supplanted in state affairs by
Cardinal Dubois. His embassy to
Madrid to negotiate the marriage
of the young king, Louis XV., with
the Infanta of Spain, is well known.
After the death of the regent he
retired to his château of La Ferté-Vidame,
where chiefly he continued
henceforward to live in retirement,
composing his immortal
<cite>Memoirs</cite>. He died in Paris in 1755.
Having known the subtle sway of a
Maintenon, he lived to see the audacious
empire of the Pompadour; and
having served in his first campaigns
under Luxembourg, he witnessed
before his death the Great Frederick
launch his thunderbolts of war,
and the rise of Prussia among the
great powers of Europe.</p>

<p>To attempt, in these few concluding
remarks, to give any criticism
of Saint-Simon’s great work would
be a hopeless task. Its character is
so many-sided, even contradictory,
that any single judgment about it
would be deceptive. We were impelled
to connect the author’s name
with that of the later memoir-writer
by the contrasts which irresistibly
suggested themselves.</p>

<p>Stated broadly, the main distinction
between Saint-Simon and such
writers as Greville and his kind is
this: that Saint-Simon presents a
connected narrative, flowing on
largely, fully, evenly, abundantly,
like a majestic river sweeping slowly
past many varieties of scenery;
while Greville gives nothing more
than a hodge-podge diary, with no
connection except the illusory one
of dates, a jumble of short stories,
petty details, and ill-natured remarks,
bubbling like a noisy brook
over stones and shingle, often half
lost in the mud and sand, and not
unlikely to end in a common sewer.
It follows that, while it is difficult
to remember particular events or
conversations in Greville’s journal,
many scenes from Saint-Simon remain
for ever fixed in the memory.
Take, for instance, one&mdash;not the
most striking&mdash;that of the death of
Monseigneur. Who can forget the
picture of the old king, in tears,
only half-dressed, hastening to the
bedside of his son; the sudden
terror of the prince’s household;
the flight of La Choin, hastily gathering
up her jewelry; the row of
officers on their knees in the long
avenue, crying out to the king to
save them from dying of hunger;
the well-managed eyes of the courtiers
at Marly!</p>

<p>Greville is cynical or satirical by
dint of the child’s art of using hard
words. Saint-Simon seldom, comparatively
speaking, puts on the
garb of a cynic; but his narrative,
with scarcely any obtrusion of the
writer, often becomes a satire as
terrible as that of some passages of
Tacitus, or, in another vein, of
Juvenal.</p>

<p>Many of the historical characters
introduced into these works are no
favorites of ours; but our purpose
in this article has been, not to discuss
them, but rather the capacity
and good taste, or otherwise, of
their critics.</p>

<p>Sainte-Beuve, in one of his felicitous
periods, expresses the wish
that every age might have a Saint-Simon
to chronicle it. As a paraphrase
of this remark, it might be
said that it is to be wished no other
age may have a Greville to slander
it.</p>

<h3>DOM GUÉRANGER AND SOLESMES.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p>The church in France has just
sustained a severe loss in the death
of Dom Guéranger, the illustrious
Abbot of Solesmes, who, on the 30th
of January last, rendered up his
soul to God in the noble abbey
which he had restored at the same
time that he brought back the Benedictine
Order to France; and where,
during the last forty years of his
life, he had lived in the practice of
every monastic virtue, and in the
pursuit of literary labors which have
rendered him one of the oracles of
ecclesiastical learning.</p>

<p>We are not about to enter into
details of the religious life of the
venerable abbot. It belongs rather
to those who have been its daily
witnesses to trace its history; but
we feel that it may be of interest to
touch upon certain features of the
character and public works of this
humble and patient religious, this
vigorous athlete, the loss of whom
is so keenly felt by the Holy Father,
whose friend and counsellor he was,
and by the church, of which he was
the honor and the unwearied defender.</p>

<p>Dom Guéranger, in mental temperament,
belonged to that valiant
generation of Catholics who, after
1830, energetically undertook the
cause of religion in their unhappy
country, more than ever exposed to
the attacks of the Revolution. The
university had become a source of
antichristian teaching; the press
everywhere overflowed with evil and
daring scandals of every kind were
rife. A new generation of Jacobins
had sprung from the old stock, and
were eager to invade everything noble,
venerable, and sacred; legal tyranny
threatened to do away with
well-nigh all liberty of conscience,
while the government, either not daring
or not desiring to sever itself
from the ambitious conspirators to
whom it owed its being, allowed free
course to the outrages and persecutions
against the church. It was
the most critical and ominous period
of the century, and French society
was rapidly sinking into an
abyss.</p>

<p>One man, who had foreseen all
this evil, and whose genius would
have probably sufficed victoriously
to combat it, had he only possessed
the virtue of humility, was M. de
Lamennais. Happily, the pleiades
of chosen minds whom he had gathered
around him did not lose courage
after the melancholy defection
of their brilliant master. The three
most illustrious of these shared
among them the defence of the
faith against the floods of unbelief
that threatened to overwhelm the
country. Montalembert remained
to defend the church in the public
assemblies; Lacordaire adopted as
his own the words of S. Paul to his
disciple, <i lang="la">Prædica verbum, insta opportune,
importune</i>,<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and succeeded
so effectually that he brought
back the robe of S. Dominic into
the pulpit of Notre Dame, amid the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
applause of the conquered multitude;
Guéranger felt that prayer
and sound learning were the two
great wants of society. The number
of priests was insufficient for
the labors of the sacred ministry.
The needs of the time had indeed
called forth some few weighty as
well as brilliant apologists; but deep
and solid learning as yet remained
buried in the past, and the patient
study so necessary for the polemics
of the present and the future threatened
indefinitely to languish. It
was to this point, therefore, that the
Abbé Guéranger directed his especial
attention, and he it was who
was chosen of God to rekindle the
expiring, if not extinguished, flame.</p>

<p>He was led to this sooner than he
himself had perhaps anticipated,
and by a circumstance which rather
appeared likely to have disturbed
his projects. Solesmes, which, up
to the Revolution, had been a priory
dependent on S. Vincent de
Mans, had just been sold to one of
those “infernal bands” who in the
course of a few years destroyed the
greatest glories of France. Everything
was to be pulled down: the
cloister of eight centuries and the
church, renowned for the admirable
sculptures now doomed to fall beneath
the “axe and hammer”; the
authorities of the time doing nothing
to check the devastation effected
by the bandits who were rifling
their country after having assassinated
her.</p>

<p>The Abbé Guéranger could not
endure to witness the annihilation
of so much that was sacred and venerable;
besides, the ruins of Solesmes
were especially dear to him,
and had been the favorite haunt of
his early childhood and youth, so
much so that from this and other
characteristic circumstances he was
at that period known among his
school comrades at Le Sablé as <cite>The
Monk</cite>. In concert with Dom Fontaine
and other ecclesiastics of the
neighborhood he rescued the abbey
from the hands of its intending destroyers.
It had already suffered
considerably from the Revolution,
but remained intact in all essential
particulars. He spent the winter
of 1833 at Paris, going about
the city in his monk’s habit&mdash;which
at that time had become a novelty&mdash;and
knocking at every door, without
troubling himself about the religious
opinions or belief of those
to whom he addressed himself.
The sceptical citizens of the time
amused themselves not a little at
his expense; but the learned world
received with distinction the energetic
young priest who was so bent
upon giving back the Benedictine
Order to France. He never once
allowed any obstacles to hinder or
discourage him in the prosecution
of his undertaking. In 1836 he repaired
to Rome, there to make his
novitiate; and, after a year passed
in the Benedictine Abbey of San
Paolo Fuora Muri, he pronounced
his solemn vows, and occupied himself
in preparing the constitutions
of Solesmes. These, on the 1st of
September, 1837, were approved by
Pope Gregory XVI., who at the
same time raised the Priory of Solesmes
into an abbey, and authoritatively
nominated Dom Guéranger
to be its first abbot.</p>

<p>Solesmes and the grand Order
of S. Benedict were thus restored
to France. The new abbot was
soon surrounded by men nearly all
of whom have taken a distinguished
rank in learning and science, and
during forty years the austere discipline
and deep and extensive studies
of the sons of S. Benedict flourished
under his able rule.</p>

<p>Dom Guéranger, moreover, restored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
Ligugé, the oldest monastery
in France, built in 360 by S. Martin
of Tours. He also founded the
Priory of S. Madeleine at Marseilles,
and at Solesmes the Abbey of Benedictine
Nuns of S. Cecilia.</p>

<p>The attention he bestowed upon
these important foundations did
not hinder this indefatigable religious
from amassing the treasures of
erudition which he dispensed with
so much ability in defence of the
truth and of sound doctrine. To
the end of his life his pen was active
either in writing the numerous
works which have rendered his
name so well known, or in correcting
the errors of polemics and answering
his adversaries when the
interests of religion required it;
habitually going straight to the
point in his replies, fearlessly attacking
whatever was false or mistaken,
and never allowing any approach to
a compromise with error. The defence
of the church was his constant
and engrossing thought, and
no important controversy arose but
he was sure to appear with the accuracy
of his learning and the always
serious but unsparing process
of a logic supported by a thorough
acquaintance with doctrine and
facts.</p>

<p>The Abbot of Solesmes was endowed
with a large amount of prudence
and good sense. When his
former companions of La Chesnaie
undertook to popularize “liberal
Catholicism,” the precise creed of
which has never yet been ascertained,
and the unfailing results of
which have been scandal and division,
he undertook to bring back
the church in France to unity of
prayer by writing his book entitled
<cite>Institutions Liturgiques</cite>, which,
exhibiting in all their beauty the
forgotten rites and symbols, succeeded
in securing for them the
appreciation they merit; so that
from that time the liturgy in France
began to disengage itself from the
multiplicity of particular observances.</p>

<p>In this matter Dom Guéranger
had engaged in no trifling combat,
his opponents being many and
powerful; but he energetically defended
his ground, and did not die
until he had seen his undertaking
crowned with full success by the
restoration of the Roman liturgy
in France.</p>

<p>Besides these liturgical labors,
which chiefly occupied him, and his
<cite>Letters</cite> to the Archbishops of Rheims
and Toulouse, as likewise to Mgr.
Fayet, Bishop of Orleans, in defence
of the <cite>Institutions</cite>, he undertook
the <cite>Liturgical Year</cite>, which, unfortunately,
was left unfinished at his
death. His <cite>Mémoire</cite> upon the Immaculate
Conception was included
among those memorials sent to the
bishops by the Sovereign Pontiff
on the promulgation of the dogma.
His <cite>Sainte Cécile</cite>, remarkable for its
historical accuracy, as well as for its
excellence as a literary composition,
is a finished picture of Christian
manners during the earliest
centuries.</p>

<p>When the Vatican Council was
sitting, Dom Guéranger appeared
for the last time in the breach. Confined
a prisoner by sickness, but
intrepid as those old captains who
insist on being borne into the midst
of the fight, he wished to take part
in the great debate which was being
carried on in the church. He
fought valiantly, and answered the
adversaries of tradition by his
work on <cite>The Pontifical Monarchy</cite>,
defending Pope Honorius against
the attacks of an ill-informed academician.</p>

<p>We are unable to give a complete
list of the writings of Dom Guéranger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
numerous articles having
been published by him in the
<cite>Univers</cite>&mdash;notably those on Maria
d’Agreda and the reply to an exaggerated
idea of M. d’Haussonville
on the attitude of the church
under the persecution of the First
Bonaparte. We will only name, in
concluding this part of the subject,
his <cite>Essais sur le Naturalisme</cite>, which
dealt a heavy blow to free-thinking;
his <cite>Réponses</cite> upon the liturgical
law to M. l’Abbé David, now
Bishop of St. Brieuc; and a <cite>Défense
des Jesuites</cite>.</p>

<p>Should it be asked how the Abbot
of Solesmes could find the time for
so many considerable works, the
answer is given in the <cite>Imitation</cite>:
<i lang="la">Cella continuata dulcescit</i>. He had
made retreat a willing necessity for
himself, and, being in the habit of
doing everything in its proper time,
he had time for everything without
need of haste.</p>

<p>From the day that he became
Abbot of Solesmes he was scarcely
ever seen in the world, never absenting
himself without absolute
necessity or from obedience. Of
middle height, decided manner,
with a quick eye and serious smile,
Dom Guéranger attracted those
who came to him by the simplicity
and kindness of his reception, and
those who sought his advice by the
discerning wisdom of his counsels.
High ecclesiastical dignities might
have been his had he not preferred
to remain in the seclusion of his beloved
abbey.</p>

<p>He leaves behind him something
far better than even his books, in
bequeathing to the church and to
society a family of monks strongly
imbued with his spirit, and destined
to perpetuate the holy traditions
which he was the first to revive in
his native land.</p>

<p>The imposing ceremonies of the
funeral of Dom Guéranger, which
took place on the 4th of February
at the Abbey of Solesmes, were conducted
by the Bishops of Mans,
Nantes, and Quimper; there were
also present the Abbots of Ligugé,
La Trappe de Mortagne, Aiguebelle,
and Pierre-qui-Vire, besides more
than two hundred priests of La
Sarthe.</p>

<p>The remains of the reverend father,
clothed in pontifical vestments,
with the mitre and crozier, were
exposed in the church from the
evening of the 30th (Saturday) for
the visits of the faithful, crowds of
whom came from all the country
round, in spite of the exceeding
inclemency of the weather, to pay
their last respects and to be present
at the funeral of the illustrious
man, who, during his forty years’
residence among them, had made
himself so greatly beloved. Just
before the close of the ceremony,
when the Bishop of Mans invited
those present to look for the last
time upon the holy and beautiful
countenance of the departed abbot,
who had been a father to many
outside as well as within the cloister
walls, a general and irrepressible
burst of sobs and tears arose
from the multitude which thronged
the church.</p>

<p>Among those present were many
noble and learned friends of the
deceased, besides the mayor and
municipal council of Solesmes, and
also of Sablé (Dom Guéranger’s
native place), a deputation of the
marble-workers of the district, and
people of every class.</p>

<p>Before concluding our notice we
must devote a page or two to the
“Old Cloister Tower,” which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
discernible from a considerable distance,
with its four or five stories
and its heraldic crown rising
above the walls of the ancient borough
of Solesmes. The abbey
itself next appears in sight, majestically
seated on the slope of a wide
valley, through which flows the
Sarthe, on a level with its grassy
borders.</p>

<p>The locality, which is pleasing
rather than picturesque, is fertile,
animated, and cheerful. Besides
several châteaux of recent construction,
which face the abbey
from the opposite side of the river,
may be seen, at some distance off,
the splendid convent of Benedictine
Nuns, built some years ago by
a lady of Marseilles, and on the
horizon appears the Château of Sablé,
with its vast terraces and (according
to the country-people) its
three hundred and sixty-five windows.</p>

<p>The Abbey of Solesmes, founded
about the year 1025, has preserved,
in spite of several reconstructions,
the architectural arrangement, so
suitable for community life, copied
by its first monks from the Roman
houses of the order. The enclosure
consists of a quadrangle, with
an almost interminable cloister, out
of which are entrances into the
church, the chapter-house, the refectory,
the guest-chamber, and all
the places of daily assembly.
There silence and recollection
reign supreme. Excepting only
during the times of recreation, no
sound is to be heard save the twittering
of birds, the sound of the
<cite>Angelus</cite> or some other occasional
bell, or the subdued voice of a
monk who, with some visitor, is
standing before a sculptured saint,
or examining the fragments of some
ancient tomb.</p>

<p>It is chiefly the abbey church
which attracts the curiosity and
interest of artists and antiquaries.
There is not an archæologist who
has not heard of the “Saints of
Solesmes,” as the groups of statues
and symbolic sculptures are called
which fill the chapels of the transept
from roof to pavement. These
wonderful works, executed for the
most part under the direction of
the priors of Solesmes, form one of
the finest monuments of mediæval
sculpture to be found in France.
They are mystic and somewhat
mannered in style, but of bold conception,
vigorously expressed.</p>

<p>A multitude of personages, sacred,
historical, or allegorical, intermingle
with coats-of-arms, heraldic
devices, bandrols, and all the
details of an ornamentation of
which the skilfully-studied arrangement
corrects the redundance,
which would otherwise be confused.
This, however, is but the purely
decorative portion; the principal
works being enshrined in deep
niches or recesses, in which may
be seen groups of seven or eight
figures, the size of life, and wonderfully
effective in attitude and
action.</p>

<p>In a low-vaulted crypt resting on
pillars, to the right, is represented
the Entombment. This group,
which is the earliest in date, having
been executed in 1496 under the
direction of Michel Colomb, “habitant
de Tours et tailleur d’ymaiges
du roy,” is the most considerable,
and perhaps also the most striking.
All the figures, ten in number, have
impressed on their countenances
and movements the feeling of the
dolorous function in which they
are engaged. Most of them are
represented in the costume, and
probably with the features, of persons
of the time. Joseph of Arimathea
in particular has the look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
and bearing of the lord of the place,
or, it may be, of the prior of the
monastery. But nothing attracts
the attention more than a little
statue with features so refined that
it might have descended from the
canvas of Carlo Dolci. It is the
Magdalen, seated in the dust; the
elbows supported on the knees,
the hands joined, the eyes closed.
All her life seems concentrated in
her soul; and that is absorbed in
penitence and prayer, grief, love,
and resignation&mdash;she is as if still
shedding her sanctified odors at
the Saviour’s feet.</p>

<p>The left transept is devoted to
the honor of the Blessed Virgin.
She has fallen asleep in the Lord,
surrounded by the apostles. Then
follow her burial, her Assumption,
and finally her glorification. She
tramples under foot the dragon,
who, with bristling horns and claws,
vainly endeavors to reach her. He
is bound for a thousand years.
This subject, rarely attempted, is
here powerfully treated; all these
heads, with horrible grimaces, appear
to be howling and blaspheming
in impotent fury&mdash;<i lang="la">Et iratus est
draco in mulierem</i><a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>&mdash;but the Woman
is raised on high, and with
her virginal foot tramples on the enemy
of mankind. Facing this subject
are the patriarchs and prophets,
in niches royally decorated.
This work was executed in 1550 by
Floris d’Anvers, after the plan given
by Jean Bouglet, Doctor of the
Sorbonne, and Prior of Solesmes.</p>

<p>But time would fail us to describe
all these remarkable sculptures,
which so narrowly escaped destruction
or desecration at the hands of
the revolutionists. The First Napoleon
had the idea of transporting
them to some museum as curiosities
of art. It would have been a
sacrilege, and one which, alas! has
been too often perpetrated in other
countries besides France. But
what Catholic that visits the garden
even, to say nothing of the museum,
of the ancient monastery of Cluny
(now Musée de Cluny, at Paris), is
not pained at seeing saints and virgins,
angels and apostles, more or
less shattered and dismembered,
torn from their places in the sanctuary,
and figuring as statues on the
lawn, or mere groups of sculpture
picturesquely placed to assist the
effect of the gardener’s arrangement
of the shrubs and flower-beds?</p>

<p>Bonaparte, however (after testing
with gimlet and saw the hardness
of the stone), found himself obliged
to leave the “Saints of Solesmes”
where they were, as, unless the
whole were to be ruined, the entire
transept would have had to be transported
all in one piece, every part
of this immense sculptured fresco
being connected and, as it were, enwound
with the other portions, and
each detail having only its particular
excellence in the completeness
of the rest.</p>

<p>It is amid the ceremonies of Solesmes
that those who enter into
the spirit of Christian art can penetrate
more deeply into the meaning
of the vast poem carved upon the
walls of the church. During the
simple recital of the psalms, as in
the most solemn and magnificent
ceremonies, there is a striking harmony
between the decoration and
the action, the one being a commentary
on the other. The monks,
motionless in their carven stalls, or
disposed on the steps of the altar,
seem to make one with the Jerusalem
in stone, while the saints in
their niches may almost be imagined
to sing with the psalmody and
meditate during the solemn rites at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
which they are present. At the
most solemn moment of the Mass,
when clouds of incense are filling
the holy place, the mystic dove descends,
bearing between her silver
wings the Bread of Heaven, and,
when it is deposited in the pyx,
mounts again into her aerial shrine,
which is suspended from a lofty
cross.</p>

<p>This custom of elevating the tabernacle
between heaven and earth
was not the only one in which the
venerable abbot exactly copied the
ancient rites. The ceremonies of
Solesmes are full of the spirit of the
church’s liturgy, and the community
formed by his teaching and example
will not fail to perpetuate
the pious and venerable observances
which he was the first to restore
in France.</p>

<h3>LEGEND OF THE BLUMISALPE.</h3>

<p>There was a time when around
this mountain, now covered with
perpetual snow, swarms of bees produced
aromatic honey; fine cows,
pasturing the entire year in the
green fields, filled the dairy-women’s
pails with rich milk; and the
farmer by trifling labor obtained
abundant harvests. But the inhabitants
of this fertile country,
blinded by the splendor of their
fortune, became proud and haughty.
They were intoxicated with
the charms of wealth; they forgot
that there are duties attached to
the possession of wealth&mdash;the duties
of hospitality and of charity. Instead
of using their treasures judiciously,
they employed them solely
in ministering to a more luxurious
idleness, and in a continual succession
of festivities. They closed
their ears to the supplications of
the unfortunate, and sent the poor
from their doors; and God punished
them.</p>

<p>One of these proud, rich men
built on the verdant slopes of the
Blumisalpe a superb château, intending
to reside there, surrounded
by his unworthy associates. Every
morning their baths were filled
with the purest milk.</p>

<p>The terraced steps of the gardens
were made, according to the
legend, of finely-cut blocks of excellent
cheese. This Sardanapalus
of the mountains had inherited all
his father’s vast domains, and, whilst
he revelled in this manner in his
rich possessions, his old mother was
living in want in the seclusion of
the valley. One day the poor old
woman, suffering from cold and
hunger, supplicated his compassion.
She told him that she was living
alone in her cabin, unable to
work; indigent, without assistance;
infirm, without support. She begged
him to grant her the fragments
of his feast, a refuge in his stables;
but, deaf to her entreaties, he ordered
her to leave. She showed
him her cheeks, wrinkled by grief
more than by age; her emaciated
arms, that had carried him in his
infancy; he threatened to command
his attendants to drive her
away.</p>

<p>The poor woman returned to her
cabin, overwhelmed with grief by
this cruel outrage. She tottered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
through his beautiful grounds with
bowed head, and sighs that she
could not restrain burst from her
oppressed heart, and bitter tears
streamed from her eyes. God
counted the mother’s tears.</p>

<p>She had scarcely arrived at her
hut when the avenging storm came.</p>

<p>The château of the ignominious
son was struck by lightning, his
treasures were consumed by the
flames, from which he himself did
not escape, and his companions
perished with him.</p>

<p>Those fields, that once yielded
so abundantly, are now covered
with a mass of snow that never
melts. On the spot where his mother
vainly implored his compassion,
the rent earth has opened
a frightful abyss; and where her
tears then flowed now, drop by
drop, fall the tears of the eternal
glaciers.</p>

</div>

<p>These books have been prepared with
great care and rare tact. We have examined,
from time to time, the various
Readers which are used in this country,
and the Young Catholic’s Series is certainly
the best which we have seen. But the
Fifth and Sixth Readers of this series
are especially good, and we are confident
that they are destined to become the
standard Readers of the Catholic schools
of the United States. They are indeed
more than reading-books: they are collections
of choice specimens of English
literature, in prose and poetry, so arranged
as to present every variety of style,
that opportunity may be given to the pupil
to cultivate all the different forms of
vocal expression.</p>

<p>In the Fifth Reader the attention of the
young Catholic is called to the history of
the church in the United States by the
attractive biographical notices of some
of the most distinguished bishops and
archbishops of this country; and, as an
introduction to the Sixth, we have a brief
but exhaustive treatise on elocution.
We have not the space to enter into a
minute criticism of these books; but
we have expressed our honest conviction
of their excellence, and we are quite sure
that their own merits will open for them
a way into Catholic schools throughout
the land.</p>

that more than half the work of defence
is done by a simple explanation. During

show the wisdom that dictated it. The
translation I have given is the one authorized
by His Eminence the Cardinal

<p><span class="smcap">Personal Reminiscences.</span> By Moore
and Jerdan. Edited by Richard Henry
Stoddard. New York: Scribner, Armstrong
&amp; Company. 1875.</p>

</div>

<p>This small and dainty-looking little
volume is one of the “Bric-a-Brac” Series.
Its two hundred and eighty-eight pages
profess to give us the “personal reminiscences”
of Moore and Jerdan. They
give nothing more than such extracts
from the original as have taken the fancy
of the editor. Whether that fancy has always
been wise in its choice is fairly open
to question. There is much of Moore’s
reminiscences omitted that might have
been very profitably inserted, at least in
exchange for many things which have
found their way into the volume. It is
Moore “bottled off,” so to say, and given
out in small doses. The experiment is
not very satisfactory. Moore suffered
irretrievably in his biographer, Lord John
Russell, of whose “eight solid volumes,”
as Mr. Stoddard says, “the essence is
here presented to the reader.” Lord Russell
will be credited with many blunders
in after time, and very grave ones some
of them; but never did he make a more
exasperating mistake than in undertaking
the editing of Moore’s <cite>Memoirs, Journal,
and Correspondence</cite>, in rivalry of Moore’s
own admirable biography of Byron. Readers
of <cite>Personal Reminiscences</cite> must be prepared
to meet with a vast quantity of nonsense
and trash. But much of this constitutes
the chief value of such works. In
the jottings down of daily journals no one
expects to meet with profound reflections
and labored thoughts. They are rather,
in the hands of such men as Moore, “the
abstract and brief chronicle of the time”
in which they are made. Moore’s witty
and graceful pen was just adapted to such
work as this. Whoever or whatever was
considered worth seeing in the world in
which he lived and moved as one of its
chief ornaments, he saw, and set down in
his private journal. Bits of this Mr. Stoddard
gives us in the present volume; but
those who care for this kind of literature
at all will prefer the whole to such parts
as have pleased the editor; and the whole
does possess an intrinsic value to which
the present volume does not pretend.
Mr. Stoddard’s preface is not encouraging.
He seems to write under protest
that his valuable time should be consumed
in this kind of work. “I cannot
put myself in the place of a man who
keeps a journal in which he is the principal
figure, and in which his whereabouts,
and actions, and thoughts, and feelings
are detailed year after year,” says Mr.
Stoddard; and the obvious comment is:
“Very probably; but no one has asked
Mr. Stoddard to do anything so foolish.”
Persons who keep “journals,” however,
are not in the habit of keeping them for
other people. “I cannot put myself in
the place of Moore,” insists Mr. Stoddard,
with unnecessary pertinacity, “who
seems to have never lost interest in himself.”
The comment again is very obvious:
Mr. Stoddard is a very different
man from Mr. Moore. The truth is, Mr.
Stoddard does not like either Moore or
his poetry. “The reputation which had
once been his had waned.” “A new and
greater race of poets than the one to which
he belonged had risen.” “<cite>Lalla Rookh</cite>
was still read, <em>perhaps</em>, but not with the
same pleasure as <cite>The Princess</cite> or <cite>The
Blot on the Scutcheon</cite>. Moore had ‘ceased
to charm.’” Such statements as these Mr.
Stoddard would seem to consider self
evident facts of which no proof is needed.
And he would be astonished were some
one to ask him to point out the “new and
greater race of poets” which has arisen
since Moore’s death. Still more would
he be astonished if asked to point out, not
“a race of poets,” but a single member
of the race whose writings are more read,
whose name and fame are better known,
who is “greater,” than Moore. He would
be thunderstruck were he informed
that for a hundred who had read <cite>Lalla
Rookh</cite> not twenty had read <cite>The Princess</cite>,
knew its author or of its existence, and
not ten knew even of the name of the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
poem mentioned. Altogether, though Mr.
Stoddard’s preface is short, it is certainly
not sweet, and both himself and the reader
are to be congratulated at his not having
extended it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Our Lady’s Dowry</span>; or, How England
Gained and Lost that Title. A compilation
by the Rev. T. E. Bridgett, of the
Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer.
London: Burns &amp; Oates.
1875. (New York: Sold by The Catholic
Publication Society.)</p>

</div>

<p>This book is among the most delightful
and the most valuable which it has
been our good-fortune to meet with. It
establishes not only the fact of England
having been called “throughout Europe
Our Lady’s Dowry,” but her right to the
glorious title.</p>

<p>Those who imagine what is known to-day
as Catholic devotion to Our Lady a
thing of comparatively modern growth,
or, again, that it can only bloom luxuriantly
in the sunny climes of Spain and
Italy, will find both illusions dispelled in
these pages. The old Anglo-Saxon love
of Mary was as warm and tender as any
of which human hearts are capable. And
instead of finding our English ancestors
behind us in this devotion, we must
rather own ourselves behind them.</p>

<p>We would gladly give our readers an
analysis of Father Bridgett’s “compilation,”
but this cannot be done except in
an elaborate review. Suffice it to say that
never was a “compilation” (as the author
modestly calls it) less like what is ordinarily
understood by the term&mdash;we mean
in point of interest and style.</p>

<p>We subjoin a passage from Chapter V.
on “Beads and Bells” (p. 201). We
think the information it contains will be
new to almost all:</p>

<p>“The word ‘bead’ has undergone in
English a curious transformation of meaning.
It is the past participle of the Saxon
verb <i lang="ang">biddan</i>, to bid, to invite, to <em>pray</em>. Thus
in early English it is often used simply
for <em>prayers</em>, without any reference whatever
to their nature or the mode of reciting
them. To ‘bid the beads’ is merely
to say one’s prayers. ‘Bidding the
beads’ also meant a formal enumeration
of the objects of prayer or persons to be
prayed for. Beadsmen or beads-women
are not necessarily persons who say the
Rosary, but simply those who pray for
others, especially for their benefactors.</p>

<p>“But as a custom was introduced in
very early times of counting prayers said,
by the use of little grains or pebbles
strung together, the name of prayer got
attached to the instrument used for saying
prayers; and in this sense the word beads
is commonly used by Catholics at the
present day.</p>

<p>“Lastly, the idea of prayer was dropped
out altogether in Protestant times, and
the name of ‘beads’ was left attached to
any little perforated balls which could
be strung together merely for personal
adornment, without any reference to devotion.”</p>

Holy Scripture. It includes a history of
the patriarchs from the beginning to the
birth of Moses; of the Israelites from the
birth of Moses to the end of the Judges;
of the Kings from the establishment of
the kingdom to its end; and of the

<h3>SPECIMEN CHARITIES.</h3>

<p>Charity is generally acknowledged
to be, particularly by those
who do not practise it, the greatest
of the virtues. Judged by this
standard, everything connected with
it ought to command a special interest.
Among ourselves the most
practical form of it is exhibited in
the institutions provided for the
care of that large section of society
that may be classed as the unfortunate.
It is only natural to suppose,
then, that the reports of these institutions
would be caught up and
studied with avidity by the public,
who in some shape or form pay for
and support them. Nothing, however,
is further from the truth. It
is safe to say that not one man out
of every hundred ever sees a report
of any single institution, or ever
dreams even of the existence of
such a thing.</p>

<p>This indifference to how our
money goes is one of the chief causes
of the gross peculations and
frauds that startle and shock the
public mind from time to time.
Where scrutiny is not close and
constant, the conduct of those who
have reason to expect scrutiny is
apt to be proportionately loose and
careless. There is no intention in
saying this to arraign the managers
of public institutions with loose and
careless conduct in the discharge
of their duties and the dispensing
of the large sums of money confided
to their care. All that we would
say is that the public is too inert
in the matter. A sharp lookout on
officials of any kind never does
harm to any one. It will be courted
by honest men, while it hangs
like the sword of Damocles over
the heads of the dishonest. At all
events, it is the safest voucher for
activity, zeal, and honesty on all
sides.</p>

<p>The reports of several of the institutions
best known to the public
in this city have been examined,
and the result of the investigation
will be set forth in this article. It
may be said here that perhaps a
chief reason for the general apathy
of the public regarding these reports
is due to the reports themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
As a rule, they seem to be drawn up
with the express purpose of giving
the least possible information in the
most roundabout fashion. The very
sight of them warns an inquirer off.
While he is solely intent on finding
out what such and such an institution
does for its inmates, what it
has done, what it purposes doing,
how it is conducted, what it costs,
what it produces, what success it
can point to in plain black and
white, and not in general terms, he
is almost invariably treated to homilies
on charity; to dissertations on
the growing number of the poor and
the awfulness of crime; to tirades on
the public-school question; to highly-colored
opinions on the duty of
enforcing education; to extracts from
letters that, for all he can determine,
date from nowhere and are signed
by no one. Such is a fair description
of the average “report” of any
given charity or public institution,
as any conscientious reader who is
anxious for a sleepless night and
morning headache may convince
himself by glancing at the first half-dozen
that come in his way.</p>

<p>This is much to be regretted.
Little more than a year ago public
inquiry was stimulated by the public
press to examine into the record
of the institutions that for years and
years have been absorbing vast sums
of money, with no very apparent result.
Grave charges were then
made and substantiated by very ugly
figures, showing that the cost of
the majority of institutions was enormously
in excess of the good effected.
It was charged that the
statistics were not clear, that the
managers shirked inquiry, that the
salaries were enormously disproportionate
to the work done&mdash;in a word,
that the least benefit accrued to
those for whom the institutions were
founded, erected, and kept a-going.
Suspicion speedily took possession
of the public mind that what went
by the name of public charity was
nothing more nor less than a system
of organized plunder.</p>

<p>That opinion is neither endorsed
nor gainsaid here. The result of
such investigations as have been
made of reports drawn up for the
past year have been simply set forth,
so that every reader may judge for
himself as to the benefits accruing
to the public from the institutions
in their midst which every year absorb
an aggregate of several millions
of public and private funds.</p>

<p>The institutions whose reports
have been examined are for children
of both sexes and of all creeds.
Some of them are more, some less,
directly under State control. All,
at least, are under State patronage.
Their aim and purport is to relieve
the State of a stupendous task&mdash;the
care and future provision for
children who, without such care
and provision, would in all probability
go astray, and become, if not
a danger, at least a burden, to the
State. On this ground the State or
city, or both together, make or makes
to each one certain apportionments
and awards of the public moneys.
Those apportionments and awards
are not in all cases equal either in
amount or in average. It is not
claimed here that they are necessarily
bound to be equal either in
amount or in average. The gift is
practically a free gift on the part of
the State, although between itself
and the institutions the award
made partakes of the nature of a
contract. So much is allowed for
the care of State wards. What may
be fairly claimed, however, is that
the awards of the State should be
regulated by justice and impartiality.
Most money ought to be given
where it is clear that most good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
is effected by it. This system of
award does not prevail.</p>

<p>Again, as these institutions undertake
the entire control of their
inmates, and to a great extent
their disposal after leaving, they
are charged with the mental, moral,
and physical training of those inmates.
A vast number of the children
are in all cases of the Catholic
faith.</p>

<p>As the general question of religion
in our public institutions
was dealt with at length in the
April number of <span class="smcap">The Catholic
World</span>, there is no need of returning
to it here further than to remind
our readers that the moral
training of Catholic children in public
institutions is utterly unprovided
for. Our main questions now are:
What do our public institutions do
for the public? What do they do
for the inmates? How much does
it cost them to do it? Whence
does the money that sustains them
come, and whither does it go?</p>

<p>It is far easier to put these questions
than to obtain a satisfactory
answer to them. Of the fitness of
putting them and the importance
of answering them fully and fairly
no man can doubt. They are
equally important to the public at
large, to the State, and to the institutions
themselves. It is fitting
and right that we know which institutions
do the best work in the
best way; which merit the support
of the public and of the State;
which, if any, are concerned chiefly
about the welfare of their inmates;
which, if any, are concerned chiefly
about the welfare of their officers
and directors. Let us see how far
the <cite>Fiftieth Annual Report of the
Managers of the Society for the Reformation
of Juvenile Delinquents</cite>
may enlighten us on these interesting
points.</p>

<p>In this institution there were received
during the year (1874)
seven hundred and twenty-four
children, of whom six hundred and
thirty-six were new inmates. The
total number in the institution for
the year was one thousand three
hundred and eighty-seven. The
average figure taken on which to
calculate the year’s expenditure is
seven hundred and forty. Whence
the children come may be inferred
from the words of the superintendent’s
report (page 38): “By its charter
the House of Refuge is authorized
to receive boys under commitment
by a magistrate from the first
three judicial districts, and girls
from all parts of the State. The
age of subjects who may be committed
is limited to sixteen years.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
State Prison Inspectors have power
to transfer young prisoners from
Sing Sing prison, under seventeen
years of age, to this institution, if
in their judgment they are proper
subjects for its discipline.…
Prior to 1847 this was the only
place, except the prisons, in the
State, authorized to receive juvenile
delinquents. At that time the
Western House of Refuge was organized
at Rochester, and boys
from the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh,
and eighth judicial districts were
directed, by the act under which
that institution was organized, to
be sent there. The State Prison
Inspectors may transfer young prisoners
from the State prisons of
Auburn and Dannemora to the
Western House, the same as from
Sing Sing here. The United States
courts, sitting within the State,
may commit youthful offenders under
sixteen years of age to either
institution. The expense for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
support of these is paid by the
United States government. Girls
from all parts of the State are sent
to this house, there being no female
department at the Western
House.”</p>

<p>The expenses for support of the
(average) seven hundred and forty
children for 1874 amounted to
$103,524 23, according to the superintendent’s
report. To defray
this, there was contributed in all
$74,968 61 of public moneys, in the
following allotments:</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>There is one remark to be made
on these figures, which have been
copied item by item from the report.
They do not tally with the report
of the State Treasurer. In his report
the award to the society is set
down as $66,500. There is evidently
a mistake somewhere. A
small item of $6,000 is missing from
the report of the society. Where
can it have gone? The president
himself, Mr. Edgar Ketchum, endorses
the figures of the superintendent
and treasurer. He tells us
(page 14) that the receipts for 1874,
“from the State Comptroller, annual
and special appropriations,”
are $60,500; but there is that
page 34 of the annual report of
the State Treasurer, which sets it
down plumply at $66,500. There
will doubtless be forthcoming an
excellent explanation of this singular
discrepancy between the reports.
The State Treasurer may have made
the mistake; but, if not, one is permitted
to ask, is this the kind of
arithmetic taught in the Society for
the Reformation of Juvenile Delinquents?</p>

<p>The remaining deficit is covered
by “labor of the inmates”&mdash;which
is rated at $41,594 48&mdash;sale of waste
articles, etc. There is no mention
whatever made of private donations.
With an exception that will be noted,
there is not a hint at such a
thing throughout the sixty-eight
pages of the report. If private donations
were received at this institution
during the year, the donors
will search the fiftieth annual report
in vain for any account of them.
Attention is called to this point, because
in every other report examined
the private donations have
been ample, duly acknowledged,
and accounted for; but the managers
of the Society for the Reformation
of Juvenile Delinquents observe
silence on this subject.</p>

<p>Looking to see how the money
went, we find the largest item of the
expenses set down as $44,521 62,
for “food and provisions.” The
next largest item is $34,880 52, for
salaries&mdash;as nearly as possible one-third
of the whole expense. This is
a very important item. One-third of
the entire expenses, and considerably
over half the net cost for the
support of the institution during the
year, was consumed in salaries. Into
the various other items it is not
necessary to go, as in these two
by far the largest portion of the expenses
is accounted for. The sum
of the remainder for “clothing,”
“fuel and light,” “bedding and
furniture,” “books and stationery
for the schools and chapel,” “ordinary
repairs,” and “hospital,”
amounts only to $27,555 84, or over
$7,000 less than the salaries; while
“all other expenses not included”
in what has already been mentioned
amount only to $23,339 23.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>As this is the fiftieth annual report,
the managers of the institution
have thought it a fitting time to
publish a review of the work done
during the last half-century and of
the cost of its doing. The “financial
statement for fifty years” informs
us that “the cost for real estate
and buildings for the use of the
institution, including repairs and
improvements,” was $745,740 31.
This amount was paid “in part by
private subscriptions and donations”&mdash;the
solitary mention to be
found of anything of the kind
throughout the report&mdash;and the remainder
“by money received for
insurance for loss by fires, money
received from sale of property in
Twenty-third Street, New York,
and by State appropriations.” The
amount of private subscriptions and
donations was $38,702 04; thus
leaving $707,038 27, by far the
greater portion of which, it is to be
presumed, was paid by State appropriations.</p>

<p>So far for the real estate and
buildings for fifty years. Let us
now look at the cost of support for
the same period.</p>

<p>Including every item of expense,
except for the grounds and buildings,
the sum total is $2,106,009 16.
Of this $767,189 31 was paid from
labor of the inmates and sale of
articles; the remaining $1,338,819
85 was paid “from moneys received
from appropriations made
by the State and by the city of New
York, from the licenses of theatres,
from the excise and marine funds.”
In short, with the exception of the
$38,702 04 already mentioned as
coming from private subscriptions
and donations, of the money received
from sale of property in
Twenty-third Street, New York, and
the amount earned by the inmates,
the State has covered the entire expenses
of the Society for the Reformation
of Juvenile Delinquents
since its founding, fifty years ago.
Those expenses, according to their
own showing, were $2,045,868 12.
Thus it is within the truth to say
that this society has received $2,000,000
from the State within the
last fifty years, one-third of which
amount, if the figures for last year
be a fair gauge, was consumed in
salaries.</p>

<p>Such has been the cost&mdash;a weighty
one. What is the result? What
has been achieved by this immense
outlay?&mdash;for immense it is. We are
informed (p. 39) that “when a
child is dismissed from the house,
an entry is made under the history,
giving the name, residence, and
occupation of the person into whose
care the boy or girl is given. Pains
are taken, by correspondence and
otherwise, to keep informed of their
subsequent career as far as possible,
and such information when received,
whether favorable or unfavorable,
is noted under the history.”</p>

<p>The result may be given briefly:
Fifteen thousand seven hundred
and ninety-one children have passed
through the institution in fifty years.
Of these thirty-eight per cent. have
been heard from “favorably,” fourteen
per cent. “unfavorably,” while
forty-eight per cent. are classified
as “unknown.” Thus it is seen
that not nearly one-half have turned
out well; a very considerable
number have turned out badly;
and of a larger number than either&mdash;of
almost half, in fact&mdash;nothing is
known. And it has taken about
three millions of dollars (a far
higher figure if the private donations,
of which no account is given,
ranked for anything) to achieve this
magnificent result!</p>

<p>We have only one comment to
offer. If, with the practically unlimited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
means at their disposal, the
managers of the society can do nothing
better for and with the children
than they have done after fifty
years of trial, the experiment is, to
say the least, a costly failure. Indeed,
it is not at all extravagant to
assert that, taking into consideration
the migratory habits of our
people and the ups and downs of
life, these children, if allowed to
run their own course, would, were
it possible to follow up their histories,
probably show as high a percentage
of “favorable” as this society
has been able to show. In
the proud words of the superintendent’s
report, “The results of
half a century of labor in the cause
of God and humanity are now before
us!”<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>An institution similar to the one
just examined is the New York
Juvenile Asylum, whose <cite>Twenty-second
Annual Report</cite> is published.
Unlike its predecessor, it acknowledges
“the readiness with which
the necessary funds, beyond those
received from the public treasury,
are supplemented by private beneficence.”
It has a Western agency,
whose business it is to “procure
suitable homes for children placed
under indenture, and conduct the
responsible work of perpetuated
guardianship, which forms the distinguishing
feature of our chartered
obligations” (<cite>Report</cite>, p. 12). We
are informed that “an analysis of
the treasurer’s report confirms the
uniform experience of the board,
that the appropriations from the
city treasury of $110, and from
the Board of Education of about
$13 50, per annum, for each child,
are inadequate to the support of
the institution on its present required
scale of superior excellence.”</p>

<p>The treasurer’s report is a study.
The expenses for the year (1874)
were $95,976 83. Of this sum $67,452
05 is set down plumply as
for “salaries, wages, supplies, etc.,
for Asylum.” How much of it was
devoted to “salaries,” how much
to “wages,” how much to “supplies,”
and how much to “etc.,”
whatever that financial mystery
may mean, is left to conjecture. A
similar entry for the House (connected
with the asylum) amounts
to $16,875 59; and a third, for the
Western agency, to $5,303 18. By
this happy arrangement there only
remain some two thousand odd
dollars to be accounted for, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the balance-sheet pleasantly closes,
leaving the reader as wise as ever
on the important query, Who gets
the lion’s share of the money, the
children or the managers?</p>

<p>To cover the expenses of the
year, the corporation gave $68,899 40;
the Board of Education, $8,833 23.
Thus public moneys covered
the great bulk of the annual
expense. The carefully-confused
figures of the treasurer make it impossible
to say whether or not a
judicious paring of the “salaries,
wages, etc.,” might not have enabled
the same moneys to cover it
all and still leave a balance in the
bank.</p>

<p>As it is hopeless to investigate
how the money went, item by item,
let us turn to the children for
whose benefit it was given.</p>

<p>The whole number in the Asylum
and House of Reception at the beginning
of the year was 617; received
during the year, 581; discharged,
585; average for the year, 617.
Of the discharged, 9 were indentured,
103 sent to the Western agency,
466 discharged to parents and
friends.</p>

<p>The managers are very strongly
in favor of placing the children in
“Western homes,” and doubtless
most persons interested in the question
of caring for these children
would agree with them, could satisfactory
evidence only be given of
the actual advantages of the plan.
But such evidence is not furnished
by any of the reports we have examined.
This asylum, for instance,
has been sending children West
year after year, and yet the superintendent
informs us, as a piece of
special news, that “in the early part
of November last the superintendent
went to Illinois, for the purpose
of becoming better acquainted with
the practical workings of the
agency, and visiting the children
sent West in their new homes.”
This is given as an event in the
workings of the institution. In
other words, the children sent out
were left absolutely to the Western
agent, who may have been a very
worthy and conscientious person, or
who may have been nothing of the
kind. The amount expended on
the Western agency would not
seem to indicate any very extensive
or arduous labors. The result of
the superintendent’s trip was a visitation
of twenty-five children, and,
on the strength of that very limited
number of visits and the representations
of the agent, he states that
“it was evident that great care was
taken and good judgment exercised
in providing children with the best
of homes and looking after their
general welfare.”</p>

<p>The Western agent himself reports:
“For sixteen years the
Asylum has been sending to Illinois,
and placing in families as apprentices,
those who have become
permanently its wards, and during
that time two thousand three hundred
and ninety-nine have been thus
cared for. Their employers have
been required to make a legal contract
in writing, binding themselves
to provide suitably for their physical
comfort during their minority,
instruct them in a specified trade,
allow them to attend school four
months in each year, <em>give them moral
and religious training</em>, and make a
stipulated payment of clothing and
money at the expiration of their
apprenticeship.… The Asylum
is required by its charter to see
that the terms of every contract are
faithfully performed throughout the
entire period of the apprenticeship.”</p>

<p>Of course these conditions are
very favorable to the children, provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
only that they are carried
out. That they are always carried
out is doubtful, and the number of
complaints made by both children
and employers, mentioned incidentally,
tend to strengthen this
doubt. Then as regards the
“moral and religious training”:
What in the case of Catholic children
such training is likely to be
may be inferred from the fact that
the Catholic religion is proscribed
in the Asylum and House, as also
from the fact mentioned by the
agent himself (p. 42) that among
the employers “prejudiced against
indentures,” “occasionally one objects
to them <em>on the ground of conscientious
scruples</em>;” “but,” he adds,
“it rarely occurs that they cannot
be prevailed upon to comply
with our regulations in this particular.”</p>

<p>What the Western “Home” is
may be judged from the following
pregnant sentence of the agent’s
report: “I am not instructed by
the committee, nor would it be
well to make it an attractive rendezvous,
and the children are
neither drawn to it by factitious
allurements nor encouraged to
make a protracted stay.” The unsolicited
testimony on this point
may be taken as unimpeachable.
He admits that “instances of
wrongs frequently come to our
knowledge, and doubtless many
others exist of which we have not
been made aware.” Accordingly,
“to prevent such abuses,” “an additional
agent has <em>recently</em> been engaged,
who will be employed exclusively
as a visitor.” This additional
agent commenced service “about
five weeks” from the date of the
Western agent’s report; but “unprecedentedly
stormy weather and
difficult travelling have rendered it
impossible for him to enter upon
his special work.” And such is all
the practical information furnished
us concerning the Western branch
of this institution, notwithstanding
that “every employer and every
apprentice is <em>written to</em> at least once
annually.”</p>

<p>The report of the agent tells us
really little or nothing. Indeed, its
tone is not at all sanguine. His
“time has been too fully occupied
to accomplish much in the way
of gathering statistics of what is,
in my belief, a demonstrable fact:
that, with as few exceptions as occur
among other children, asylum
wards become reputable and prosperous
citizens.” No doubt; proof
will be given afterwards that this
belief is well founded, but not as
regards the institution in question.
In its case, unfortunately, the demonstration
is the one thing wanting.</p>

<p>The total number of children admitted
to the institution from 1853
to 1873 is 17,035, of whom 12,975
were of native, 3,820 of foreign
birth. Ireland contributed 2,006;
France, 71; Spain, 6; Italy, 75;
South America, 5; Austria, 5;
all of whom may be safely classed
as Catholics. Of the native-born
New York alone contributed eleven
thousand five hundred and seventy-one,
all the other States together
adding only one thousand three
hundred and ninety-six. The number
of native-born children of Irish
parents in the State of New York
within the last twenty years may
be left to easy conjecture. One
thing is certain: that the faith of
all the Catholic children admitted
to this institution was, while they
remained in it, and as long as they
remained under its supervision, proscribed,
while they were compelled
to conform to the Church Established
in Public Institutions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
There is no financial statement for
the twenty years.</p>

<p>The Children’s Aid Society has
also published its <cite>Twenty-second Annual
Report</cite>. This is one of the
most extensive organizations in the
city, and has quite a net-work of
homes, lodging-houses, and industrial
schools connected with it, as
well as a Western agency similar
in its office to that already noticed.
Although not, in the accepted
sense, a “public institution,” it depends
in a great measure on State
aid for its support. It professes
to be superior in its mode of work
to any public institution. That
point is too extensive to enter upon
here. We merely pursue our plan
of searching its own record to see
what it has done. One of its chief
aims may be gathered from the following
statement of the report (page
4): “The plan which this society
has followed out so persistently
during twenty-two years, of saving
the vagrant and neglected children
of the city, by placing them in carefully-selected
homes in the West
and in the rural districts, is now
universally admitted to be successful.
It has not cost one-tenth part
of the expense which a plan demanding
support in public institutions
would have done, and has
been attended by wonderfully encouraging
moral and material results.”</p>

<p>As it is impossible within present
limits to examine every detail of
this extensive report, which fills 96
pages, we pass at once to the treasurer’s
figures. The expenses for
the past year amount to $225,747
92. To cover this the city and
county of New York contributed
$93,333 34; the Board of Education,
$32,893 95; being a total of
$126,227 29 contributed from the
public moneys. The rest is made
up by private donations, legacies
etc.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the difficulties
to be met with in trying to extract
the gist of the various reports,
the following sentence from the
one in hand may serve. In describing
“the year’s work” the
superintendent says (p. 8): “The
labors of charity of this society
have become so extended and
multifarious that it is exceedingly
difficult to give any satisfactory
picture of them.” If this is his
opinion, what is ours likely to be?
However, we will make such use of
the limited means at our disposal
as may tend to give some idea of
the workings of this society.</p>

<p>The “industrial schools” constitute
a prominent feature of it.
There are twenty-one of them and
thirteen night schools. They give
occupation to eighty-six salaried
teachers and a superintendent, and
to a volunteer corps of seventy
ladies in addition. The volunteers,
we are informed, “produce results
of which they have no adequate
idea themselves.” The industries
taught in these “industrial schools”
are not brought out very prominently.
The army of teachers, regulars
and volunteers together, have
acted upon “an average number”
of 3,556, and an aggregate number
of 10,288. Dropping the volunteers,
that gives each of the eighty-six
“salaried teachers” just 41 and
the 30/86th part of a child to devote
his or her sole attention to during
the year. It is for these schools
that the Board of Education awarded
the $32,893 95 already mentioned.</p>

<p>The schools alone consume of
the whole expenses of the society
for the year $70,509 88, which is
divided in the following pleasing
manner:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<table summary="Breakdown of the expediture">
  <tr>
    <td>Rent of school-rooms,</td>
    <td class="tdr">$11,455 25</td>

    <td>Salaries of superintendent and 86 teachers,</td>
    <td class="tdr">39,202 33</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Food, clothing, fuel, etc.,</td>
    <td class="tdr">19,852 30</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>That is to say, the salaries of
the school superintendent and 86
teachers for 3,556 children cost
considerably more than rent, food,
clothing, fuel, children, and everything
else put together. This is
worse even than the Society for
the Reformation of Juvenile Delinquents,
whose officers were modestly
contented with a good third of
the whole amount of money spent
on the institution. But here at
the present ratio more than one-half
is absorbed in salaries. The
public seems to labor under an
idea that the institutions which they
so cheerfully support are intended
chiefly for the benefit of poor children.
It is to be hoped that their
eyes may at last be opened to their
fatal mistake. At all events, in
the present instance it is clear that
the schools are less intended to instruct
the children than to support
the teachers. The very liberal allowance
granted to these schools
by the Board of Education falls
miserably below the teachers’ salaries.</p>

<p>The cheerfulness with which these
figures are contemplated by the
officers of the society is positively
exhilarating. We are informed (p.
45) that “the annual expense of
twenty-one day and thirteen evening
schools, with salaries of superintendent
and eighty-six teachers,
would be an intolerable burden to
the society, did not the city pay
semi-annually a certain sum for
each pupil, as allowed by law.”
The number of pupils paid for by
the city is, of course, 10,288&mdash;“a
gain over last year of 704.” Here
is a sample of how the list is made
up:</p>

<table summary="Attendance figures, compared to number of pupils on the rolls of each school">

  </tr>
</table>

<p>And so they go on. Comment is
unnecessary. It is to be taken for
granted that the average attendance
here given by the society is not likely
to be below the mark. Taking
it then as correct, it may be left to
honest men to judge whether half
the number of teachers would not
be amply sufficient. As to the question
of salaries, it is needless to remark
further upon that. Who can
resist the piteous appeal of the treasurer
after closing the account of
the “thirty-four” schools? “Surely,
then,” he says, “this branch of
the society’s work may claim the
merit of economy when considered
in detail, although the aggregate
cost is large.”</p>

<p>Mention of salaries occurs twice
after. Five “executive officers”
are paid $8,944 14; five “visitors,”
$3,944 06. The total “current expenses”
are set down at $174,821
38. Thus, as seen, salaries already
absorb more than a quarter of the
current expenses, and the chief salaried
officers of the institution, as
well as another small army of inferior
officials, remain to be portioned
off. No mention is made of them
in the treasurer’s figures. Nor will
it do to average the salaries of the
superintendent and eighty-six teachers
of the schools, setting them
down at the modest allowance of
$450 a head, granting, as seems incredible,
considering the number of
pupils, that the number of teachers
is accurately given. The point is
plain to all men: There is no need
for such a number of teachers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Some of them, it is to be presumed,
are only employed in the night-schools;
consequently their salaries
would be considerably diminished.
The salaries are not all equal, and,
even were they all equal, the amount
of work done would be too costly
at the price. To say that twenty-one
schools and eighty-seven teachers,
with a contingent of seventy
volunteers, are needed for 3,446
children is simple nonsense.</p>

<p>Judging by what we have seen, if
one-fourth the moneys spent on the
Children’s Aid Society is devoted
exclusively to the children, both
children and public are to be congratulated
on the self-denial of the
management. It is for those who
support the society to consider how
long this state of things is to continue.</p>

<p>Among other benevolent works
undertaken by the society is an
Italian school, for the special benefit
of the poor little Italian children
decoyed from their homes to labor
and beg for <i lang="it">padroni</i> and such like
in this city and elsewhere throughout
the country. There can be no
doubt about the religion of these
children. The report informs us
that this school is under the care
of the “Italian School Young Men’s
Association.” Their “collection
of books has been enlarged by the
contributions of friends, and the
reading-room will soon contain a
large assortment of Italian books
forwarded by the Italian government,
who, with provident care,
watches over our work and furthers
the benevolent purposes of
the Children’s Aid Society.”</p>

<p>The object of organizing such a
school is evident. There is no incentive
so effective with the large
majority of Protestant hearts, nothing
so well calculated to draw
contributions from their pockets,
as the hope to “convert to Christianity”
Papist children. This
school is intended for just such a
purpose, and the society would be
the last in the world to deny it.
“The increase of <em>newly-arrived</em>
children attests the popularity of
the school. The benevolence of
our patrons continues to make itself
unceasingly felt in various ways,
more especially at the Christmas
festival, when the congregation of
<em>the First Presbyterian Church</em>&mdash;Dr.
Paxton’s&mdash;come almost in a body
to gladden our children with useful
and substantial gifts, and an outpouring
of unmistakable Christian
sympathy” (page 32).</p>

<p>The Western agency of this society
is on a par with that already examined.
The number of miles
travelled by the agents is given, as
also the number of children placed
out. The very names of the agents
bristle with activity. They are:
Messrs. Trott, Skinner, Fry, Brace,
and Gourley. The warm temperament
of Mr. Fry, “the resident
Western agent,” may be judged from
the opening of his report. He
writes from St. Paul, Minnesota, under
date October 18, 1874, to tell us:
“I am up among the saints, and
ought to feel encouraged; but it
seems such a hopeless task to convey
to others the happiness and
contentment I witness in my rounds
of visitation that I always commence
my annual report with a degree
of hesitation.”</p>

<p>There are many passages of equal
beauty with this, but unfortunately
Mr. Fry’s pious enthusiasm is not
exactly what is called for. What we
want to know is what has actually
been done with the 1,880 boys and
the 1,558 girls whom we are informed
by the report “have been provided
with homes and employment”
during the year. Men and women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
to the number of 242 and 305 respectively
were sent out also during
the year. Of the entire 3,985, 657
were Irish, 28 French, 13 Italian, 8
Poles, 10 Austrians&mdash;all of whom
may be set down as Catholics. The
“American born” were 1,866, the
German, 879. Of these also a fair
percentage were probably Catholic.
What has become of them and of
all? What has become of the 36,363
who have been sent out in the
same manner by the same society
since 1853? How many prospered?
How many failed? How many
died? How many turned out well?
How many ill? What was done
for the Catholic portion of the emigrants?
It is absurd to put such
questions to Mr. Fry, who is “up
among the saints,” “wrapped in the
third heaven” of S. Paul. A man
in such an exalted state of terrestrial
beatitude cannot be expected
to descend to such sublunary matters
as those presented. Consequently,
Mr. Fry contents himself
with vague generalities and a few
specimen letters of the kind characterized
at the beginning of this
article.</p>

<p>However, “Mr. Macy and his
clerks in the office have kept up, as
usual, a vast correspondence with
the thousands of children sent out
by us. We unfortunately can have
room but for a few of the numerous
encouraging letters that have been
received.” We may be permitted
to give one, which will explain
itself and also what is in store for
the Catholic children cared for by
this society. Needless to say, it
does not find a place in the report
which we have been examining. It
is, however, an authentic copy, as
Mr. Macy himself will testify, if
necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. Macy’s letter, or the letter
signed by him, needs a little explanation,
most of which will be
supplied by the letter from the
“American Female Guardian Society,”
which is also given. The
story in brief concerns two Catholic
children, a boy and girl, whose
mother was dead and whose father
was called away to the late war.
They fell into the hands of the
Female Guardian Society, who
handed them over to the Children’s
Aid Society to be “provided with
homes in the West” or elsewhere.
The boy was sent to a Protestant
in Dubuque, Iowa, the girl to a
Methodist family in the State of
New York. After returning from
the war and coming out of hospital
the father was anxious to learn
something of his children. His
efforts were futile until, as said in
the letters, he interested the Society
of S. Vincent de Paul in the
matter. After such trouble as may
be imagined the society succeeded
in gaining possession of the children.
<em>They had both become, or
rather been made, Protestants</em>, and
hated the very mention of their religion.

<p class="noindent">Mr. Wilson:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: Very unexpectedly to us, a
few days since the father of Edward Nugent,
came to the Home, to inquire about
his children, we had not seen him for six
years, and as he had not even written
during that time, we supposed he was
dead; he has been in the Hospital it
appears most of the time, is lame, having
been injured in the feet during the war,
he is not able to take care of his children,
yet still claims he has a right to know
where they are, though <em>we</em> do not feel
after all these years he has any claim at
all, but we learned something of importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
yesterday, which explains why he
wants to know the children’s whereabouts,
it seems he is a Catholic, and has been to
the priests with his story about us whom
they call heretics, and the priests have influenced
him to demand the children, so
we felt it our duty to let you know how
the matter stands, for they are very persistent,
and may send some one in that
part of the country to ask the neighbours
around there, if such a boy is in that
neighbourhood, and if they can get him,
no other way they will steal him, so
if you have become attached to the child,
and would desire to save his soul from
the power of the destroyer of souls, we
would say to you it would be better for
you to send the boy away for a year from
you, that you could say truthfully you do
not know where he is; <em>when fourteen</em> he
can choose his own guardian, then if he
chooses you, no power can take him from
you. Had he been fully committed to us
they would have no right to interfere, but
as he was not, they will do all in their
power to get him from you, we would feel
very sorry to have them find him, as we
dread Catholic influence more than the
bite of the rattle-snake, for that only destroys
the body while the other destroys
the immortal soul, too precious to be lost;
if you have become attached to that dear
boy, save him from the power of the fell-destroyer,
and the conscious approving
smile of your Heavenly Father will be
your reward. I cannot say what course
they will pursue, but if you wish the child,
you must be very guarded how you act,
and must <em>not</em> confide in anyone, not even
your own brother what your plans are,
act cautiously, but decidedly. Please
write immediately on receipt of this, and
let us know what your course will be, as
we feel the deepest interest in the matter.

<p>To comment on the letter of the
“Female Guardians” or the easy
conscience of the “Children’s Aid
Society” would be “to gild refined
gold”; certainly, in the case of
Mrs. C. Spaulding, “to paint the
lily.” Honest-minded men of any
creed may now understand why it
is that Catholics who have any
faith in their religion at all, who
believe it in their conscience to be
the only true religion, demand in
the name of justice that associations
and institutions of this character be
thrown open to the ministers of
their religion, or that the State, to
prevent all that is shameful and
horrible in proselytism, imitate all
civilized states, and adopt the denominational
system of charities,
which, as will be shown in the case
of Catholics at least, will not only
not cost it a penny more, but considerably
less, and with results astounding
in their contrast.</p>

<p>We have now examined three of
our principal institutions with a
view to their cost and results. With
the exception of the two letters
quoted, no information has been
used which is not presented in public
reports. It is seen that the Society
for Juvenile Delinquents expends
one-third of its resources in
salaries; the Children’s Aid Society,
as far as it is possible to base<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
an opinion on its loose and incomplete
figures, perhaps three-fourths;
while the figures of the
Juvenile Asylum are too confused to
allow of any judgment in the matter
at all. The results as affecting the
children, in the first instance, are
avowedly far from satisfactory; in
the second and third instances no
attempt is made to give such results,
though the inferences to be
drawn from such evidence as is
given are far from hopeful. And
so, unless a radical change is effected
in the training and management
of the institutions, matters are
likely to continue. The excuse of
inexperience in the management
cannot hold here with half a century
at the back of one and over
twenty years at the back of the
other two. The moral training of
the children is in all instances distinctly
and avowedly Protestant.
As shown sufficiently in a previous
article, there is no such thing possible
as a religious education which
is “non-sectarian.” Consequently,
Catholic children, who form a large
contingent of the inmates of these
institutions, are subjected to a
course of instruction and moral
training which is a gross and persistent
violation of the rights of
conscience and of the constitution
of the State, and to this training
have they been subjected ever since
the institutions were first founded.
The only means of adjusting this
grave difficulty, of righting this
great wrong, is to follow out the
plan which prevails in every civilized
country with the exception of
our own, of either adopting the denominational
system, or at least of
allowing free access to the clergymen
of the religious denomination
professed by the children. The
means of adjusting the salaries so
as to bear a more rational proportion
to the work done is for the
public to consider.</p>

<p>The effects of the denominational
system are exemplified in the
New York Catholic Protectory,
which has just presented its <cite>Twelfth
Annual Report</cite>. An examination
of its working cannot fail to be instructive,
inasmuch as it was founded
expressly to meet the difficulty
noticed above concerning the Catholic
inmates of public institutions.
From the beginning it has been
looked on rather as an enemy than
a friend by those who work the engine
of the State. At the very least
it was regarded as a suspicious intruder
into ground already occupied.
It was Catholic, therefore
sectarian; therefore not a State
institution, and consequently not
to be supported by the State. State
funds could not go to teach Catholic
doctrine. But we need not repeat
the arguments against it.
They are too well known, and are
met once for all by the provision in
the constitution allowing liberty of
conscience and freedom of worship
to all members of the State. If
moral and religious training be provided
for children in all our public
institutions, it is against all conscience,
law, right, and the spirit
of the American people at large to
convert that moral and religious
training into a system of proselytizing,
no matter to what creed. In
the case of Catholic children such
a system, as known and shown, has
prevailed from the beginning; and
the first step in the reformation
of a Catholic child has been to
seek by every means possible to
make it a renegade from its faith.</p>

<p>At the opening of the year there
were in the Protectory 1,842 children;
during the year 2,877; average
(entitled to per capita contributions),
1,871. To their support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
all that was contributed of public
moneys was the <i lang="la">per capita</i> allowance
for each child, which is common to
all the children of the institutions
examined. Nothing was allowed
by the Board of Education, although
the children are educated;
nothing by “special appropriations”;
nothing from “theatre
licenses”; nothing from “excise
funds”&mdash;nothing in a word, from
any source at all, save the bare
<i lang="la">per capita</i> allowance.</p>

<p>This is not an exceptional instance,
but the normal relation between
the Catholic Protectory and
the State. Within the twelve years
of its existence the whole amount
of State aid received by it, through
share of charity fund, special grants,
or from whatever source, has
amounted to $93,502 08&mdash;that is to
say, at not $8,000 per annum&mdash;while
its entire grant for building
purposes was $100,000.</p>

<p>The current expenses for the
past year were $211,349 87. This
includes all outlays, except for the
construction of buildings or other
permanent improvements. The <i lang="la">per
capita</i> allowance, received from the
comptroller covered $192,339 22
of this amount. It is to be borne
in mind that this allowance would
have been paid for the children in
any case, whatever institution they
had entered. Consequently, it is
no favor at all to the Protectory.
The remaining $19,010 65 had to
be met by the charity of private individuals
or not met at all. Of
course the labor of the inmates and
the produce of the farm covered
a considerable sum; but the age
of the children admitted to the
Protectory is limited to fourteen
years, and the vast majority of
them are considerably under fourteen,
and consequently cannot contribute
by their labor so efficiently
as the inmates of the Society for
Juvenile Delinquents, whose average
age runs so much higher.</p>

<p>But the expenses by no means
ended here. The Protectory is
still really in course of erection.
The aggregate expenditures during
the past year for buildings and
permanent improvements, “all of
which were indispensable for the
carrying out of the mandate of the
State in the shelter and protection
of its wards,” were $107,491 65. To
this heavy sum State and city contributed
nothing at all. The bare
<i lang="la">per capita</i> allowance was the only
public money received to aid in the
sheltering, educating, clothing, and
feeding of these wards of the State;
while to all other public institutions,
even to institutions not strictly
public, liberal special grants or appropriations
from special funds
were made. The Catholic Protectory
alone was left to meet a bill
of $126,502 30 as best it might.</p>

<p>In its struggle for existence the
Protectory has had little in the
shape of aid for which to thank the
State. There was great fear even
within the present year that the <i lang="la">per
capita</i> allowance would also be
withdrawn, avowedly because the
Protectory was a Catholic institution,
and consequently without the
range of assistance from public
funds. This is highly conscientious,
no doubt. But the report of
the State Treasurer for the past
year shows grant after grant to
seminaries and “sectarian” (to use
the orthodox word) institutions of
every kind, with the sole exception
of those professing the Catholic
faith. A glance at the whole work
done by the Protectory and the aid
afforded it by the State shows the
following:</p>

<p>It has been twelve years in existence.
Within that period it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
“sheltered, clothed, afforded elementary
education, and given instruction
in useful trades” to 8,771
children. This work cost in the
aggregate for current, expenses
$1,257,189 41. To this sum the
State contributed through the
comptroller out of the city taxes
$1,057,578 66. This was merely
the <i lang="la">per capita</i> allowance still.
There remained, consequently, for
current expenses $199,610 75 to be
paid by whatever means possible.</p>

<p>But the Protectory had to be
built. Land had to be purchased,
buildings to be erected, and so on.
In a word, the Protectory, like all
other institutions, had to grow,
while there was a ravenous demand,
as there continues to be, for
admission within its walls. In
these twelve years the outlays for
land, buildings, and other permanent
improvements amounted to
$806,211 74. The amount of contracts
now being carried to completion
on the girls’ building, new
gas-house, etc., is over $100,000.
To help to meet this necessary sum
of $906,211 74 the State made a
munificent grant for building purposes
of $100,000; while all
its other grants, of whatever kind,
amounted to just $93,502 28. This
left another little bill for the Protectory
to meet of $912,320 21 by
the best means it could. Is it to be
wondered at that there rests on the
institution a floating debt of some
$200,000, which seriously threatens
its existence? Our wonder is,
with the encouragement which
it has received from the State and
city, that it continues to exist at
all. Private charity has been its
mainstay thus far; but private
charity has always an abundance
of pressing demands on it, and may
at any time give out, for the very
best of reasons, in a case where
there is really no great call for private
charity at all. The children
thus cared for, for whom these vast
sums have been paid, would have
had in any case to be supported
by the State, and would have proved
a costlier burden than in their
present hands. All we urge is
that the State be just; that it assist
this institution in the same manner
in which it assists other institutions,
by grants from the same
funds, by appropriations from the
same sources, without cavil about
religion or no religion. The crime
of instructing these children in
their own religion is evidenced in
the results achieved. Of the 8,771
who have passed through the Protectory
since its opening, <em>exactly
two have turned out badly</em>. So much
for Catholic education and mental
and moral training.</p>

<p>We have reserved for the last an
examination of the salaries. The
entire amount expended on salaries
for the officers and employés of
every branch of the institution is
$20,736 51; that is, between one-tenth
and one-eleventh of the sum
total of the current expenses of the
year. This is the year’s pay of all
officials and employés of an institution
which cared for and sheltered
within its walls for that period
2,877 children. Contrast this with
the $34,880 52 paid the officials
and employés of the Society for
Juvenile Delinquents for the care
during the same period of 1,387
children, and the $39,202 33 paid
by the Children’s Aid Society for
the teachers of 3,556 children. Contrast
the result of the labors of each
society. Then contrast the sums
lavished by city and State from
special appropriations and funds
on societies whose chief claim for
such special grants consists in their
devoting so large a portion of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
means to salaries, with their persistent
deafness to the urgent appeals
of a society which has only good
to show everywhere and an army
of workers such as the Brothers and
Sisters, whose salary is embraced
in their food and dress. Let us
look at these things, and blush at
our pretensions to justice and liberality.
Why, it is not even honesty.
We are too conscientious to grant a
penny out of the educational fund
to Catholic children educated by
Catholics, while we give thousands
freely for the stowing away of Catholic
children in asylums that pervert
them and can give no account
of their stewardship. It is
time to drop “conscience,” that
counterfeit so recently and so
admirably described by Dr. Newman,
and fall back on common-sense.
Of the institutions here
examined the Catholic Protectory
combines beyond comparison the
greatest economy with the most
extraordinarily successful results as
affecting the wards of the State.
Such an institution has a solemn
and the truest claim on the heartiest
co-operation and favor of the
State.</p>

<h3>ARE YOU MY WIFE?</h3>

<p class="center">BY THE AUTHOR OF “PARIS BEFORE THE WAR,” “NUMBER THIRTEEN,” “PIUS VI.,” ETC.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER V.</h4>

<p>Angélique was having a field
day of it, and there was nothing she
liked better. It was an event when
Sir Simon dropped in at The Lilies
toward supper-time, and announced
his intention of staying to take pot-luck;
but this evening’s entertainment
was a very different affair
from these friendly droppings-in,
and Angélique was proportionately
flurried. Like most people who
have a strong will and a good temper,
she was easy to live with; her
temper was indeed usually so well
controlled that few suspected her
of having one. But on occasions like
the present they were apt to find
out their mistake; it was not safe
to come in her way when she had
more than one extra dish on hand.
Franceline knew this; and after
such interference in the way of
whipping the eggs and dusting the
glass and china as Angélique would
tolerate, she took herself off to the
woods for the remainder of the
afternoon. There was a cleared
space where the timber had been
cut down in spring, and here she
settled herself on the stem of a
felled tree, and opened her book.
It can hardly have been a very
interesting one; for, after turning
over a few pages, she began to
look about her, and to listen to the
contralto recitative of a wood-pigeon
with as much attention as if
that familiar <i lang="fr">dilettante</i> performance
had been some striking novelty.
It was not long, however, before
sounds of a very different sort broke
on her ear. Some one was crying
passionately, filling the wood with
shrieks and sobs. Franceline started
to her feet and listened; she
could distinguish the shrill treble
of a child’s voice, and, hurrying on
in the direction from whence it proceeded,
she soon came upon a little
girl, the daughter of a poor woman
of the neighborhood, called Widow
Bing. The child was lying in a
heap on the ground, her basketful
of school-books and lunch spilt on
the grass beside her, while her little
body and soul seemed literally torn
to pieces by sobs.</p>

<p>“Why, Bessy, what’s the matter?”
cried Franceline. “Have you hurt
yourself?”</p>

<p>“No-o-o-o!” gasped Bessy, without
lifting her head.</p>

<p>“Have you broken something?”</p>

<p>“No-o-o-o!”</p>

<p>“Has anything happened to
mammy?”</p>

<p>“No-o-o, but something’s a-goin
to.” And the child raised her
head for a louder scream, and let it
drop again with a thud on the
ground.</p>

<p>“What’s going to happen to her?
Tell me, there’s a good child,”
coaxed Franceline, crouching down
beside the little, prostrate figure,
and trying to make it look up. “If
it hasn’t happened, perhaps it will
never happen. I might prevent it,
or somebody else might.”</p>

<p>A dim ray of consolation apparently
dawned out of this hypothesis
on Bessy’s mind; she lifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
her head, and, after suppressing
her sobs, exclaimed: “Mammy’s
a-goin’ to be damned, she is!”</p>

<p>“Good gracious, child, what a
dreadful thing for you to say!” exclaimed
Franceline, too much shocked
by the announcement to catch
the comical side of it at once.
“Who put such a naughty thing
into your head?”</p>

<p>“It’s Farmer Griggs as said it.
He says as how he knows mammy’s
a-goin’ to be damned!” And the
sound of her own words was so
dreadful that it sent Bessy into a
fresh paroxysm, and she shrieked
louder than before.</p>

<p>“He’s a wicked man, and you
mustn’t mind him,” said Franceline;
“he knows nothing about
it!”</p>

<p>“Ye-e-es he does!” insisted
Bessy. “He-e-s not wicked; …
he prea-a-a-ches every Sunday at
the cha-a-a-pel, he does.”</p>

<p>“Then he preaches very wicked
sermons, I’m sure,” said Franceline,
who saw an argument on the wrong
side for Farmer Griggs’ sanctity in
this evidence. “You must leave off
crying and not mind him.”</p>

<p>But Bessy was not to be comforted
by this negative suggestion. She
went on crying passionately, until
Franceline, finding that neither
scolding nor coaxing had the desired
effect, threatened to tell Miss
Bulpit, and have her left out from
the next tea and cake feast; whereupon
Bessy brightened up with extraordinary
alacrity, gathered up
her books and her dry bread and
apple, and proceeded to trot along
by the side of Franceline, who soothed
her still further by the promise
of a piece of bread and jam from
Angélique, if she gave up crying
altogether and told her all about
mammy and Farmer Griggs. An occasional
sob showed every now and
then that the waters had not quite
subsided; but Bessy did her best,
and before they reached The Lilies
she had given in somewhat disjointed
sentences the following history
of the prophecy and what led to it.
The widow Bing&mdash;who, for motives
independent of all theological views,
had recently joined the Methodist
Connection, of which Farmer Griggs
was a burning and shining light&mdash;had
been laid up for the last month
with the rheumatism, and consequently
unable to attend the meeting;
but last Sunday, being a good
deal better, though still unequal to
toiling up-hill to the chapel, which
was nearly half an hour’s walk from
her cottage, she had compromised
matters by going to church, which
was within ten minutes’ walk of her.
This scandal spread quickly through
the Connection, and was not long
coming to Farmer Griggs’ ears, who
straightway declared that the widow
Bing had thrown in her lot with the
transgressors, and was henceforth a
castaway whose name should be
blotted out. This fearful doom impending
over her mother had just
been made known to Bessy by Farmer
Griggs’ boy, who met her tripping
along with her basket on her
arm, and singing to herself as she
went. The sight of the child’s gayety
under such appalling circumstances
was not a thing to be tolerated; so
he conveyed to Bessy in very comprehensible
vernacular the soothing
intelligence that her mother was “a
bad ’un as was gone over to the
parson, as means the devil, and how
as folk as was too lazy to come to
chapel ’ud find it ’arder a-goin’
down to the bottomless pit, where
there was devils and snakes and all
manner o’ dreadful things a-blazin’
and a-burnin’ like anythink!”</p>

<p>All this Franceline contrived to
elicit from Bessy by the time they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
reached The Lilies, where they found
Miss Merrywig sitting outside the
kitchen-window in high confabulation
with Angélique, busy inside at
her work. The day was intensely
hot, and the sun was still high
enough to make shade a necessity
of existence for everybody except
cats and bees; but there sat Miss
Merrywig under the scorching glare,
with a large chinchilla muff in her
lap.</p>

<p>“A muff!” cried Franceline,
standing aghast before the old lady.
“Dear Miss Merrywig, you don’t
mean to say you want it on such a
day as this! Why, it suffocates one
to look at it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear, just so. As you
say, it suffocates one to look at it,”
assented Miss Merrywig, “and I
assure you I didn’t find it at <em>all</em>
comfortable carrying it to-day; but
I <em>only</em> bought it yesterday, and I
wanted to let Angélique see it and
hear her opinion on it, you see. I
went in to Newford yesterday, and
they were selling off at Whilton’s,
the furrier’s, and this muff struck
me as <em>such</em> a bargain that I thought
I could <em>not</em> do better than take it.
Now, what <em>do</em> you think I gave for
it? Don’t <em>you</em> say anything, Angélique;
I want to hear what mademoiselle
will say herself. Now, just
look well at it. Remember how
hot the weather is; as you say, the
sight of fur suffocates one, and that
makes <em>such</em> a difference. My dear
mother used to say&mdash;and she <em>was</em> a
judge of fur, you know; she made a
voyage to Sweden with my father in
poor dear old Sir Hans Neville’s
yacht, and that gave her such a knowledge
of furs&mdash;you know Sweden <em>is</em> a
great place for all sorts of furs&mdash;well,
she used to say, ‘If you want
the value of your money in fur, buy
it in the summer.’ I only just mention
that to show you. But you
can see for yourself whether I got
the full value in this one. You see
it is lined with satin&mdash;and such
splendid satin! As thick as a
board, and <em>so</em> glossy! And it’s silk
all through. I just ripped a bit
here at the edge to see if it was a
cotton back; but it’s all pure silk.
The young man of the shop was so
<em>extremely</em> polite, and <em>so</em> anxious I
should understand that it <em>was</em> a
bargain, he called my attention to
the quality of the satin&mdash;which was
<em>really</em> very kind of him; for of course
that didn’t matter to <em>him</em>. But they
are wonderfully civil at Whilton’s.
I remember buying some swan’s-down
to trim a dress when I was
a girl and I was bridesmaid to Lady
Arabella Wywillyn&mdash;they lived
at the Grange then&mdash;and it <em>was</em>, I
must say, a most excellent piece of
swan’s-down, and cleaned like new.
I asked the young man if he remembered
it&mdash;I meant, of course,
the marriage. Dear me, what a
sensation it did make! But he did
not, which was of course natural, as
it was long before he was born; but
I thought he might have heard the
old people of the place speak of it.
Well, now that you’ve examined it,
tell me, what <em>do</em> you think I gave
for it?”</p>

<p>Franceline was hovering on the
brink of a guess, when Angélique,
who had returned to her saucepans,
suddenly reappeared at the window,
and, spying Bessy’s red face
staring with all its eyes at the
chinchilla muff&mdash;which looked uncommonly
like a live thing that
might bite if the fancy took it, and
was best considered from a respectful
distance&mdash;called out: “What’s
that child doing there?” Franceline,
thankful for the timely rescue,
began to pour out volubly in
French the story of Farmer Griggs
and the widow Bing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s a shame these sort of people
<em>should</em> be allowed to terrify the
poor people,” said Miss Merrywig
when she had taken it all in. “I
<em>wonder</em> the vicar does not do something.
He <em>ought</em> to take steps to
stop it; there’s no saying what <em>may</em>
be the end of it. But dear Mr.
Langrove is <em>so</em> kind and so <em>very</em>
much afraid of annoying anybody!”</p>

<p>While Miss Merrywig was delivering
this opinion Angélique was
making good the bread-and-jam
promise for Bessy, who stood
watching the operation with distended
eyes through the open window,
and saw with satisfaction that
the grenadier was laying on the jam
very thick.</p>

<p>“Now, you’re not going to cry
any more, and you’re going to be a
good girl?” said Franceline before
she let Bessy seize the tempting
slice that Angélique held out to
her.</p>

<p>Bessy promised unhesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Stop a minute,” said Franceline,
as the child stretched up on
tiptoe to clutch the prize. “You
must not repeat to poor, sick mammy
what that naughty boy said to
you. Do you promise?” But the
proximity of bread and jam was not
potent enough to hurry Bessy into
committing herself to this rash
promise. What between the sudden
vision of “devils and snakes
a-blazin’ and a-burnin’” which the
demand conjured up again, and
what between the dread of seeing
the bread and jam snatched away
by the grenadier, who stood there,
brown and terrible, waiting a signal
from Franceline, her feelings were
too much for her; there was a preparatory
sigh and a sob, and down
streamed the tears again.</p>

<p>“I’d better go home with her,
and tell the poor woman myself,”
said Franceline, appealing to Miss
Merrywig.</p>

<p>“Yes, you come ’ome and tell
mammy!” sobbed the child, who
seemed to have some vague belief
in Franceline’s power to avert the
threatened doom.</p>

<p>“I dare say that will be the safest
way, and I’m sure it’s the kindest,”
said Miss Merrywig; “but it
<em>will</em> be a dreadfully hot walk for
you on the road, my dear, with <em>no</em>
shelter but your sunshade. I had
better go <em>with</em> you. I don’t mind
the heat; you see I’m <em>used</em> to it.”
Franceline could not exactly see
how this fact of Miss Merrywig’s
company would lessen the heat to
her; but it was meant in kindness,
so she assented. The meadowlands
went flowering down to the
river, richly planted with fine old
trees, and only separated from the
garden and its adjoining fields by
an invisible iron rail, so that the
little cottage looked as if it were in
the centre of a great private park.
A short cut through the fields took
you out on the road in a few minutes,
and the trio had not gone far
when they saw Mr. Langrove walking
at a brisk pace on before them,
his umbrella tilted to one side to
screen him from the sun, that was
striking him obliquely on the right
ear. Franceline clapped her hands
and called out, and they soon came
up to him.</p>

<p>“What are you doing down here,
may I ask? Having your face burned,
eh?” said the vicar familiarly.</p>

<p>Franceline burst out with her
story at once. The vicar made a
short, impatient gesture, and they
all walked on together, Bessy holding
fast by Franceline’s gown with
one hand, while the other was doing
duty with the bread and jam.</p>

<p>“Really, my <em>dear</em> Mr. Langrove,”
broke in Miss Merrywig, “you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
<em>ought</em> to take steps; excuse me for
saying so, but you <em>really</em> ought. It’s
quite dreadful to think of the man’s
frightening the poor people in this
way. You really <em>should</em> put a stop
to it.”</p>

<p>“My good lady,” replied the
vicar, “if you can tell me how it’s
to be done, there’s nothing will give
me greater pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course you know best;
but it seems to me something ought
to be done. The poor people are
all falling into dissent as fast as
they can; it’s quite melancholy to
think of it&mdash;it <em>really</em> is. You’ll excuse
me for saying so&mdash;for it must
be <em>very</em> painful to your feelings,
and I never <em>do</em> interfere with what
doesn’t concern me; though of
course what concerns you, as our
pastor, and the Church of England,
<em>does</em> concern us, all of us&mdash;but I
really think you <em>are</em> too forbearing.
You ought to enforce your
authority a <em>little</em> more strictly.”</p>

<p>“Authority!” echoed the vicar
with a mild, ironical laugh. “What
authority have I to enforce? Show
me that first!”</p>

<p>“Dear <em>me</em>! But an ordained
minister of the church, the church
of the realm&mdash;surely, <em>that</em> gives you
authority?”</p>

<p>“Just as much as you and other
members of the church choose to
accredit me with, and no more,”
said Mr. Langrove, with as much
bitterness in the emphasis as he was
capable of. “If Griggs thinks fit
to set himself up as a preacher,
and every man, woman, and child
in my parish choose to desert me
and go over to him, I can no more
prevent them than I can prevent
their buying their sugar at market
instead of getting it from the grocers.”</p>

<p>“And who is Monsieur Greegs?”
inquired Franceline, who was backward
in gossip, and knew few of
the local notabilities except by
sight.</p>

<p>“Monsieur Griggs is a very respectable
farmer, a shrewd judge of
cattle, who knows a great deal
about the relative merits of short-horns
and the Devonshire breed,
and all about pigs and poultry,”
said the vicar with mild sarcasm.</p>

<p>“And he is a minister too!”</p>

<p>“After a fashion. He elected
himself to the office, and it would
seem he has plenty of followers.
He started services on week-days
when he found that I had commenced
having them on Fridays, and
drew away the very portion of the
congregation they were specially
intended for; and he preaches on
Sundays. You have a sample of his
style here,” nodding at Bessy, who
was licking her fingers with great
gusto, having finished her last
mouthful.</p>

<p>“Is it not dreadful!” exclaimed
Miss Merrywig. “And the people
<em>are</em> so infatuated; they actually
tell me that they understand this
man better than their clergymen,
that he speaks plainer to them, and
understands better what they want,
and that sort of thing. They don’t
care about doctrine, you see, or
controversy; they like to be talked
to in a kind of conversational way
by one of their own class who
speaks bad grammar like themselves.
They tell you to your face
that they don’t understand the
clergyman&mdash;I assure you they do;
that his sermons are too learned,
and only fit for gentle folk. You
see they <em>are</em> so ignorant, the poor
people! It’s very melancholy to
think of.”</p>

<p>“They like better to be told
they’ll go to hell and be damned,
if they go to their own church;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
they ought not to be allowed to go
to hear such things. I’ll speak to
widow Bing, and make her promise
me she’ll never go there again,”
said Franceline peremptorily.</p>

<p>“No, no, my dear child; you
mustn’t do anything of the kind,”
said the vicar quickly. “No one
has a right to meddle with the
people in these things; if she likes
to go to the dissenters, no one can
prevent her.”</p>

<p>“But if she was fond of going into
the gin-shop and getting tipsy,
you’d have a right to meddle and
to prevent her, would you not?”
inquired Franceline.</p>

<p>“That’s a different thing,” said
the vicar, who in his own mind
thought the parallel was not so
very wide of the mark.</p>

<p>“I can’t see it,” protested Franceline
with an expressive shrug.
“If you have a right to prevent
their bodies from getting tipsy, and
killing themselves or somebody else
perhaps, why not their souls?”</p>

<p>The vicar laughed a complacent
little laugh at this cogent reasoning
of his young friend. “Unfortunately,”
he said, “we have no authority
for interfering with people
in the management of their souls in
this country. Such a proceeding
would be quite unconstitutional;
the state only legislates for the
salvation of their bodies.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, just <em>so</em>!” ejaculated
Miss Merrywig. “I remember my
dear mother telling me that a very
clever man&mdash;I’m not sure if he <em>wasn’t</em>
a member of Parliament, but anyhow
he made speeches <em>in</em> public&mdash;and
he said&mdash;I really think it <em>was</em>
an electioneering speech just at the
time the Catholic Emancipation
bill was being passed&mdash;that in this
<em>free</em> country every man had a right
to go to the devil his <em>own</em> way.
How exceedingly shocking! To
think of people’s going to the devil
at all! But that’s just it. They
prefer to go their <em>own</em> way, and,
as you say, the law can’t prevent
them. It’s entirely a question of
personal influence, you see.”</p>

<p>“Then perhaps Sir Simon could
do something,” suggested Franceline;
“he’s master here, and he
makes everybody do what he likes.
Why don’t you speak to him, monsieur?”</p>

<p>“He might do something, perhaps,
if anybody could; but, unfortunately,
he does not see it,” observed
the vicar.</p>

<p>“I’ll speak to him. I’ll make
him see it,” said Franceline, who
flew with a woman’s natural instinct
to arbitrary legislation as the readiest
mode of redressing wrongs, and
had, moreover, a strong faith in her
own power of making Sir Simon
“see it.”</p>

<p>“But is this not rather&mdash;of course
you know best, only it <em>does</em> strike
me that it is a case for the bishop’s
interference <em>rather</em> than the
squire’s,” said Miss Merrywig. She
was a remnant of the old times
when a bishop could hold his own;
that was before ritualism came
into vogue.</p>

<p>“Yes,” cried Franceline, with
sudden exultation, “of course it’s
the bishop who must do it. You
ought to write to him, monsieur!”</p>

<p>Mr. Langrove smiled. “The bishop
has no more power to interfere
with the proceedings of my
parishioners than you have.”</p>

<p>“Then what has he power to
do? What are bishops good for?”
demanded the obtuse young Papist.</p>

<p>But Mr. Langrove, being a loyal
“churchman,” was not going to
enter on such slippery, debatable
ground as this. He was happily
saved from the disagreeable process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
of beating about the bush for
an answer by the fact of their being
close by widow Bing’s door,
from which there issued distinctly
a twofold sound as of somebody
crying and somebody else exhorting.
Bessy no sooner caught it
than she swelled the chorus of
lamentation by breaking forth into
a loud cry. If there was any weeping
to be done, Bessy was not the
one to be behindhand. And now
she was resolved to do her very
best; for perhaps the prophecy was
already coming true, and mammy
was beginning to be a prey to the
snakes and devils.</p>

<p>“Stay here and keep that child
quiet,” said the vicar hastily. “I
hear Miss Bulpit’s voice. I had
better go in alone.”</p>

<p>“He is greatly to be pitied, poor
Mr. Langrove! I think,” said Franceline,
as she turned back with
Miss Merrywig. “I think you all
ought to write to the bishop for
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that <em>would</em> be a scandal!
Besides, you heard him say the bishop
could not help him,” said the
old lady.</p>

<p>“What a blessed thing it is to
be a Catholic!” exclaimed Franceline,
laughing. “<em>We</em> have no farmers’
boys or anybody else meddling
with our priests; but then we
have the Pope, who settles everything,
and everybody submits.
You ought to invite the Pope to
come over and deliver you from all
your troubles!”</p>

<p class="break">The table was spread on the
grass-plot in front of the cottage.
Franceline had made it pretty with
ferns and flowers, and then sat
down under the porch, in her white
muslin dress and pink sash, to converse
with her doves while waiting
for Sir Simon and his two friends.
Her doves were great company to
her; she had been so used to talking
to them ever since she was a
child, complaining to them of her
small griefs and telling them of her
little joys, that she came to fancy
they understood her, and took
their plaintive coo or their little
crystal laughter as an intelligible
and sympathetic response. One of
the soft-breasted, opal-winged little
messengers is upon her finger now,
clutching the soft white perch
sharply enough with its coral claws,
and answering her caresses with
that low, inarticulate sighing that
sounds like the yearning of an imprisoned
spirit. Franceline took
some seed out of a box on the window-sill
beside her, and began to
feed it out of her hand, watching
the little, pearly head bobbing on
her palm with a smile of tenderest
approval. At the sound of footsteps
crunching the gravel at the
back of the cottage she rose, still
feeding her dove, to go and meet
the gentlemen. But there was only
one.</p>

<p>“I fear I am before my time,”
said Mr. de Winton, “but I expected
to find the others here before
me.” (O Clide, Clide! what prevarication
is this?) “They went out
about half an hour ago, and told
me to meet them in the Beech walk,
where we were to come on together.
Have I come too soon?”</p>

<p>“Oh! not at all,” said the young
girl graciously; “my father will
come out in a moment, and I am
not very busy, as you see!”</p>

<p>“You are fond of animals, I perceive.”</p>

<p>“Animals! Oh! don’t call my
sweet little doves animals,” retorted
Franceline indignantly. “That’s
worse than papa. When they coo
too much and disturb him, and I take
their part, he always says: ‘Oh!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
I’m fond of the birds, but they are
noisy little things’! The idea of
speaking of them as ‘the birds’! It
hurts my feelings very much.”</p>

<p>“Then pray instruct me, so that I
may not have the misfortune to do
so too!” entreated Clide. “Tell me
by what name I must call them.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you may laugh. I am
used to being laughed at about my
doves; I don’t mind it,” said Franceline
with a pretty toss of her
small, haughty head.</p>

<p>“I am not laughing at you; I
should be very sorry to call anything
you loved by a name that
hurt you,” protested the young
man with a warmth that made Franceline
look up from her dove at
him; the fervor of the glance that
met her did not cause her to avert
her eyes, and brought no glow over
her face. Three of the doves
came flying down from the medlar-tree,
scattering the starry-white
blossoms in their flight. After making
a few circles in the air, one
perched on Franceline’s shoulder,
and two alighted on her head.
Clide thought it was the prettiest
picture he had ever seen; and as
he watched the soft little creatures
nestling into the copper-colored
hair, he wondered if this choice of
a nest did not betray a little cunning,
mingled with their native
simplicity. But Franceline could
not see the performance from this
picturesque point of view. The
two on her head were fighting,
each trying to push the other off.
She put up her hand to chase them
away, but the claws of one got entangled
in her hair, and the more
it struggled, the more difficult it
became to escape. Clide could not
but come to her assistance; he
disengaged the tenacious rose-leaves
very deftly from the glossy meshes,
and set the prisoner free.</p>

<p>“Naughty little bird!” said
Franceline, shaking back her flushed
face, and smoothing the slightly-dishevelled
braids; and then, without
a word of thanks to her deliverer,
or otherwise alluding to the misconduct
of her pets, she walked
on towards the summer-house, and
broke out into observations about
the beauties of the neighborhood,
asking her companion what he had
seen and how he liked the country
round Dullerton. She spoke English
as fluently as a native, with
only a slight foreign accentuation
of the vowels that was too piquant
to be a blemish; but every now and
then a literal translation reminded
you unmistakably that the speaker
was a foreigner.</p>

<p>Clide thought the accent and the
Gallicisms quite charming; he was,
however, a little startled when the
young lady, in pointing out the
various places of the surrounding
parts, and telling him who owned
them, informed him very gravely
that the pretty Mrs. Lawrence, who
lived in that Elizabethan house
with a clock-tower rising behind
the wood, was thirty years younger
than her rich husband, and had
married him for his “propriety,” as
she was very poor and had none
of her own.</p>

<p>Franceline noticed the undisguised
astonishment caused by this
announcement, and, blushing up
with a little vexation, exclaimed:
“I mean for his property! You
know in French <i lang="fr">propriété</i> means property.”
But after this she insisted
on talking French. Clide protested
he liked English much better, and
vowed that she spoke it in perfection;
but it was no use.</p>

<p>“English is too serious for conversation,
and too stiff,” said Franceline,
revenging herself for her
blunder on the innocent medium of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
it, as we are all apt to do. “It is
only fit for sermons and speeches.
In French you can talk for an hour
without saying anything, and it
doesn’t matter. French is like a
light, airy little carriage that only
wants a touch to send it spinning
along, and, once going, it will go on
for ever; but English is a stagecoach,
stately and top-heavy, and
won’t go without passengers to
steady it and horses to draw it.
Foolish thoughts always sound so
much more foolish in English than
in French. People who are not
serious and wise should always
talk French.”</p>

<p>“Ah! merci, now I see why you
insist on my talking it,” said Clide,
laughing.</p>

<p>“It would have been a rash
judgment; I could not tell whether
you were wise or not.”</p>

<p>“I dare say you are right, though
it never occurred to me before,”
he remarked deprecatingly. “Our
robust Anglo-Saxon is rather a
clumsy vehicle for conversation
compared with yours.”</p>

<p>“I did not call it clumsy; I said
stately,” corrected Franceline.</p>

<p>Clide began to fear he was making
himself disagreeable; that she
was taking a dislike to him. Happily,
before he committed himself
further, M. de la Bourbonais came
out and joined them. He was soon
followed by Sir Simon and the admiral,
and the little party sat down
to Angélique’s <i lang="fr">chefs-d’œuvre</i> under
the shade of the medlar-tree, with
the doves sounding their bugle in
the adjoining copse. The sun was
setting, and sent a stream of orange
and rose colored light into the garden
and over the group at the table;
a breeze came up from the river,
fluttering the strawberry leaves and
Franceline’s hair, and blowing the
heavy scent of new-mown hay into
her face. It happened&mdash;of course
by chance, unless that far-sighted
old Angélique had a hand in it&mdash;that
Clide was seated next to her;
and as the leg of the long table
made a space between her and Sir
Simon, it was natural that the two
young people should be thrown on
their own resources for conversation,
while their elders at the other
end talked incessantly of old times
and people that neither Clide nor
Franceline cared about. It was
the first time in her life that she
found herself the object of direct
homage and attention from a
young yet mature man, and the
experience was decidedly pleasant.
Clide was determined to efface the
bad impression that he imagined he
had made, and to win Franceline’s
good graces or die in the effort. It
was not a very difficult task, and
the zest with which he set about it
proved that it was not a disagreeable
one. He bent all the energies of
his mind to the sole end of interesting
and entertaining her, and
soon the undisguised pleasure that
shone in the listener’s face showed
that he was succeeding. With that instinct
which quickens the perception
of young gentlemen in Clide de Winton’s
present state of mind, he was
not long in hitting upon the subjects
that most excited her curiosity.
She had never been beyond
the woods of Dullerton since she
was of an age to observe things, and
it was like a flight in a balloon over
all these far-off countries to be carried
there in imagination by the
vivid descriptions of one who had
seen them all. Clide began to
wonder at himself as he went on;
he had never suspected himself of
such brilliant conversational powers
as he was now displaying. He was
surprised to see how much the
dreamy, dark eyes had read about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
the various countries he spoke of,
and what an enlightened interest
she took in the natural history of
each. She wanted to know a great
deal about the splendid tropical
birds that have no voices, and
about the albatross and other marvellous
inhabitants of the skies in
far-away lands; and Clide lent himself
with the utmost condescension
to her catechising. But when he
came to talking of Rome and the
Catacombs, the eyes kindled with a
different sort of interest.</p>

<p>“And you saw the very spot
where S. Cecilia was buried, and
S. Agatha, and S. Agnes, who was
only thirteen when she was martyred?
Oh! how I envy you. I would
walk all the way barefooted from
this to see those sacred places.
And the Colosseum, where the wild
beasts tore the martyrs to pieces!”
She clasped her hands and looked
at him with the look of awe and
wonder that we might bestow on
some one who had seen a vision.
“And the tombs of the apostles, and
the prison where S. Peter was when
the angel came and set him free?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw them all; it was a
great privilege,” said Clide, conscious
of realizing for the first time
how great.</p>

<p>“Indeed it was!” murmured
Franceline, as if speaking to herself;
then suddenly looking up at
him, “Did it not make you long to
be a martyr?”</p>

<p>Clide hesitated. The temptation
to answer “yes” was very strong.
The dark, appealing eyes were fixed
on him with an expression that it
was dreadful to disappoint; but he
was too honest and too proud to
steal her approval under false
colors.</p>

<p>“No, I am afraid I did not. I
saw it all too much from the historical
point of view. The triumphs
of the Christian heroes were mixed
up in my memory with too many
classical associations; and even if it
had not been so, I confess that the
phase of martyrdom recalled by the
Colosseum and the Catacombs is
not the one to stir my slow heroic
pulses. There is too much of the
ghastly physical strife on the one
hand, and of wanton cruelty on the
other; the contemplation rather
shocks and harrows than stimulates
me. I did once feel something like
what you describe, but it was not
in Rome.”</p>

<p>“Where was it?” inquired Franceline
eagerly.</p>

<p>“It was in Africa, amongst a
tribe of savages. I remember feeling
it would be a grand use of a
man’s life to devote it to rescuing
them from their deplorable state of
mental darkness and physical degradation;
and that if one died in the
struggle, like Francis Xavier, an outcast
on the sea-shore, forsaken by
every visible helpmate, it would be
as noble a death as a man could
wish to die.”</p>

<p>“I wonder you did not follow
the impulse,” said Franceline.
“You might have converted thousands
of those poor savages, and
been a second S. Francis Xavier.
It must have been a great struggle
not to try it.”</p>

<p>Clide did not laugh, but went on
gravely dipping his strawberries into
sugar for a moment, and then
said:</p>

<p>“No, I can’t pretend even to the
negative glory of a struggle. I am
ashamed to say the desire was a
mere transient caprice. I got the
length of spending ten days learning
the language, and by that time
the dirt and stupidity and cruelty
of the neophytes had done for my
apostolic vocation; the debased
condition of the poor creatures was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
brought home to me so fearfully
that I gave it up in disgust. I dare
say it was very cowardly, very
selfish; but, looking back on it, I
can’t help feeling that the savages
had no great loss. It takes more
than an impulse of emotional pity
to make a hero of the Francis
Xavier type; one can’t be an apostle
by mere willing and wishing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but one can,” denied Franceline;
“that is just the one kind
of hero that it only wants will to
be. One cannot be a warrior or a
poet, or that kind of thing, because
that requires genius; but one may
be a martyr or an apostle simply by
willing. Love is the only genius that
one wants; it was love that turned
the twelve fishermen into apostles
and heroes, you know.”</p>

<p>“Just so; but I didn’t love the
savages.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you would if you had
tried.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it is possible to
love any one by trying?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know; if they
were very unhappy and wanted my
love very much, I think I might.”</p>

<p>Clide stole a quick glance at her;
but Franceline was peeling a pear,
and evidently an undue portion of
her thoughts were concentrated on
that operation and a care not to let
the juice run on her fingers. “Then
you think it was very wicked of me
not to have loved those savages?”
he began again.</p>

<p>“I don’t say it was wicked. If
they were so very dirty and cruel, it
must have been hard enough; but
you might have found another tribe
that would have been more lovable,
and that wanted quite as much
to be civilized and converted&mdash;nice,
simple savages, like wild flowers or
dumb animals, that would have
been docile and grateful, perhaps
revengeful too; but then when they
were Christians they would have
conquered that&mdash;”</p>

<p>Clide laughed outright.</p>

<p>“I don’t think your vocation for
converting the savages is so very
much superior to mine,” he said;
“it certainly would not have lived
through my three days’ novitiate.”</p>

<p>Franceline looked at him, and
laughed too&mdash;that clear, ringing
laugh of hers, that was so contagious;
they both felt very young together.</p>

<p>“And what was your next vocation?”
she asked, perfectly unconscious
of any indiscretion. “What
are you going to do now?”</p>

<p>“This morning my mind was
made up to go abroad again in a
few days, and recommence my old
life of busy idleness; but your father
has upset all my plans.”</p>

<p>“My father!”</p>

<p>“Yes. It ought not to surprise
you much; it is not likely to be the
first time that M. de la Bourbonais
has proved the good genius of another.
He was kind enough to let
me talk to him of myself, and to
give my folly the benefit of his wisdom;
he made me feel that I was
leading a very selfish, good-for-nothing
sort of life, and showed me
how wrong it was; in fact, he did
for me what I wanted to do for the
savages. He taught me what my
duty was, and I promised him I
would try to do it.”</p>

<p>“Ah! then perhaps you are going
to be a hero after all,” said
Franceline, a gleam of enthusiasm
sparkling in her face again.</p>

<p>“I fear not; at least, it will be a
very prosaic, humdrum sort of heroism.
I am going to stay at home,
and try to be useful to a few people
in a quiet way on my own property.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I am so glad. Then we
shall see you again. You’ll be sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
to come and see Sir Simon sometimes,
will you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will come in any case to
see M. de la Bourbonais,” said
Clide. “His advice will be invaluable
to me; and he was so kind as to
promise that he would always be
glad to give it to me.”</p>

<p>The sweet dimples broke out
with a blush of pleasure and pride
in Franceline’s face; it was a delight
to her to hear any one speak
so of her father, and Clide had seen
so many wise and clever people in
his travels that his admiration and
respect implied a great deal. If
the young man had been a Talleyrand
bent on attaining some diplomatic
end, he could not have displayed
greater cunning and tact.</p>

<p>“It’s a great come down from
the grand African scheme, you see,”
he observed, laughing; “but under
such good guidance there is no saying
what I may not achieve. I may
turn out a hero in the end.”</p>

<p>“If you do your duty perfectly,
of course you will,” replied Franceline
confidently. “Papa says the
real heroes are those that do their
duty best and get no praise for it.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but I should like a little
praise; you would not grudge me
a little now and then if I deserved
it?” And the look that accompanied
the question would have most
fully explained the praise he coveted,
if Franceline had not been as
unlearned in that species of language
as one of her doves.</p>

<p>“Bless me! how beautiful that
child is!” said the admiral in a
<i lang="it">sotto voce</i>. “Just look at her color;
did you ever see anything to come
up to it? It reminds me of that
tinted Hebe that we went to see together
in Florence; you remember,
Harness?”</p>

<p>The excitement of talking had
brought an exquisite pink glow into
Franceline’s cheeks, and made her
eyes sparkle with unwonted brilliancy.
Her father listened to the
flattering outburst of the old sailor
with a bright smile of satisfaction,
not venturing to look at Franceline,
lest he should betray his acquiescence
too palpably.</p>

<p>“And she’s the very picture of
health too!” remarked the admiral.</p>

<p>At this Raymond turned and
looked at her.</p>

<p>“How like her mother she is!”
said Sir Simon, appealing to him;
but he had no sooner uttered the
words than he wished himself silent.
The smile died immediately out of
M. de la Bourbonais’ face, and a
sharp spasm of pain passed over it
like a shadow. Sir Simon guessed
at once what caused it: the bright
and delicate color, that the admiral
had aptly compared to the transparency
of tinted marble, reminded
him of Armengarde when death
had cast its terrible beauty over
her.</p>

<p>“Like her in beauty and in many
other things,” resumed the baronet
in a careless, abstracted tone. “But,
happily, Franceline does not know
what delicacy means; she has never
known a day’s illness in her life,
I believe.”</p>

<p>But this reassuring remark did
not bring back the smile into the
father’s face; he fixed his eyes on
Franceline with an uneasy glance,
as if looking for something that he
dreaded to see there.</p>

<p>“She must find this place dull,
pretty little pet,” observed the
admiral, who saw nothing to check
his admiring comments.</p>

<p>“It never occurred to me before,
but I dare say she does,” assented
the baronet; “and she’s old enough
now to want a little amusement. We
ought to have thought of that already,
Raymond; but we’re a selfish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
lot, the best of us. We forget that
we were young ourselves once upon
a time. I’ll tell you what it is, De
Winton, we’ll carry the child off
one of these days to London, and
show her the sights and take her to
the opera. You’d like that, Franceline,
would you not?” And shifting
his chair to the other side of
the table, he set himself down by
her side in an affectionate attitude.</p>

<p>The project was discussed with
great animation, Franceline being
evidently delighted with it.</p>

<p>“My step-mother was to be in
town next week,” said Clide, “and
I’m sure she would be very happy
to give her services as chaperon, if
you have not any more privileged
person in view.”</p>

<p>“That’s not a bad idea. I had
not thought of that. I’m glad you
mentioned it. I’ll write to her this
very night,” said Sir Simon. “Meantime,
it strikes me that it would be
a very good thing if you learned to
ride, Miss Franceline; it’s a disgrace
to us all to think of your having entered
your eighteenth year without
being taught this accomplishment.
We must set about repairing your
neglected education at once. How
about a pony, Clide? Which of the
nags would suit best, do you think?”</p>

<p>“I should say Rosebud would be
about the nicest you could find for
a lady; she’s as gentle as a lamb,
and as smooth-footed as a cat.”</p>

<p>“Rosebud!” echoed M. de La
Bourbonais. “Mon cher…”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think you’re right,” said
Sir Simon, completely ignoring the
interruption. “Rosebud is a gem
of a lady’s horse. We’ll have a few
private lessons in the park first, and
let her canter over the turf before
we show off in public.”</p>

<p>“Mon cher Simon,” broke in
Raymond again, “it cannot be
thought of. Franceline would not
like it; she does not care, I assure
you.…”</p>

<p>“O petit papa!” cried Franceline
with a little, entreating gesture.</p>

<p>“Ah! is it so indeed? But, my
child, consider…”</p>

<p>“Consider, Monsieur le Philosophe,
that you don’t understand the
matter at all; you just leave it to
us to settle, and attend to what De
Winton is saying to you.”</p>

<p>This last was a difficult injunction,
inasmuch as the admiral was
saying nothing. “Come along with
me out of the reach of busybodies,
Franceline,” he continued, and,
drawing her arm within his own, they
walked off to the summer-house,
where Clide, without being invited,
followed them. There was a long
and most interesting conference,
which terminated in Franceline’s
standing on tiptoe to be kissed by
her old friend, and declaring that it
was very naughty of him to spoil
her so.</p>

<p class="break">“Show him in,” said the vicar,
laying down his pen, and a stout,
rosy-cheeked, fair-haired young
man in corduroys and top-boots
was ushered into the study.</p>

<p>“Well Griggs, I’m glad to see
you. Sit down,” said Mr. Langrove
in the bland, familiar tone of kindness
that put simple folk at ease
with him directly. “You’ve come
to consult me on a matter of importance,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Of importance,” echoed the
farmer, twirling his round hat between
his knees and contemplating
his boots&mdash;“of great importance,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, let me hear what it is. If
I can help you in any way, you may
count upon me,” replied the vicar
encouragingly, drawing his chair a
little nearer.</p>

<p>“Thank you, I don’t want help,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
he said with a significant emphasis.
“I know where to look for it when
I do,” turning up his eyes sanctimoniously
to heaven.</p>

<p>“Certainly, that help is ever at
hand for us. But what is your business
with me?”</p>

<p>“You’ll not take it amiss if I
speak frankly, sir. We can none of
us do more than bear testimony to
the truth, according to our lights,”
explained the farmer; and, Mr. Langrove
having by a grave nod acceded
to this proposition, he resumed:
“You contradicted yourself
in the pulpit last Sunday. It’s
been repeated to me that you found
fault with my teaching concerning
faith and works; and so, for sake of
them as look to me for guidance, I
came up to hear what views you
held on that head, as the gospel of
the day said: ‘And every man shall
be judged according to his works.’
Now, sir, it appears to me the end
of the sermon was a flat contradiction
of the beginning.”</p>

<p>“Can you name the contradictory
passages?” demanded the vicar,
after an imperceptible start.</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t say as I can,” admitted
the farmer; “but I’d know
them if I heard them.”</p>

<p>Mr. Langrove rose, and took
down a large manuscript volume
from a shelf directly over his head.
Opening it at random, his eye fell
upon the text: “Learn of me, for I
am meek and humble of heart.” He
lingered on it for a second, then
turned over the leaves, and, having
found the place he wanted, he read
aloud the first and last few pages
of the preceding Sunday’s sermon.</p>

<p>“Where do you see the contradiction?”
he inquired, looking up
and laying his hand on the page.</p>

<p>“Well, as you read it now, I
can’t say it sounds much amiss,” replied
Mr. Griggs, lifting his feet and
bringing them down again with a
dubious thud. “I expect the fault
was in the way of saying it. You
don’t speak plain enough; if you
spoke plainer, folks would most
likely understand you better. Many
as have joined the Connection say
as it was that as drove them to us.
They couldn’t understand you; they
often came away puzzled.”</p>

<p>A transient flush rose and died
out in the vicar’s face, and his lips
trembled a little. But Farmer Griggs
did not notice this; he was looking
at his boots, and pondering on the
wisdom of his own words. Mr.
Langrove had been pretty well
trained to forbearance of late years,
and, though he was too humble-minded
and too honest to pretend
to be indifferent to the humiliating
interference he had to suffer, he
was surprised to find how keenly
he smarted under the present one,
and mortified to feel how alive the
old man was in him, in spite of the
many blows he had dealt him. He
never, since he was a school-boy,
was conscious of such a strong desire
to kick a fellow-creature; and
this rising movement was no
sooner strangled by an imperious
effort of self-control than it rose
up instantaneously in the milder
form of an impulse to open the door
and show his visitor out. Before
this second rebellion of the old
man was put down, Farmer Griggs,
mistaking the vicar’s momentary
silence for a tacit acknowledgment
of his shortcomings, observed:</p>

<p>“It’s a solemn thing to break the
word; and the plainer and simpler
one speaks the better it is for those
that hear it, though it mayn’t be
such a credit for them that speak
it. There’s them that say you think
more about making a fine sermon
than doing good to souls&mdash;which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
no better than spiritual pride. You
can’t shut folks’ mouths, no more
than you can stop the river from running;
they will say what they think.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and that is why we are
commanded to think no evil,” rejoined
the vicar. “We are too ready
to judge of other people’s motives,
when in all conscience we are hard
set enough to judge our own. If
we go to church to pick holes in
the sermon, as you say, we had better
stay away. The preacher may
be a very poor one, but, trust me,
while he does his best, those who
listen in the right spirit will learn
no harm from him; those who have
not that spirit would do well to ask
for it, and meantime to study the
chapter of S. James on the use of
the tongue.”</p>

<p>The vicar rose, as if to intimate
that the audience was at an end.</p>

<p>“Well, there may be something
in that,” remarked the farmer, rising
slowly; “but, for my own part,
I never had much opinion of James.
Paul is the man; if it hadn’t been
for Paul, it’s my belief the whole
concern would have been a failure.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
Good-morning, sir.” And without
waiting to see the effect of this
startling announcement of his private
views, Farmer Griggs bowed
himself out.</p>

<p>“And these are the men who
take the word out of our mouths!
Did he come of his own accord, or
was he set on to it by Miss Bulpit?”
was the vicar’s reflection, as he
stood watching the farmer’s retreating
figure from the window. “It is
more than I can bear; some steps
must be taken. It’s high time for
Harness to interfere; it’s too bad
of him if he refuses.”</p>

<p>Mr. Langrove took up his hat,
and went straight to the Court.</p>

<p>“Depend upon it,” said Sir Simon
when the clergymen had related
the recent interview&mdash;“depend
upon it, Griggs is too shy a chap to
have done it on his own hook; take
my word for it, there is a woman
at the bottom of it.”</p>

<p>“That is just what makes it so
serious. Griggs is a poor, ignorant,
conceited fellow that one can’t feel
very angry with; one is more inclined
to laugh at him and pity him.
But it is altogether unpardonable in
such a person as Miss Bulpit; it’s
her being at the bottom of it that
makes the case hard on me.”</p>

<p>Sir Simon agreed that it was.</p>

<p>“Then what do you advise me
to do? What steps are you prepared
to take?” asked Mr. Langrove.</p>

<p>“My advice is that we leave her
alone,” replied Sir Simon. “We’re
none of us a match for womankind.
She circumvented me about that bit
of ground for the Methodist chapel.
She’s too many guns for both of us
together, Langrove; if you get into
a quarrel with the old lady, she’ll
raise the parish against you with
port wine and flannel shirts, and
you’ll go to the wall. After all,
why need you worry about it! Let
her have her say. They love to hear
themselves talk, women do; you
can’t change them, and you
wouldn’t if you could. Come, now,
Langrove, you know you wouldn’t.
Halloo! here’s something to look
at!” And he started from his semi-recumbent
attitude in the luxurious
arm-chair, and went to the open
window. It was a charming sight
that met them. Two riders, a lady
and a gentleman, were cantering
over the sward on two magnificent
horses, a bay and a black.</p>

<p>“Is that Franceline?” exclaimed
Mr. Langrove, forgetting, in his
surprise and admiration, the annoyance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
of having his grievance pooh-poohed
so unconcernedly.</p>

<p>“Yes. How capitally the little
thing holds herself! She only had
three lessons, and she sits in her
saddle as if it were a chair. Let’s
come out and have a look at
them!”</p>

<p>They stepped on the terrace.
But Clide and Franceline were lost
to view for a few minutes in the
avenue; presently they emerged
from the trees and came cantering
up the lawn, Franceline’s laugh
sounding as merry as a hunting-horn
through the park.</p>

<p>“Bravo! Capital! We’ll make a
first-rate horse-woman of her by-and-by.
She’ll cut out every girl in
the county one of these days. And
pray who gave you leave to assume
the duties of riding-master without
consulting me, sir?”</p>

<p>This was to Clide, who had
sprung off his horse to set something
right in his pupil’s saddle and
adjust the folds of her habit, which
had nothing amiss that any one else
could see.</p>

<p>“They told me you were engaged,
so I did not like to disturb
you,” he explained.</p>

<p>“I should very much like to
know who told you so,” said Sir
Simon, with offensive incredulity.</p>

<p>“My respected uncle is the offender,
if offence there be; but now
that you are disengaged, perhaps
you would like to take a canter
with us. I’ll go round and order
your horse?”</p>

<p>“No, you sha’n’t. I don’t choose
to be taken up second-hand in that
fashion; you’ll be good enough to
walk off to The Lilies, and tell the
count I have something very particular
to say to him, and I’ll take it
as a favor if he’ll come up at once.”</p>

<p>Clide turned his horse’s head in
the direction indicated.</p>

<p>“No, no; you’ll get down and
walk there,” said Sir Simon. “If
he sees you on horseback, he
may suspect something, and that
would spoil the fun.” The young
man alighted, and gave his bridle
to be held.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why I shouldn’t
hold it in the saddle,” said the
baronet after a moment; “and we
will take a turn while we’re waiting.”
He vaulted into Clide’s vacant
seat with the agility of a younger
man.</p>

<p>“Well, a pleasant ride to you
both!” said Mr. Langrove, moving
away. “You do your master credit,
Franceline, whoever he is; and the
exercise has given you a fine color
too,” he added, nodding kindly to
her.</p>

<p>“Oh! it’s enchanting!” cried the
young Amazon passionately. “I
feel as if I had wings; and Rosebud
is so gentle!”</p>

<p>“Look here, Langrove,” called
out Sir Simon, backing his powerful
black horse, and stooping towards
the vicar, “don’t you go
worrying yourself about this business;
it’s not worth it. They are a
parcel of humbugs, the whole lot of
them. I know Griggs well&mdash;a hot-headed,
canting lout that would be
much better occupied attending to
his pigs. It would never do for a
man like you to come into collision
with him. Let those that like his
fire and brimstone go and take it;
you’ve a good riddance of them.
And as to the old lady, keep never
minding. You’ll do no good by
crossing her; she’s a harmless old
party as long as you let her have
her own way, but if you rouse her
there will be the devil to pay.”</p>

<p>M. de la Bourbonais had been
kept out of the secret of the riding
lessons. He had heard nothing
more of the scheme since that evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
at supper, and, with Angélique
in the plot, it required no great
diplomacy to manage the trying on
of the riding habit, that had been
made by the first lady’s dressmaker
in London, brought down for the
purpose; so that the intended surprise
was as complete as Sir Simon
and his accomplices could have
wished.</p>

<p>“Comment donc!”<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> he exclaimed,
breaking out into French, as
usual when he was excited. “What
is this? What do I see? My Clair
de lune<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> turned into an Amazon!”
And he stood at the end of the lawn
and beheld Franceline careering on
her beautiful, thoroughbred pony.
“Ah! Simon, Simon, this is too
bad. This is terrible!” he protested,
as the baronet rode up; but
the smile of inexpressible pleasure
that shone in his face took all the
reproach out of the words.</p>

<p>“Look at her!” cried Sir Simon
triumphantly; “did you ever see
any one take to it so quickly? Just
see how she sits in her saddle.
Stand out of the way a bit, till we
have another gallop. Now, Franceline,
who’ll be back first?”</p>

<p>And away they flew, Sir Simon
reining in his more powerful steed,
so as to let Rosebud come in a
neck ahead of him.</p>

<p>“Simon, Simon, you are incorrigible!
I don’t know what to say
to you,” said Raymond, settling
and unsettling the spectacles under
his bushy eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Compliment me; that’s all
you need say for the present,” said
Sir Simon. “See what a color I’ve
brought into her cheeks!”</p>

<p>“O petit père! it is so delightful,”
exclaimed Franceline, caressing
the hand her father had laid on
Rosebud’s neck. “I never enjoyed
anything so much. And I’m not
the least fatigued; you know you
were afraid it would fatigue me?
And is not Rosebud a beauty?
And look at my whip.” And she
turned the elegant gold-headed handle
for his inspection.</p>

<p>“Mounted in gold, and with your
cipher in turquoise! Ah! you are
nicely spoiled! Simon, Simon!”
What more could he say at such a
moment? It would have been odious
to show anything but gratitude
and pleasure, even if he felt it. This,
then, was the end of the earnest
midnight conference, and the distinct
promise that Rosebud and
Nero should be sold! The animal
that would have paid half a lawful
and urgent debt was to be kept for
Franceline, and he must sanction
the folly; to say nothing of the rigging
out of that young lady in a
complete riding suit of the most expensive
fashion. Well, well, it was
no use protesting now, and it was
impossible to deny that the exquisitely-fitting
habit and the dark beaver
hat set off her figure and hair in
singular perfection. The bright,
healthy glow of her cheeks, too
pleaded irresistibly in extenuation
of Sir Simon’s extravagance.</p>

<p>“Shall we ride down to The Lilies?
I should like Angélique to see
me. She would be so pleased,” said
Franceline, appealing to Sir Simon.</p>

<p>“You think she would? Silly
old woman! very likely; but I want
to have a talk with your father, so
Clide must go and take care of
you.” And the baronet slipped off
his horse, which Mr. de Winton,
with exemplary docility, at once
mounted. The two young people
set off at a canter, Franceline turning
round to kiss her hand to her
father, as they plunged into the
trees and were lost to sight.</p>

<p>It would be useless to attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
describe the effect of the apparition
on Angélique: how she threw up
her hands, and then flattened them
between her knees, calling all the
saints in Paradise to witness if any
one had ever seen the like; and how
nothing would satisfy her but that
they should gallop up and down the
field in front for her edification; and
the astonishment of a flock of sheep
which the performance sent scampering
and bleating in wild dismay
backwards and forwards along with
them; and how, when Franceline’s
hair came undone in the galloping,
and fell in a golden shower down
her back, the old woman declared
it was the very image of S. Michael
on horseback, whom she had seen
trampling down the dragon in an
Assyrian church. When it was all
over, and Franceline had gone upstairs
to change her dress, Clide
tied the horses to a tree, and completed
his conquest of the old lady
by asking her to show him that
wonderful casket he had heard so
much about. She produced it from
its hiding-place in M. de la Bourbonais’
room, and, reverently unwrapping
it, proceeded to tell the
story of how the papers had been
rescued, and how they had been
burned, watching her listener’s face
with keen eyes all the while, to see
if any shadow of scepticism was to
be detected in it; but Clide was all
attention and faith. “There are
people who think it clever to laugh
at the family for believing in such a
story,” she observed; “but, as I say,
when a thing has come down from
father to son for nigh four thousand
years, it’s hard not to believe in it;
and to my mind it’s easier to believe
it than to think anybody could
have had the wit to invent it.” And
Clide having agreed that no mere
human imagination could ever indeed
have reached so lofty a flight,
Angélique called his attention to
the ornamentation of the casket.
“Monsieur can see how unlike anything
in our times it is,” pointing
to the antediluvian vipers crawling
and writhing in the rusty iron;
“and all that is typical&mdash;the snakes and
the birds and the crooked signs&mdash;everything
is typical, as Monsieur
le Comte will tell you.”</p>

<p>“And what is it supposed to typify?”
asked Clide, anxious to seem
interested.</p>

<p>“Ah! I know nothing about that,
monsieur!” replied Angélique with
a shrug; and lest other questions
of an equally indiscreet and unreasonable
nature should follow,
she covered up the casket and carried
it off.</p>

<h3>“CHIEFLY AMONG WOMEN.”</h3>

<p class="center">BY AN AMERICAN WOMAN.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone, in his <cite>Political
Expostulation</cite>, makes use of the following
expression in regard to the
growth of the Catholic Church in
England: “The conquests have
been chiefly, as might have been
expected, among women.” That
the ex-premier intended this as a
statement of fact rather than a
sneer is very probable; for he evidently
endeavors to employ the language
of good manners in his controversies,
unlike his predecessors
in polemics during the XVIIth and
XVIIIth centuries. The debate
between him and his distinguished
antagonists in the English hierarchy
bears, happily, little resemblance to
that between John Milton and Salmasius
concerning the royal rights
of Charles I. But that, nevertheless,
there is a sneer in the quoted
expression is scarcely to be denied;
and that this sneer had a lodgment
in Mr. Gladstone’s mind, and escaped
thence by a sort of mental
wink, if not by his will, is beyond
doubt. The pamphlet bears all
the internal as well as external
marks of haste; it is only a piece
of clever “journalism”&mdash;written for
a day, overturned in a day. “Mr.
Gladstone lighted a fire on Saturday
night which was put out on
Monday morning,” said the London
<cite>Tablet</cite>. But the sneer, whether
wilful or not, stands, and cannot be
erased or ignored; and it is worth
more than a passing consideration.
It is an indirect and ungraceful way
of saying that the Catholic Church
brings conviction more readily to
weaker than to stronger intellects;
and that because the “conquests”
are “chiefly among women,” the
progress of the church among the
people is not substantial, general, or
permanent. We presume that this
is a reasonable construction of the
expression.</p>

<p>Whether the first of these propositions
be true or not is not pertinent
to the practical question contained
in the second. We will only
remark, in passing it over, that
there stands against its verity a
formidable list of giant male intellects
for which Protestantism and
infidelity have failed to furnish a
corresponding offset. Students of
science and literature and lovers of
art will not need to be reminded of
the names. That Catholic doctrine
is intellectual in the purest and best
sense there are the records of nineteen
centuries of civilization and
letters to offer in evidence. But
what Mr. Gladstone invites us to
discuss is the power of women in
propagating religion. In arriving
at a correct estimate we must review,
with what minuteness the limits
of an article will permit, the part
that women have had in the establishment
of religion, the intensity,
the earnestness, the zeal, the persistence&mdash;for
these enter largely into
the idea of propagation&mdash;with which
women have accepted and followed
the teaching of the church, and the
ability they have exhibited and the
success they have achieved in the
impression of their convictions upon
others. We must take into account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
the relative natural zealousness
of the sexes; for zeal, next to
grace, has most to do with the making
of “conquests.” We must remember
the almost invincible weapon
which nature has placed in the
hands of the weaker sex for approaching
and controlling men; the
beautiful weapon&mdash;affection&mdash;which
mother, wife, sister, daughter, wield,
and for which very few men know of
any foil, or against which they would
raise one if they did. If we admit,
to conciliate Mr. Gladstone, that religion
is an affair of the heart as well
as of the head, he will be gracious
enough in return, we apprehend, to
concede that women must be potential
agents in its propagation.</p>

<p>Surely, it is only thoughtlessness
which enables well-read men to
assign to women an insignificant
place in the establishment of religion,
or their reading must have
been too much on their own side
of the line. Even the pagans were
wiser. They recognized the potency
of women with an intelligence born
of nothing less correct than instinct.
Their mythological Titans were
equally divided as to sex. A woman
was their model of the austerest
of virtues&mdash;perpetual celibacy.
A woman was their goddess of wisdom,
and, as opposed to man, the
patroness of just and humane warfare.
A woman presided over their
grain and harvests. Every Grecian
city maintained sacred fire on an
altar dedicated to Vesta, the protectress
of the dearest form of human
happiness&mdash;the domestic. It
was from Hebe the gods accepted
their nectar. The nine tutelary
deities of the æsthetic&mdash;the Muses&mdash;were
women. So were the Fates&mdash;who
held the distaff, and spun the
thread of life, and cut the thread&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Clotho and Lachesis, whose boundless sway,</div>
<div class="verse">With Atropos, both men and gods obey.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Splendor, Joy, and Pleasure were
the Graces. It was a woman who
first set the example of parental devotion&mdash;Rhea
concealing from their
would-be destroyers the birth of
Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto. It
was a woman who first set the example
of conjugal fidelity&mdash;Alcestis
offering to die for Admetus. It was
from a woman’s name, Alcyone,
we have our “halcyon days”&mdash;Alcyone,
who, overcome by grief for
her husband, lost at sea, threw herself
into the waves, and the gods, to
reward their mutual love, transformed
them into kingfishers; and when
they built their nests, the sea is
said to have been peaceful in order
not to disturb their joys. It was a
woman who dared to defy a king in
order to perform funeral rites over
the remains of her brother. It was
a woman, Ariadne, who, to save her
lover, Theseus, furnished him the
clew out of the Cretan labyrinth,
although she abolished thereby the
tribute her father was wont to extort
from the Athenians. In all
that was good, beautiful, and tender,
the pagans held women pre-eminent;
and whether we agree with
the earliest Greeks, who believed
their mythology fact; or with the
philosophers of the time of Euripides,
who identified the legends with
physical nature; or prefer to accept
the still later theory that the deities
and heroes were originally human,
and the marvellous myths terrestrial
occurrences idealized, the
eminence of the position accorded
to women is equally significant.
Woman was supremely influential,
especially in all that related to the
heart. She had her place beside
the priest. She was the most trusted
oracle. She watched the altar-fires.
She was worshipped in the
temples, and homage was paid to
her divinity in martial triumphs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
the public games. Whatever was
tender and beneficent in the mythical
dispensation was associated with
her sex. She was the goddess of
every kind of love. Excess, luxury,
brute-power, were typified by men
alone. The pagans knew that love
was the most potent influence to
which man was subject; and love
with them was but another name
for woman. “It is in the heart,”
says Lamartine, “that God has
placed the genius of women, because
the works of this genius are
all works of love.” Plautus, the
pagan satirist, offered his weight in
gold for a man who could reason
against woman’s influence. Emerson,
a very good pagan in his way,
appreciates the subtlety, the directness,
and the impervious character
of such an influence in the making
of conquests. “We say love is
blind,” he writes, “and the figure
of Cupid is drawn with a bandage
around his eyes&mdash;blind, because
he does not see what he does not
like; but the sharpest-sighted hunter
in the universe is Love, for finding
what he seeks, and only that.”</p>

<p>Woman holds a very prominent
place in the religious history of the
Jews. Two books of the Old Testament
were written in her exaltation&mdash;the
Book of Ruth and the
Book of Esther&mdash;while in the others
she is found constantly at the side
of man, exercising in religious affairs
a recognized power. Patriarchs
acknowledge her influence; she is
addressed by the prophets. It was
Anna who departed not from the
Temple, but served God with fastings
and prayers night and day. It was
to a mother’s prayers that Samuel
was granted. Sarah is honored by
mention in the New Testament as
a model spouse, and the church has
enshrined her name and her virtues
in the universal marriage service.
Miriam directed the triumphant
processions and inspired the hosannas
of the women of Israel, and
was their instructress and guide.
As it was then, as now, the custom
of the Israelites to separate the
men from the women in public
worship, Miriam was looked up to
as the appointed prophetess of her
time. Micah, the prophet, speaking
in the name of God, says to the
Jews: “I brought thee up out of
the land of Egypt, and I sent before
thee Moses and Aaron and
Miriam.” That she had been appointed
by the Lord, conjointly
with her brothers, to rescue her
people from servitude, appears from
her own words in Numbers: “Hath
the Lord indeed spoken only by
Moses? Hath he not spoken also by
us?” It is needless to allude to
the esteem in which Naomi and
Ruth were held. The widow of
Sarepta fed the prophet Elijah
when she had reason to believe that
in so doing she would expose her
son and herself to death by famine.
The Second Epistle of S. John was
written to a woman. The reverence
and affection with which the
writers in the New Testament
speak of the Blessed Virgin Mary
are too familiar for more than allusion.
The women who followed
Our Lord were singularly heroic,
and the influence which they exerted
upon their associates and upon
all who came in contact with them
must have been correspondingly
strong. Woman never insulted,
denied, or betrayed Christ:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Not she with trait’rous kiss her Saviour stung,</div>
<div class="verse">Not she denied him with unholy tongue;</div>
<div class="verse">She, while apostles shrank, could danger brave&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Last at his cross, and earliest at his grave.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>S. Paul himself commends the
women who labored with him in
spreading the Gospel. It was Lois
and Eunice who taught the Scriptures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
to Timothy. It was in response
to the appeals of women
that many of the greatest miracles
were wrought; Elijah and Elisha
both raised the dead to life at the
request of women; and Lazarus
was restored by Our Lord in pity
for his sisters. It was to a woman
our Lord spoke the blessed words,
“Thy sins be forgiven thee; go in
peace.” It was a woman whose
faith led her to touch the hem of
his garment, confident that thereby
she would be made whole. It was
a woman whom he singled out as
the object of his divine love on the
Sabbath day, in spite of the malicious
remonstrances of the Jews.
Almost his last words on the cross
had a woman for their subject. It
was women who followed him with
most unflagging devotion; and it was
women whom he first greeted after
his resurrection.</p>

<p>We come now to women in the
church militant. The question is
no longer, What have women been
in religion? but, What have they
done? Does the record which
they have made for themselves in
the propagation of Christianity justify
the sneer of the ex-premier?
The implication in Mr. Gladstone’s
quoted sentence is that, because
the church in England has found
her conquests thus far “chiefly
among women,” the Catholic faith
is not making such progress in that
country as should create apprehension.
He thus raises the issue of
woman’s potentiality in religion.</p>

<p>We venture to suggest that there
is no department of human endeavor
in which she is so powerful.</p>

<p>Woman’s power in the present
and the future, as a working disciple
of Our Lord, is reasonably deducible
from her past. We may not
argue that to-morrow she shall be
able to bring others to the knowledge
and service of God, if, throughout
the long yesterday of the
church, she was indifferent or imbecile.
She has little promise if she
has not already shown large fulfilment.
We may not look to her
zeal at the domestic hearth and in
cultivated society for fruits worthy
an apostle, if, in the crimson ages
of Christianity, her sex made no
sacrifices, achieved no glory. We
may doubt the strength of her intellect,
as applied to the science
of religion, if the past furnishes no
testimony thereof; and we may accept,
with some indulgence towards
its author, the ex-premier’s sneer
upon her efficiency in the active
toil of the church, if, in the past,
she has not been alert and successful
in its various forms of organized
intelligence, humanity, and benevolence.</p>

<p>What, then, are the facts? Did
women, in the early days, submit to
torture and death, side by side with
men, rather than deny their faith in
Christ? Was their faith, too, sealed
with their blood? Did women
share the labor and the danger of
teaching the truths of religion?
Did they, when such study was extremely
difficult, and required more
intellect because it enjoyed fewer
aids than now, devote themselves to
the investigation and elaboration
of sacred subjects? Have they contributed
anything to the learning
and literature of the church? Have
they gone into uncivilized countries
as missionaries? Have they furnished
conspicuous examples of
fidelity to God under circumstances
seductive or appalling? Have they
founded schools, established and
maintained houses for the sick, the
poor, the aged, the orphan, the
stranger? Have they crossed the
thresholds of their homes, never to
re-enter, but to follow whithersoever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
the Lord beckoned? Has
their zeal led them into the smoke
and rush of battle, into the dens of
pestilence, into squalor and the
haunts of crime? Have they proved
by evidence which will not be
disputed that, to win others to their
faith, they have given up everything&mdash;they
can give up everything&mdash;that
their faith is dearer to them
than all else on earth?</p>

<p>Then, surely, a faith which has
made its progress even “chiefly
among women” has made a progress
as solid as if it were chiefly
among men, for no greater things
can man do than these.</p>

<p>It is neither possible nor desirable,
in an article of narrow limits,
to enumerate the women who have
taken even a prominent part in
the establishment of Christianity
through the various agencies which
the church has employed. The
notice of each class must be brief,
and we shall not formally group
them; the testimony will be valid
enough, even in a cursory presentation.
What have women done to
prove their ability to propagate the
faith?</p>

<p>Beginning in the days of the
apostles, we find the blood of
women flowing as freely as that of
men in vindication of the Christian
creed. If men joyfully hastened to
the amphitheatre, so did they. If
men meekly accepted torture and
ignominy, so did they. If men defied
the ingenuity of cruelty and
smiled in their agony, so did they.
If men resigned human ambition,
surrendered possessions, and abandoned
luxury, so did they. The
annals of the martyrs show, with
what degree of accuracy it is difficult
now to determine, that if
either sex is entitled to higher distinction
for the abandonment of
everything that human nature holds
dear, in order to follow Christ even
to ignominious death, the pre-eminence
is in favor of the weaker sex.
It is impossible to read a chapter
of martyrology from the inauguration
of persecution until its close
without finding therein the names
of noble and gentle women illuminated
by their own blood.</p>

<p>Contemporaneous with S. Paul is
Thecla, who was held in so great
veneration in the early ages of
Christianity “that it was considered
the greatest praise that could be
given to a woman to compare her
with S. Thecla.” She was skilled
in profane and sacred science and
philosophy, and excelled in the various
branches of polite literature.
She is declared one of the brightest
ornaments of the apostolic age; and
one of the fathers “commends her
eloquence and the ease, strength,
sweetness, and modesty of her discourse.”
She was distinguished for
“the vehemence of her love for
Christ,” which she displayed on
many occasions with the courage
of a martyr and “with a strength
of body equal to the vigor of her
mind.” She was converted by S.
Paul about the year 45. Resolving
to dedicate her virginity and
life to God, she broke an engagement
of marriage, and, in despite
of the remonstrances of her parents
and the entreaties of her betrothed,
who was a pagan nobleman, devoted
herself to the work of the Gospel.
At length authority placed its
cruel hand upon her. She was exposed
naked in the amphitheatre;
but her fortitude survived the
shock undaunted. The lions forgot
their ferocity and licked her
feet; and S. Ambrose, S. Chrysostom,
S. Methodius, S. Gregory
Nazianzen, and other fathers confirm
the truth of the statement that
she emerged from the arena without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
harm. She was exposed to
many similar dangers, but triumphantly
survived them. She accompanied
S. Paul in many of his
journeys, and died in retirement
at Isaura. The great cathedral of
Milan was built in her honor.</p>

<p>Visitors to Rome are taken to the
Church of S. Prisca, built on the
original site of her house&mdash;the house
in which S. Peter lodged. Prisca
was a noble Roman lady who, on
account of her profession of Christianity,
was exposed in the amphitheatre
at the age of thirteen. The
lions refusing to devour her, she
was beheaded in prison. In the
IIId century we behold S. Agatha
displaying a fortitude before her
judge which has never been surpassed
by man, and suffering without
resistance torture of exquisite
cruelty&mdash;the tearing open of her
bosom by iron shears. In the same
century Apollonia, daughter of a
magistrate in Alexandria, was baptized
by a disciple of S. Anthony,
and there appeared an angel, who
threw over her a garment of dazzling
white, saying, “Go now to
Alexandria and preach the faith of
Christ.” Many were converted by
her eloquence; for her refusal to
worship the gods she was bound to
a column, and her beautiful teeth
were pulled out one by one by a
pair of pincers, as an appropriate
atonement for her crime. Then a
fire was kindled, and she was flung
into it. Apollonia preaching to
the people of Alexandria forms the
subject of a famous picture by a
favorite pupil of Michael Angelo&mdash;Granacci&mdash;in
the Munich gallery.
In the beginning of the IVth century
a Roman maiden, whose name is
popularly known as Agnes, gave up
her life for her faith. “Her tender
sex,” says a Protestant writer, “her
almost childish years, her beauty,
innocence, and heroic defence of
her chastity, the high antiquity of
the veneration paid to her, have all
combined to invest the person and
character of S. Agnes with a charm,
an interest, a reality, to which the
most sceptical are not wholly insensible.”
The son of the Prefect of
Rome became enamored of her
comeliness, and asked her parents
to give her to him as his wife. Agnes
repelled his advances and declined
his gifts. Then the prefect
ordered her to enter the service of
Vesta, and she refused the command
with disdain. Chains and
threats failed to intimidate her;
resort was had to a form of torture
so atrocious that her woman’s heart,
but for a miracle of grace, must have
quailed in the pangs of anticipation.
She was exposed nude in a place
of infamy, and her head fell “in
meek shame” upon her bosom.
She prayed, and “immediately her
hair, which was already long and
abundant, became like a veil, covering
her whole person from head
to foot; and those who looked upon
her were seized with awe and
fear as of something sacred, and
dared not lift their eyes.” When
fire refused to consume her body,
the executioner mounted the obstinate
fagots, and ended her torments
by the sword. She is the favorite
saint of the Roman women; two
churches in the Eternal City bear
her name; there is no saint whose
effigy is older than hers; and Domenichino,
Titian, Paul Veronese,
and Tintoretto have perpetuated
her glory. In the previous year,
at Syracuse, Lucia, a noble damsel,
refused a pagan husband of high
lineage and great riches, preferring
to consecrate herself to a divine
Spouse. Her discarded suitor betrayed
her to the persecutors, from
whose hands she escaped by dying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
in prison of her wounds. Euphemia,
who is venerated in the East
by the surname of <em>Great</em>, and to
whom four churches are erected
in Constantinople, died a frightful
death in Chalcedon, four years after
Lucia had perished in Syracuse.
So general was the homage paid her
heroism that Leo the Isaurian ordered
that her churches be profaned
and her relics be cast into the
sea. Devotion found means for
evading the mandate, and the sacred
remains were preserved. In
the same year Catherine, a niece
of Constantine the Great, was martyred
at Alexandria. From her
childhood it was manifest that she
had been rightly named&mdash;from
καθαρός, pure, undefiled. Her
graces of mind and person were the
wonder and admiration of the people.
Her father was King of Egypt, and
she his heir. When she ascended the
throne, she devoted herself to the
study of philosophy. Plato was her
favorite author. It is declared that
her scholarship was so profound,
so varied, and so exact that she
confounded a company of the ablest
heathen philosophers. The Emperor
Maximin, failing to induce
her to apostatize, had constructed
four wheels, armed with blades, and
revolving in opposite directions.
Between these she was bound; but
God miraculously preserved her.
Then she was driven from Alexandria,
scourged, and beheaded. St.
Catherine has been honored for
many centuries as the patroness of
learning and eloquence. In art S.
Jerome’s name and hers are frequently
associated together, as the
two patrons of scholastic theology.
She carries a book in her hands,
like S. Thomas Aquinas and S.
Bonaventure, to symbolize her learning,
and her statue is to be found in
the old universities and schools.
She was especially honored in the
University of Padua, the <i lang="la">Alma Mater</i>
of Christopher Columbus. In England
alone there were upwards of fifty
churches dedicated in her name.
The painters have loved to treat
her as the Christian Urania, the
goddess of science and philosophy.
She afforded delightful opportunities
of genius to Raphael, Guido,
Titian, Correggio, Albert Dürer.
In the same century and about the
same year Barbara, the daughter
of a nobleman in Heliopolis, was
decapitated by her enraged father
on discovering her profession of the
Christian faith; Margaret, who refused
to become the wife of a pagan
governor, was beheaded at Antioch;
Dorothea was slain in Cappadocia.</p>

<p>Sometimes the women of these
early days walked to martyrdom
with father, husband, brother, or
friend; as Domnina and Theonilla;
Lucia with Gemmianus, under Diocletian;
Daria with Chrysanthus,
Cecilia with Valerian, Tiburtius, and
Maximus; Flora and Mary in Cordova;
Dorothea and her troop of
followers; Theodora with Didymus;
Victoria and Fortunatus; Bibiana,
a young Roman lady, with her father,
mother, and sister, whom she
inspired and sustained.</p>

<p>Shall we prolong the calendar to
show that woman’s courage did not
expire with the fervor of apostolic
times? There were Thrasilla and
Emiliana, aunts of Gregory the
Great. There was the English abbess,
Ebba, who, with her entire
household, perished in the flames
of their convent; the noble Helen
of Sweden, who was murdered by
her relatives in the XIth century.</p>

<p>Did women seek the solitude of
the wilderness and the perils of the
forest to serve God as hermits and
solitaries? They began the practice
of the ascetic life in the apostolic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
days; they had formed communities
as early as the IId century;
many lived in couples, as the anchorets
Marava and Cyra in the
first century; some imitated the
example of Mary of Egypt, who
spent twenty-seven years in isolation.
There were the Irish hermit,
Maxentia in France; and Modneva,
in the IXth century, also Irish, who
dwelt for seven years alone in the
Island of Trent. S. Bridget of Ireland
had her first cell in the trunk
of an oak-tree.</p>

<p>When we undertake to answer
what sacrifices women have made
for religion, it is difficult to frame
an adequate reply with sufficient
brevity. From the day that S. Catherine
gave up the throne of Egypt
until this hour, women have been
sacrificing for the Catholic faith&mdash;everything.
If the objects of their
attachment are fewer than those of
men, their domestic love is of more
exquisite sensibility, and its rupture
is in many cases, not the result
of an instant’s strong resolve, but
the slow martyrdom of a lifetime.
Nearly all the early heroines of
Christianity were women of high
social position, of rich and luxurious
homes, and many were noted
for their beauty, their culture, or
their address. Some were on the
eve of happy betrothals; yet Eucratis
spurns a lover, and Rufina
and Secunda depart from apostate
husbands. It was to the courage
and self-sacrifice of their respective
wives that the martyrs Hadrian and
Valerian are indebted for their
palms. In the IVth century we
see the Empress Helen, mother of
Constantine the Great, when fourscore
years of age, proceeding from
Constantinople to Palestine for the
purpose of adorning churches and
worshipping our Lord in the regions
consecrated by his presence. It
was she who discovered the true
cross of Christ. In the VIIth century
Queen Cuthburge of England
resigned royal pleasures, founded
a convent, and lived and died in it.
In the VIIth century Hereswith,
Queen of the East-Angles, withdrew
from royalty, and became an inmate
of the convent in Chelles, France.
Queen Bathilde, of France, followed
her thither as soon as her son,
Clotaire III., had reached his majority,
“and obeyed her superior as
if she were the last Sister in the
house.” The abbess herself, who
was also of an illustrious family, was
“the most humble and most fervent,”
and “showed by her conduct
that no one commands well or
with safety who has not first learned
and is not always ready to obey
well.” Radegunde, another queen
of France, also passed from a court
to a cloister. In the IXth century
Alice, Empress of Germany, presented,
in two regencies, the extraordinary
power of religion in producing
a wise and efficient administration
of political affairs. She
was virtually a recluse living and
acting in the splendor of a throne.
Is it necessary to more than allude
to S. Elizabeth of Hungary, or to
her niece, Queen Elizabeth of Portugal,
who, after a glorious career,
to which we shall allude in another
connection, joined the Order of
Poor Clares? In the East, Pulcheria,
the empress, granddaughter of
Theodosius the Great, withdrew
from a <i lang="fr">régime</i> in which she was the
controlling spirit, and did not return
from her austerities until urgently
requested to do so by Pope
S. Leo. At her death she bequeathed
all her goods and private estates
to the poor. Queen Maud of England
walked daily to church barefoot,
wearing a garment of sackcloth,
and washed and kissed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
feet of the poor. It was a queen,
Jane of France, who became the
foundress of the Nuns of the Annunciation.</p>

<p>When we consider the part that
woman has had in the formation of
the various religious orders, the
temerity of the ex-premier in belittling
her influence assumes still
greater proportions. The undeniable
fact that Protestantism has never
been able permanently to maintain
a single community of women,
either for contemplation or benevolence,
proves that the Catholic
Church alone is the sphere in
which woman’s religious zeal finds
its fullest and most complete expression;
that it is the Catholic
faith alone which thoroughly
arouses and solidly supports the
enthusiasm of her nature, and embodies
her ardor into a useful and
enduring form. The achievements
of women in the religious
orders demonstrate that it is impossible
to exaggerate this enthusiasm
or to overestimate the subtle
influence which she exerts in society,
Catholic and non-Catholic.
Human nature, in whatever creed,
bows in involuntary homage to the
woman who has left her home, and
father and mother, brother, sister,
and friends, to follow Jesus Christ
and him crucified. This instinct
is as old as man. The pagan
Greek, the brutal Roman, punished
with almost incredible severity
offences against their oracles
and vestals. History furnishes no
instance of a nation possessing a
religion however ridiculous, a worship
however coarse and senseless,
which did not award exceptional
deference to the virgins consecrated
to the service of its gods.
Christianity, which emancipated
woman from the domestic slavery
in which usage had placed and
law confirmed her; which made
her man’s peer by its indissoluble
marriage tie; and which compelled
courts and judges to modify barbarous
statutes affecting her civil
rights as well as her conjugal
relations, has been rewarded by
eighteen hundred years of unflagging
zeal and unshrinking heroism.
If woman had done nothing in the
household for the church; if she
had been indifferent as a wife and
incompetent as a mother; if in the
world the sex were merely frivolous,
pretty things, such as Diderot
would describe with “the pen dipped
in the humid colors of the
rainbow, and the paper dried with
the dust gathered from the wings
of a butterfly”; if they had never
done anything for religion except
what they have done out of the
world&mdash;in the shade, as it were&mdash;Christianity
would still have been
the gainer, civilization would owe
them a vast balance, and the sneer
of the ex-premier would be found to
describe only his own bitterness.</p>

<p>There has been no salic law in
the Catholic Church. Her crowns
cover women’s heads as well as
men’s; women themselves have vindicated
their right to spiritual royalty.</p>

<p>The activity of women for the
spread of the Gospel began, as we
have seen, in the days of the apostles,
when the preaching of Thecla,
the exhortations of many women
converts, and the courageous utterances
of those being led to martyrdom,
won multitudes to Christ.
The monastic life of woman is as
old as that of man. Indeed, our
word <em>nun</em>, derived from the Greek
νὀννα, passed into the latter language
from the Egyptian, in which
it was synonymous with <em>fair</em>, <em>beautiful</em>.
As rapidly as Christianity
moved over the world women joyfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
accepted its precepts and hastened
to its propagation. Lamartine
says that “nature has given
women two painful but heavenly
gifts, which distinguish them, and
often raise them above human nature&mdash;compassion
and enthusiasm.
By compassion they devote themselves;
by enthusiasm they exalt
themselves.” These two gifts find
their freest exercise in conventual
life, whether strictly contemplative,
as the monastic life in the East was
in the beginning, or contemplative
and benevolent, as it became in the
West. It was, therefore, only natural
that women of all degrees
should listen to the voice of God
summoning them to this state. It
was not natural, however, to sever
the domestic ties which nature herself
had made and religion had blessed.
It was no easier in the days of
Ebba and Bega than in those of
Angela Merici, or S. Teresa, or Catherine
McAuley, for the daughter
to bid a final farewell to her home
and its endearments for an existence
of self-immolation, of prayer,
of obedience, of humility, and often
of hunger and cold, sickness, danger,
and want. That women in
large numbers have nevertheless
chosen this which the world calls
the worse life and the apostle the
better, from the time of the apostles
to the present day, shows that it is
in religion they reach the zenith
of their capabilities; for they have
made no such sacrifices, they have
achieved no such successes, in art,
in science, nor in literature. They
have entered the service of the
church through the convent gate,
in despite of difficulties which
would often have debarred men
even from the entertainment of the
design. Their toil in the convents
has been wholly in the service of
mankind. The history of the conventual
life of women is not divisible
from that of civilization, and in
rapidly sketching it we shall discover
chapters on the progress of
religion, the organization of benevolence,
the preservation of learning,
and the spread of education. The
assistance which women have rendered
to the last two has not been
properly appreciated.</p>

<p>The catalogue of eminent foundresses
is too long to be considered
in detail. Every country, every
century, has its list of noble virgins,
of wealthy widows, or of mothers
whose maternal duty was done,
building houses for established
orders, or, under the authority of
the church, founding additional
communities, always with a specific
design; for the church takes no
step without an intelligent purpose.
Among these women have been
many who were remarkable in more
qualities than piety, in other conditions
than social distinction; and
it is a fact which will scarcely bear
debate that it has been inside the
convents, or, if outside, under the
direction and inspiration of religion,
that the mind of woman has enjoyed
freest scope and produced palpable
and permanent results. It is
true that there have been great
women in profane history, ancient
and modern&mdash;a Cleopatra and
Semiramis, a Catherine in Russia,
an Elizabeth in England; in literature
a De Staël, a “George Sand,”
and a “George Eliot”; in histrionic
art, in poetry, and in court circles,
many women have equalled and
outshone men; and in science they
have significantly contributed to
medicine and mathematics. But
the annals of women in religion reveal
the heroic characteristics of
the sex developed far beyond the
limit reached in the world.</p>

<p>We have just mentioned S. Elizabeth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
Queen of Portugal. What
woman has surpassed her in perseverance&mdash;that
most difficult of
feminine virtues? What man has
surpassed the utterness of her love
for God&mdash;that sublimest of virtues
in either sex? At eight years of
age she began to fast on appointed
days; she undertook, of her own accord,
to practise great mortifications;
she would sing no songs but
hymns and psalms; “and from her
childhood she said every day the
whole office of the Breviary, in
which no priest could be more
exact.” Her time was regularly
divided, after her marriage to the
King of Portugal, between her
domestic duties and works of piety.
She visited and nursed the sick,
and dressed their most loathsome
sores. “She founded,” says Butler,
“in different parts of the kingdom,
many pious establishments, particularly
an hospital near her own
palace at Coïmbra, a house for penitent
women who had been seduced
into evil courses,” thus anticipating
the future Sisters of the Good
Shepherd. She built an “hospital
for foundlings, or those children
who, for want of due provision, are
exposed to the danger of perishing
in poverty or of the neglect or cruelty
of unnatural parents.” She won
her ruffianly husband, by patience
and sweetness, to a Christian life,
and induced him to found, with
royal munificence, the University
of Coïmbra. She averted wars,
and reconciled her husband and
son when their armies were marching
against each other. She made
peace between Ferdinand IV. and
the claimant of his crown, and between
James II. of Aragon and
Frederick IV. of Castile. What woman
of profane history furnishes so
illustrious and so substantial a
record as this? Religion alone
supplied its motive and maintained
its progress.</p>

<p>The foundress of the Poor Clares,
S. Clare of Assisium, was the daughter
of a knight, and had to suffer
contumely and opprobrium for
entering the religious state instead
of accepting proffered marriage.
Her sister and mother were led by
her virtues to follow her example,
and they founded houses of the
Poor Clares in all the principal
cities of Italy and Germany. They
wore no covering on their feet, slept
on the ground, practised perpetual
abstinence, and never spoke except
when compelled by necessity or
charity. S. Clare’s great fortune
she gave to the poor, without reserving
a farthing for herself. What
but religion could suggest, sustain,
and crown so martyr-like a life as
this? The Little Sisters of the Poor
are now nearest the model which S.
Clare became; and the Little Sister
of the Poor is greater in the sight
of Almighty God and in the honest
reverence of the human heart than
a De Staël or a “Sand”!</p>

<p>We merely allude to S. Jane Frances
de Chantal, the foundress of the
Order of the Visitation, whom our
American widow, Mother Seton,
foundress of our Sisters of Charity,
so strangely resembled in certain
properties of character and circumstances
of life. The conspicuous
virtue of these two women was the
same&mdash;humility. Space forbids
more than allusion to other noted
foundresses&mdash;Angela Merici, mother
of the Ursulines; Catherine
McAuley, of the Sisters of Mercy;
Mme. Barat, foundress of the Order
of the Sacred Heart, whose beatification
is in progress; Nano Nagle,
of the Sisters of the Presentation;
and those holy, brave, and zealous
women who are to-day leading their
respective communities in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
part of the world, whom to name,
even in illustration of an argument,
would be to offend. They are exercising
within convent walls the
sacrifices which made martyrs.
They are sending pioneers of religion
to the frontiers of civilization;
equipping hospitals, asylums, and
schools wherever and whenever called;
carrying out faithfully on our
continent the example set them by
the foundresses of American charitable
institutions; for our first hospital
in New France was managed by
three nuns from Dieppe, the youngest
but twenty-two years of age;
and in 1639 a widow of Alenson
and a nun from Dieppe, with two
Sisters from Tours, established an
Ursuline Academy for girls at Quebec.
Bancroft says: “As the youthful
heroines stepped on the shore
at Quebec they stooped to kiss the
earth, which they adopted as their
mother, and were ready, in case of
need, to tinge with their blood.
The governor, with the little garrison,
received them at the water’s
edge; Hurons and Algonquins,
joining in the shouts, filled the air
with yells of joy; and the motley
group escorted the new-comers to
the church, where, amidst a general
thanksgiving, the <cite>Te Deum</cite> was
chanted. Is it wonderful that the
natives were touched by a benevolence
which their poverty and squalid
misery could not appall? Their
education was also attempted; and
the venerable ash-tree still lives beneath
which Mary of the Incarnation,
so famed for chastened piety,
genius, and good judgment, toiled,
though in vain, for the culture of
Huron children.” Could anything
but religion enable delicately-reared
women to turn a last look upon
the sunny slopes of France, where
remained everything that their
hearts cherished, and set out in
1639, in a slow ship, over an almost
unknown ocean, with certain expectation
never to return, and
equally certain that in the new land
they would encounter an almost
perpetual winter and incur all the
perils of the instincts of savages?
What stately woman’s figure rises
in profane history to the height of
Mary of the Incarnation?</p>

<p>The part that woman has had in
the building up and the spread of
education has not, so far as we
are aware, been adequately written.
Perhaps it never will be; for the
materials of at least fifteen centuries
are, for the most part, carefully
buried in convent archives, and
their modest keepers shun publicity.
The lack of popular knowledge
in this portion of the history of education
has induced the erroneous
supposition that woman has done
little or nothing for the intelligence
of the race; that, until recently, the
sex received slight instruction and
possessed only superficial and effeminate
acquirements; and that
the free facilities which women are
reaching after indicate an entirely
new, an unwritten, chapter in the
culture of the sex.</p>

<p>Each of these suppositions is unwarranted
by facts. Women have
shared in the establishment of educational
institutions from the earliest
period of which we have authentic
record. Their resources have
founded schools, their talents have
conducted them. Whenever, from
the days of S. Catherine to those
of Nano Nagle, special efforts have
been made to teach the people, women
have furnished their full share
of energy and brains. The opportunities
which, even in periods of
exceptional darkness or disturbance,
were afforded for the higher
education of women, were far in
advance of the standard which prejudice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
or ignorance has associated
with women in the past; and the
increasing demand which we have
on every side for a more substantial
and scholarly training for the sex
does not look forward to that which
they have never had, but backward
to what they have lost or abandoned.</p>

<p>Again we find Mr. Gladstone’s
sneer answered; for religion&mdash;the
Catholic religion&mdash;has been the
sole inspiration of the part that woman
has had in popular education.
The magnitude of that part we will
only outline; but enough will be
shown of woman as a foundress, a
teacher, and a scholar to indicate
the rank to which she is entitled as
an educator, and the motive which
enabled her to attain it.</p>

<p>There were very few convents for
women which were not also schools
and academies for their sex. Many
Christian women, even in the days
of the Fathers, were not only skilled
in sacred science, but in profane
literature, and these, naturally and
inevitably, taught the younger members
of their own households, and,
when they entered the service of
the church, became teachers of the
children of the people. In the
IVth century Hypatia, invited by
the magistrates of Alexandria to
teach philosophy, led many of her
pupils to Christianity, although she
herself did not have the grace to
embrace it; but her learning induced
many women to profound and
elegant study. We have spoken of
S. Catherine, who confuted the
pagan philosophers of that city of
schools, and whose condition was
the delight of her contemporaries.
The mothers and sisters in those
early days were not only willing
but able to teach the science of
Christianity and letters. S. Paul
himself alludes to the instruction
he received from his mother, Lois,
and his grandmother, Eunice. It
was S. Macrina who taught S. Basil
and S. Gregory of Nyssa. It
was Theodora who instructed Cosmas
and Damian. “Even as early
as the IId century,” says a distinguished
scholar, “the zeal of religious
women for letters excited the
bile and provoked the satire of the
enemies of Christianity.” S. Fulgentius
was educated by his mother.
So solicitous was she about
the purity of his Greek accent
“that she made him learn by heart
the poems of Homer and Menander
before he studied his Latin rudiments.”
It was S. Paula who moved
S. Jerome to some of his greatest
literary labors; and the latter
assures us that the gentle S. Eustochium
wrote and spoke Hebrew
without Latin adulteration. S.
Chrysostom dedicated seventeen
letters to S. Olympias; and S. Marcella,
on account of her rare acquirements,
was known as “the
glory of the Roman ladies.” S.
Melania and S. Cæsaria were noted
for their accomplishments.</p>

<p>Montalembert declares that literary
pursuits were cultivated in the
VIIth and VIIIth centuries in the
convents in England, “with no less
care and perseverance” than in the
monasteries, “and perhaps with still
greater enthusiasm.” The nuns
were accustomed “to study holy
books, the fathers of the church, and
even classical works.” S. Gertrude
translated the Scriptures into Greek.
It was a woman who introduced
the study of Greek into the famous
monastery of S. Gall. The erudite
author of <cite>Christian Schools and
Scholars</cite> says that “the Anglo-Saxon
nuns very early vied with the monks
in their application to letters.”
There is preserved a treatise on
virginity by Adhelm, in the VIIth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
century, which contains an illumination
representing him as teaching
a group of nuns. S. Boniface directed
the studies of many convents
of women.</p>

<p>Hildelitha, the first English <i lang="fr">religieuse</i>,
had received her education
at the convent of Chelles, in
France, “and brought into the
cloisters of Barking all the learning
of that famous school.” This
institution, about five leagues from
Paris, was founded by S. Clotilda,
and one of its abbesses in the IXth
century was Gisella, a pupil of Alcuin
and sister of Charlemagne.
It was in a convent school, that of
Roncerai, near Angers, that Heloise
received her education in classics
and philosophy; and Hallam, who
finds little to remark concerning
convent schools&mdash;because, we presume,
their archives were not
sought by him&mdash;says that the “epistles
of Abelard and Eloisa, especially
those of the latter, are, as far as
I know, the first book that gives
any pleasure in reading for six hundred
years, since the <cite>Consolation</cite> of
Boethius.” The learning of S. Hilda
was so highly esteemed that
“more than once the holy abbess
assisted at the deliberation of the
bishops assembled in council or in
synod, who wished to take the advice
of her whom they considered
so especially enlightened by the
Holy Spirit.” Queen Editha, wife
of Edward the Confessor, taught
grammar and logic.</p>

<p>The scholarly women of the time
were not all in England. Richtrude,
daughter of Charlemagne, had a
Greek professor. The historian
from whom we have already quoted
says, in <cite>Christian Schools and
Scholars</cite>, that the examples of learning
in the cloisters of nuns were not
“confined to those communities
which had caught their tone from
the little knot of literary women
educated by S. Boniface. “It was
the natural and <em>universal development
of the religious life</em>.”</p>

<p>Guizot ranks “among the gems
of literature” the account of the
death of S. Cæsaria, written by one
of her sisters. Radegunde, queen
of Clothaire I., read the Greek and
Latin fathers familiarly. S. Adelaide,
Abbess of Geldern, in the Xth
century, had received a learned
education, and imparted her attainments
to the young of her sex.
Hrotsvitha, a nun of Gandersheim,
in the Xth century, wrote Latin
poems and stanzas, which prove, says
Spalding, “that in the institutions of
learning at that day classical literature
was extensively and successfully
cultivated by women as well
as by men.” In the XIIth century
the Abbess Hervada wrote an encyclopedia,
“containing,” remarks
Mgr. Dupanloup, “all the science
known in her day.”</p>

<p>Nor were women content to study
and teach in their native countries.
When S. Boniface needed teachers
in Germany to complete the conversion
and civilization of the country,
he endeavored to enlist the
enthusiasm of the English women
of learning and piety; and Chunehilt
and her daughter Berathgilt
were the first to listen to his appeal.
They are called by the historian
<i lang="la">valde eruditæ in liberali scientia</i>. The
Abbess Lioba, distinguished for her
scholarship and her executive ability,
also accepted the invitation of
Boniface, and thirty nuns, of whom
she was the head, reached Antwerp
after a stormy passage, and were
received at Mentz by the archbishop,
who conducted them to the convent
at Bischofsheim, which he had erected
for Lioba. S. Boniface declared
that he loved Lioba on account
of her solid learning&mdash;<i lang="la">eruditionis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
sapientia</i>. Walburga, a subordinate
of Lioba, went into Thuringia, and
became abbess of the Convent of
Heidesheim, where she and her
nuns cultivated letters as diligently
as in their English home. The
church herself watched over these
efforts of women to elevate their
sex; for the Council of Cloveshoe,
held in 747, exhorts abbesses diligently
to provide for the education
of those under their charge. In so
great admiration and affection did
S. Boniface hold Lioba that he requested
that her remains might be
buried in Fulda, so that they might
together await the resurrection.
Lioba survived the saint twenty-four
years, during which she erected
many convents and received
signal assistance from Charlemagne.</p>

<p>The convent schools maintained
by these disciples of S. Boniface
were not the only ones in which
women obtained more culture than
is accorded to them in our own
boastful time. At Gandersheim
the course of study included Latin
and Greek, the philosophy of Aristotle,
and the liberal arts. One of
the abbesses of this convent was
the author of a treatise on logic
“much esteemed among the learned
of her own time.” It would be
easy enough to continue this record;
to carry on the chain of woman’s
assistance&mdash;always under the guidance
of religion&mdash;in the educational
development of Europe. It
is not easy to avoid dwelling on the
aid she rendered in the foundation
of colleges; of the standing which
she attained in the universities,
where, both as student and professor,
she won with renown and wore with
modesty the highest degrees and
honors.</p>

<p>The catalogue of that metropolis
of learning, the University of Bologna,
a papal institution, contains
the names of many women who
appeared to enviable advantage in
its departments of canon law, medicine,
mathematics, art, and literature.
The period which produced
Vittoria Colonna, who received,
her education in a convent, discovers
Properzia de’ Rossi teaching
sculpture in Bologna; the painter
Sister Plautilla, a Dominican;
Marietta Tintoretto, daughter of
the “Thunder of Art,” herself a
celebrated portrait-painter, whose
work possessed many of the best
qualities of her father’s; Elizabeth
Sirani, who painted and taught in
Bologna; and Elena Cornaro admitted
as a doctor at Milan. We find
a woman architect, Plautilla Brizio,
working in Rome in the XVIIth
century, building a palace and the
Chapel of S. Benedict. In the
papal universities, as late as the
XVIIIth century, women took degrees
in jurisprudence and philosophy;
among them, Victoria Delfini,
Christina Roccati, and Laura Bassi,
in the University of Bologna, and
Maria Amoretti in that of Pavia.
In 1758 Anna Mazzolina was professor
of anatomy in Bologna, and
Maria Agnesi was appointed by the
pope professor of mathematics in
the University of Bologna. Novella
d’Andrea taught canon law in
Bologna for ten years. A woman
was the successor of Cardinal
Mezzofanti as professor of Greek.
Statues are erected to the memory
of two women who taught botany
in the universities of Bologna and
Genoa. It is well to mention these
facts as a sufficient reply to the
flippant charge, too frequently
made, that the Catholic Church is
“opposed” to the higher education
of women.</p>

<p>The relation of women in religion
to the education and refinement
of the present day can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
lightly passed over. In the convent
schools in every part of the
world young women receive the
best education now available for
their sex. The demands of society
have affected the curriculum. It is
not as abstract or classical or thorough
as in the time of Lioba and
Hrotsvitha, but it is the best; and
it will return to the classical standard
as quickly as women themselves
make the demand. In a
word, the orders of teaching women
in the Catholic Church are, we repeat,
a sufficient answer to Mr.
Gladstone’s sneer at the status of
women in religion. It was out of
these that arose Catherine of Sienna&mdash;orator,
scholar, diplomate,
saint. Of these was S. Teresa,
whom Mgr. Dupanloup characterizes
as one of the greatest, if not
the greatest, prose writers in the
Spanish literature. Of these have
been hundreds, thousands, of women,
who, moved by the Spirit of
God to his service, have found
within convent-walls opportunities
for culture which society denies,
and who, in the carrying out of his
divine will, have made more sacrifices,
attained higher degrees of perfection,
and lived lives of sweeter
perfume and nobler usefulness, than
the mind of Mr. Gladstone appears
to be able to conceive. A religion
which makes conquests enough
among women, since it can inspire,
control, and direct them thus, is the
religion which must conquer the
world.</p>

<p>Finally, Mr. Gladstone forgot
the subtle power of mother and
wife, and the marriage laws of the
Catholic Church. The mother’s
influence for good or evil, but especially
for good, to which she
most inclines, is second to none
that moves the heart of man.
Whether it be Cornelia, pointing
to the Gracchi as her jewels; or
Monica, pursuing and persuading
S. Augustine; Felicitas, exhorting
her seven sons to martyrdom; or
the mothers of S. Chrysostom, S.
Basil, and S. Anselm, converting
their children to firmness in holiness;
or whether it be the untutored
mother of the savage, or
the unfortunate head of a household
setting an unwomanly example,
the mother’s voice, issuing from the
quivering lips or coming back silently
from the tomb, is heard
when all other sounds of menace,
of appeal, of reproach, or of tenderness
fail to reach the ear. Every
mother makes her sex venerable to
her son. The mother’s love is
above all logic; it destroys syllogisms,
refutes all argument. It
cannot be reasoned against; and
when the salvation of the child is
the motive, there is no power given
to man to withstand its seduction.
“It shrinks not where man cowers,
and grows stronger where man
faints, and over the wastes of
worldly fortune sends the radiance
of its quenchless fidelity.” Christ
himself upon the cross was not unmindful
of his mother; yet he was
God! Says the greater Napoleon,
“The destiny of the child is always
the work of the mother.” To the
end of time she will be, as she has
ever been,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The holiest thing alive.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The faith of the mothers, if they
believe in it, must become the faith
of the sons and the daughters.
That the Catholic mother believes,
even Mr. Gladstone will hesitate to
deny. In no faith but the Catholic
have mothers accompanied their
sons to martyrdom. In no faith but
the Catholic is the mother taught to
believe, while still a child at her
mother’s breast, that she will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
held responsible for the eternal
welfare of her children; that they
must be saved with her, or she
must perish with them. For this
salvation she will toil and pray and
weep; for this she will spend days
of weariness and nights without
sleep; for this religion will keep
her heart brave, and her lips eloquent,
and her hand gentle and
strong. For this she will work as
neither man nor woman works for
aught else; and for this she will lay
down her life, but not until the
sublime purpose is accomplished!
That done, she is ready to die.

<h3>STRAY LEAVES FROM A PASSING LIFE.</h3>

<h4>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller">AU REVOIR.&mdash;THE PILGRIM’S PROGRESS.</span></h4>

<p>We showed Kenneth such wonders
as Leighstone possessed, and
his visit was to us at least a very
pleasant one. My father was duly
informed of his harboring a Papist
in his house, and, though a little
stiff and stately and a little more
reserved in his conversation for a
day or two, he could not be other
than himself&mdash;a hospitable and genial
gentleman. And then Kenneth
was so frank and manly, so
amiable and winning, that I believe,
had he solemnly assured us he was
a cannibal, and avowed his voracious
appetite for human flesh, not a soul
would have felt disturbed in the
company of so good-looking and
well-bred a monster. Perhaps, after
all, had we questioned our hearts,
the capital sin of Papistry lay in
its clothes. Papistry was to my father,
and more or less to all of us,
the Religion of Rags. Leighstone
had no Catholic church, and its Catholic
population was restricted to
a body of poor Irish laborers and
their families, who were most of
them the poorest of the poor, and
tramped afoot of a Sunday to a
wretched little barn of a church
eight miles away, which was served
by a priest of a large town in the
neighborhood. However much of
the devil there might be among
them, there was certainly little of
what is generally understood by the
world and the flesh. Yes, theirs
was a Religion of Rags, and it was
at once odd and sad to see how
rags did congregate around the Catholic
church&mdash;an excellent church
indeed for them and their wearers,
but not exactly the place to drive
to heaven in in a coach-and-four. It
was a positive shock to my father to
find so fine a young man as Kenneth
Goodal a firm believer in the Religion
of Rags. Of course he knew
all about the Founder of Christianity
being born in a stable, and so on;
but that was a great and impressive
lesson, not intended exactly to be
imitated by every one. Princes in
disguise may play any pranks they
please. Once the beggar’s cloak is
thrown off, everything is forgiven.
We quite forget that hideous hump
of Master Walter in the play when,
just before the curtain drops, he
announces himself as “now the
Earl of Rochdale.” Indeed, it was
a kind of social offence to see a
young man of breeding, blood, and
bearing, such as Kenneth Goodal,
take his place among the rank and
file, the army of tatterdemalions,
that made up the modern Church of
Rome, as it showed itself to the eyes
of English respectability. Irish
reapers, men and maid-servants,
cooks, beggars, the halt, the lame,
and the blind&mdash;these made up the
army of modern Crusaders. S. Lawrence
himself was very well, but S.
Lawrence’s treasures were very ill.
The descendants of Godfrey de Bouillon,
the mail-clad knights of the
Lion-Hearted Richard, my ancestor
Sir Roger, all made a very respectable
body-guard for a faith and a
church; but the followers of Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
the Hermit, the lower layer of society,
the lazzaroni&mdash;these were
certainly uninviting, and gave the
religion to which they belonged
something of the aspect of a moral
leperhood, to be separated from the
multitude, and not even sniffed afar
off. Yet here was a handsome
young gallant like Kenneth Goodal
plunging deep into it, with eye of
pride and steadfast heart, and a
strange faith that it was the right
thing to do. It was positively perplexing,
and before Kenneth left us
my father had another attack of
gout.</p>

<p>Kenneth had the skill and good
taste never to obtrude unpleasant
discussions. The only thing about
him was a certain tone in his conversation
that made you feel, as decidedly
as though you saw it written
in his open face, that he sailed
under very pronounced colors. It
was no pirate, no decoy flag hung
out to lure stray craft into danger,
and give place at the last moment
to the death’s head and cross-bones.
It was the same in all weather
and in all seas. “The Crusades
only ended with the cross,”
he had said to me in our first conversation
together; and it seemed
that I saw the cross painted on his
bosom, and borne about with him
wherever he went&mdash;a very Knight-Hospitaller
in the XIXth century.
In our long rambles together he and
I had many a hard tussle. I was
the only one with whom he conversed
on religious subjects at all,
and when he went away he left the
leaven working. The good seed
had been sown, whether on stony
ground, or among thorns, or on the
good soil, God alone could tell.</p>

<p>We missed him greatly when he
went. He was so thorough an
antiquarian and such a capital
chess-player that my father was
irritated at his absence, and had a
second attack of the gout. Nellie
was looking forward and already
making preparations for the visit
we had promised to pay his mother
at Christmas; and as for me, I had
lost my <i lang="la">alter ego</i>, and spent more
time than ever in the churchyard.
Even Mattock noticed the frequency
of my visits; for he said to
me one morning, as I watched him
digging a fresh grave: “Ye’re a-comin’
here too often, Master Roger.
Graveyards and graves and
what’s in ’em is loike enough company
for me, but not for sich as ye.
It an’t whoalsome, it an’t. Corpses
grows on a man, they doos, and
weighs him down in spoite of himself.
I doant know what I should a-done
these twenty-foive year, only
for the drams I takes. I couldn’t
a-kep up, I couldn’t. There’s
somethin’ about churchyeards and
graves, a kind o’ airthiness loike,
that creeps into a man’s veins, as
the years come on him, that at
times I doant seem to know exactly
which is the livin’ and which is the
dead. We’re all airth, Payrson
Knowles says, and Payrson Knowles
is a knowledgable man; but he
doant come here too often. I know
we’re all airth; for an’t I seen it?
An’t I seen the body of as putty a
young gal as was ever kissed under
the mistletoe stretched out and
laid in her grave afore the New
Year dawned, and turned her out
a year or so after, a handful o’
bones ye might take in a shovel
and putt in a basket, and a doag
wouldn’t look at em? Ay, many
a sich! I’ve seen ’em set in rows
in the pews within thear, and seen
’em go a-flirtin’ and a-smirkin’ out
through yon gate; and when the
cholera cum, I’ve laid ’em row by
row i’ the airth here. I’ve got used
to it, bless ye, and could a’most tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
their bones. I knows ’em all, and
doant mind it a bit; and I shall feel
kind a-comfortable when my son,
whom I’ve brought up to the bizness
and eddicated a-purpose for it,
lays me by the side on ’em, yonder
in that corner where the sun shines
of an evenin’. But sich thoughts
an’t for you, Master Roger. Git ye
out into the sun, lad, and play
while ye may. There’s no sort o’
use in forestallin’ yer time. Ye
an’t brought up to be a grave-digger,
and ye’ve no sort a-business
here. Its onlooky, I tell ye, its
onlooky. Graves is my business,
not yourn. So git ye gone, Master
Roger.”</p>

<p>One effect came from my cogitations
with myself and my conversations
with Roger: I no longer
went to church. Indeed, I had not
been too regular an attendant at
the Priory for some time past. Still,
when, as not unfrequently happened,
my father was laid up with the
gout, I escorted Nellie to church
as in the old days, and thus sufficiently
sustained the Herbert reputation
for that steady devotion to
public duties that was looked for
from the leading family in the place;
and though Mr. Knowles, who was
a frequent visitor at our house,
grew a little chilly in his reception
of me when we met&mdash;I used to be
a great favorite of his&mdash;he had
never undertaken to mention my
delinquency to me. There was a
certain warmth in his agreement
with my father, when that good
gentleman broke out on his favorite
subject of the young men of the day,
that was very different from the old,
deprecatory manner in which Mr.
Knowles would refer to the hot
blood of youth, and the danger of
keeping it too much in restraint. I
came to the resolution that I would
go to no church any more until I
went to some church once for all;
until I was satisfied that I believed
firmly and truly in the worship at
which I assisted. Anything else
seemed to me now a sham that I
could no more endure than if I set
up a Chinese image in my own
chamber, and burned incense before
it. This was all very well for one
Sunday or two. But my father’s
attack was at this time unusually
prolonged; and when, Sunday after
Sunday, I conducted Nellie to the
church-door, and there left her, to
meet and escort her home when
service was over, my strange conduct,
unknown to myself, began to
be remarked in Leighstone, and assumed
the awful aspect in a small
place of studied bad example.
Poor Nellie did not know what to
make of me; far less Mr. Knowles.
It seemed that some silly young
men of the town, taking their cue
from me, thought it the fashionable
thing to conduct their relatives to
the church-door, leave them there,
and often spend the interval in
somewhat boisterous behavior outside
that on more than one occasion
disturbed the services; so that
at length Mr. Knowles was compelled
to mention the matter in general
terms from the pulpit, and came
out with quite a stirring sermon on
the influence of bad example on
the young by those who, if respect
for God and God’s house had no
weight with them, might at least
pay some regard to what their position
in society, not to say in their
own circle, required. Poor Nellie
came home in tears that day, and
I joked with her on the unusual
eloquence of Mr. Knowles. The
final upshot of it all was a visit on
the part of that reverend gentleman
to my father, who was just recovering
from his attack; and as ill-luck
would have it, I walked into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
room just at the moment when my
poor father, between the twinges of
conscience and the twinges of a
relapse resulting from Mr. Knowles’
eloquent and elaborate monologue
on my depravity, had reached that
point of indignation that only needs
the slightest additional pressure to
produce an immediate explosion.</p>

<p>“What is this I hear, sir?” he
asked me immediately in a tone
that sent all the Herbert blood tingling
through every vein in my body,
the more so that I observed the
look of righteous indignation planted
on the jolly visage of Mr. Knowles.
“What is this I hear? That you
refuse to go to church any more,
and that, as a natural consequence,
the whole parish is following your
example?”</p>

<p>“The whole parish!” I ejaculated
in amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; and what else should
they do when the heads of the parish
neglect their duty as Christians
and as English gentlemen?”</p>

<p>“Do their duty, I suppose; go
or stay, as it pleases them,” I responded
sullenly. Mr. Knowles
rose up to depart with the air of
one who was about to shake the
dust off his feet against me; but my
father detained him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Knowles, will you oblige
me by remaining? I have put up
with this boy’s insolence too long.
It must end somewhere. It shall
end here.” He was white and
trembling with rage; but his tone
lowered and his voice grew steady
as he went on. I was alarmed for
his sake.</p>

<p>“Look here, sir. There is no
more argument in a matter of this
kind between you and your father.
There is no argument in a question
of plain and positive duty. Your
family has been and still is looked
up to in this town; and rightly so,
Mr. Knowles will permit me to
add.” Mr. Knowles bowed a gracious
but solemn assent. “I have
attended that church since I was a
child, as my father did before me,
and as the Herberts have done for
generations, as befitted loyal and
right-minded gentlemen. You have
done the same until recently. What
has come over you of late I don’t
know, and, indeed, I don’t care.
What I do care about is that I have
a position to sustain in this town,
and a public duty to perform. The
Herberts are now, as they have ever
been, known to all as a staunch,
loyal, church-going, God-fearing
race. As the head of the family I
insist, and will insist while I live,
that that character be maintained.
When I am gone, you may do as
you please. But until that event
occurs you will take your old place
by the side of your father and sister,
or find yourself another residence.
Mr. Knowles, oblige me by
staying to dinner.”</p>

<p>I was not present at dinner that
day. I saw that expostulation was
useless, and accordingly held my
tongue. I knew of old that there
was a certain pass where reasoning
of any kind was lost on my father,
and a resolution taken at such a
moment was irrevocably fixed.
Like father, like son. Even while
he was addressing me I had quietly
resolved at all hazards to disobey
his order. So much for all
my fine cogitations regarding the
rules of right and wrong. Their
first outcome was a deliberate resolve
at any hazard to disobey a
loving and good parent, backed up
by all the spiritual power of the
church and things established, as
represented in the person of Mr.
Knowles. What my precise duty
under the circumstances was I am
not prepared to say, although I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
know very well that the opinion of
that highly respectable authority
known as common-sense would decide
the question against me. I
was not yet quite of age. If I belonged
to any religion at all, I belonged
to that in which I had been
brought up. For a young gentleman
who professed to be so anxious
to do what was right, the duty of
obedience to his father in a matter
where of all things that father was
surely entitled to obedience, and
where the effort to obey cost so little,
where the result as regarded
others could not but be satisfactory,
not to say exemplary, looked remarkably
like an opportunity of
regulating one’s conduct by the best
of rules at once. In fact, everything,
according to common-sense,
voted dead against me. On the
other hand there lay a great doubt&mdash;a
doubt sharpened and strengthened
in the present instance by the
very natural resentment of a young
gentleman who, perhaps unconsciously,
had come to regard many
of his father’s opinions with something
very like contempt, being lectured
publicly&mdash;the public being restricted
to Mr. Knowles&mdash;by that
father, as though, instead of having
just emerged from his teens, he
were still a schoolboy. Rebellion
begins with the incipient moustache.
Those scrubby little blotches of
growing hair on the upper lip of
youth mean much more than youth’s
laughing friends can see in them.
Their roots are the roots of manhood.
As the line grows and
strengthens and defines itself, each
new hair marks a mighty step forward
into the great arena to which
all boyhood looks with eagerness.
It is the open charter to rights that
were not dreamed of before. And
if the artist’s skill can advance its
growth by the use of delicate pigments,
why, so much the better. I
was a man, and it was a man’s duty
to assert himself, to do what was becoming
in a man, whatever the consequence
might be. All which meant
that I was determined to rebel.
Consequently, I declined to meet
the Reverend Mr. Knowles at dinner.
I strolled out, with doubtless
a more independent stride than
usual, to study the situation in all
its bearings, and resolve upon my future
course of conduct; for in two
days it would be Sunday, and the
crisis would have arrived.</p>

<p>The argument, interesting as it
was to myself at the time, would
scarcely prove equally so to the
reader, who will thank me for
sparing him the details. Doubtless
many a one can look back into
his own life and find a similar instance
of resolute disobedience,
which, it is to be hoped, he has as
bitterly repented as I did this.
Happy is he if he can recall only
one such instance; thrice happy if
he is innocent of any! I was moral
coward enough to forestall my sentence
by flight. I was young, strong,
and active, though hitherto I had
had no very definite object whereon
to exercise my activity. The world
was all before me; and the world,
as we all know, wears a very fascinating
face to the youth of twenty
who has never yet looked behind
the mask and seen all the ugly
things that practical philosophers
assure us are to be found there.
To him it is a face wondrous fair;
and heaven be thanked for the deception,
if deception it be, say I.
The eyes beam with gentleness
and love. Not a wrinkle marks
the smooth visage; not a frown
disturbs it. On the broad, open
brow is written honesty; on the rosy
lips are alluring smiles; in the
tones of the soft, low voice there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
magical music. What if some see
on that same brow the mark of
Cain; on the lips, cruelty; in the
eyes, death; on all the face a
calculating coldness? Such are
those who have failed, who have
missed life’s meaning and cast
away their chances&mdash;youthful philosophers
who have been crossed in
love, or voluptuaries of threescore
and ten. But to high-hearted
youth the world holds up a magic
mirror, wherein he sees a fairy
landscape full of harmony, and
peace, and beauty, and love, all
grouped around a central figure
surpassing all, beautifying all&mdash;himself
and his destiny!</p>

<p>Yes, I would go out into the
world, like the prince in the fairy-tales&mdash;he
is always a prince&mdash;to
seek my fortune. Up to the present
I had done absolutely nothing
for myself. Everything had run in a
monotonous groove mapped out according
to the conventional rule, as
regularly as a railway, and without
even the pleasing excitement of an
accident. Why not begin now?
Why not carve out my own destiny&mdash;carve
is an excellent term&mdash;in
my own way? “The world was
mine oyster, which with my sword
I’d open.” What though the oyster
was rather large, who said he was
going to swallow it? It was the
pearl within I sought; perish the
esculent! Who knows what discoveries
I may not make, what
impenetrable forests pierce, what
lonely princesses deliver from their
charmed sleep, what giant monsters
slay on the way, bringing
back the spoils some day to my
father&mdash;some day! say in six
months or so&mdash;and, laying them at
his feet, cry out in triumph, “Father,
behold the prodigal returned,
not like him of old, who had
squandered his inheritance and fed
on the husks of swine, but as a
mighty conqueror, the admired of
fair women and the envy of brave
men! Father, this mighty potentate
is I, Roger, your son, who
would not bow the knee to
Knowles!”</p>

<p>It was a pleasing picture, and
took my fancy amazingly. Had
any young friend of mine come to
consult me at that moment on a
similar project in his own case, I
believe my counsel to him would
have been of the sagest. I would
have told him to go home and
sleep over the matter; to be a
good boy and not anger a loving
parent. I would have advised him
that there is nothing like doing the
duty that lies plain before us; that
there was a world of wisdom and
of truth in that sage maxim of S.
Augustine, <i lang="la">Age quod agis</i>&mdash;Do what
you do; that his schemes were
visionary, his plans those of a
schoolboy, who clearly enough
knew nothing whatever of the
world (whose depths, of course,
I had sounded), who might have
read books enough, but had not the
slightest experience of that which
is never to be found in books&mdash;real
life; that, in pursuit of a
passing fancy, he was neglecting
the real business of life, and embarking
on a voyage to Nowhere
in the good ship Nothing, and
so on. That is the advice I
should have delivered to any of
my young friends who were idiots
enough to think that <em>they</em> could
venture to set out on such a visionary
road alone and without map
or chart to guide them. That is
how we should all have advised
our friends. But with ourselves&mdash;with
ourselves&mdash;ah! the case is
different. <em>We</em> can always do what
it would be the most presumptuous
folly in others to attempt. <em>We</em> can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
safely thrust our hand into the fire,
up to the elbow even, where another
dare not trust the tip of a little
finger. <em>We</em> can touch pitch, and
never show a soil. <em>We</em> can go
down into hell, and come back
laughing at the devil, who dare not
touch <em>us</em>. What would be moral
death to another is a mere tonic
to us. And yet, and yet, He who
taught us to pray gave us as a petition:
“Father, … lead us not
into temptation, but deliver us
from evil.”</p>

<p>My mind was made up; and let
me add that the fear of putting my
father to the trying test of acting
upon his resolution in my regard
had no small share in shaping my
resolve. I did not see him that
night, and on the next day he was
confined to his room by an attack
that necessitated calling in the doctor,
and kept Nellie, whom I did
not wish to see, by his side most of
the day. I felt that I could not
meet her eye without divulging all.
I had never done anything that
would cause more than a passing
care to those who loved me, and I
now moved about the house as
though I were about to commit or
had already committed a great
crime. Not accustomed to deception,
it seemed to me that any
passing stranger&mdash;let alone Fairy
Nell, who knew me through and
through, and had counted every
hair of that incipient moustache
already hinted at as it came, from
whom I had never kept a secret,
not even the pigments laid apart
for the cultivation of that same
moustache&mdash;would have read in my
guilty face, as plainly as though it
were written down on parchment,
“Roger Herbert, you are going to
run away from home&mdash;not a pleasant
excursion, my fine fellow, but a
genuine bolt!” I packed up a few
necessaries, and collected such stray
cash of my own as I could lay hands
on. The sum seemed a small fortune
for a man resolved on entering
on such a resolute life of hard labor
of some kind or another as I had
marked out for myself. Long before
that was exhausted I should
of course be in a position to provide
for myself. How that self-support
was to come about I had
not yet exactly decided on; but
that was to be an after-consideration.
While I was waiting for the
night to come down and shield my
guilty purpose, Nellie stole in from
my father’s room to tell me he was
sleeping, and that Dr. Fenwick
said a good night’s rest would relieve
him from all danger, and in
two or three days he would be himself
again. This comforted me and
enabled me to be better on my
guard against the witcheries of Fairy,
who came and sat down near
me; for she had heard or guessed at
the dispute that had arisen, and,
like an angel of a woman, now that
she had tended my father, came to
administer a little crumb of comfort
to me before going to bed.
What an effort it cost me to appear
drowsy and to yawn! I thought
every yawn would have strangled
me; but I was resolved to be on
my guard.</p>

<p>“How dreadfully sleepy you are
to-night, Roger!” said the Fairy at
last.</p>

<p>“Am I?” asked the Ogre, with a
tremendous yawn.</p>

<p>“Why, you’ve done nothing but
gape ever since I came in. I believe
you are getting quite lazy and
good-for-nothing.”</p>

<p>“I believe so too.”</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t you do something?”</p>

<p>“I think I will.” Another yawn.
“I’ll go to bed. Ten o’clock, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
Jove! What a shocking hour for
well-behaved young ladies to be up!
Come, Fairy, I will do something
some day. Is father better?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is sleeping quite soundly.”
Shaking her head and speaking
in a solemn little whisper:
“<em>O you naughty boy!</em>”</p>

<p>Clear eyes, clear heart, clear conscience!
How your mild innocence
pierces through and through
us, rebuking the secret that we think
so safely hidden in the far-away
depths of our souls! That gentle
little reproof of my sister smote me
to the heart.</p>

<p>“Why, Roger, what is the matter
with you?”</p>

<p>“It’s a fly; a&mdash;something in my
eye&mdash;nothing. Let go my hands,
Nell.”</p>

<p>“Look me in the face, sir. You
are crying, Roger. You have been
pretending. You were not sleepy a
bit. Dear, dear! Don’t go on like
that; you make me cry too.”</p>

<p>“Nellie, my own darling&mdash;Fairy&mdash;there,
let me blow the candle out.
I was always a coward by candle-light.
There, now I can talk. Nellie,”
I went on, clutching her close,
her face wet with my tears as well
as her own, and white as marble
in the moonlight&mdash;“Nellie, I have
been an awfully wicked fellow,
haven’t I?”</p>

<p>“N-no”&mdash;sob, sob.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have; and father is very
angry with me, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“N-no.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that if I were to
do something very bad you could
forgive me, Nellie?”</p>

<p>“You c-couldn’t do&mdash;anything
b-bad&mdash;at all.”</p>

<p>“Well, now listen. I haven’t
done much harm, I believe, so far;
neither have I done much good.
And now I make you a solemn
promise that from this night out I
will honestly try all I can, not only
to do no harm, but to do good&mdash;something
for others as well as
myself. Is that a fair promise,
Nell?”</p>

<p>“Dear, darling old Roger!” she
murmured, kissing me. “I knew he
was good all the time. I know&mdash;you
needn’t say any more. You
are coming to church with me to-morrow.
How pleased papa will
be, and how pleased I am! Here,
you shall have my own book to
keep as a token of the promise.
I’ll run and fetch it at once.”</p>

<p>She tripped up-stairs and came
back breathless, putting the book
in my hand.</p>

<p>“There, Roger; that seals our
promise. I’ve just written inside,
‘Roger’s promise to Nellie,’ and
the date to remind you. That’s
all. And now papa will be well
again. O Roger!”&mdash;she came and
kissed me again, as I turned my
back to the window&mdash;“you have
made me so happy. Good-night.”</p>

<p>I could not trust myself to speak
again and undeceive her. I kissed
her and did not look at her any more.
I heard her room-door close, and,
after standing a long time where
she left me, I followed her up-stairs.
I stole to my father’s door and listened.
I could hear his regular
breathing; he was sound asleep.
I do not know how long I listened,
but at length I crept away to my
own room. My resolution was terribly
shaken by Nellie’s innocent
confidence in me. It is so much
easier to endure harshness or suspicion
from persons to whom you
know you are about to give pain.
Why didn’t she scold me, or turn
up her pretty nose at me, or stick a
pin in me, or do something dreadful
to me&mdash;anything rather than
believe me the best fellow in the
world? But, after all, could I not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
return when I pleased? I had
often been away before for a month
or more on a visit to some friends&mdash;for
months together at college.
Why should I hesitate to go now?</p>

<p>Poor Nellie’s book was placed in
the very bottom of my bag, and
then I sat down and wrote the following
letter:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Nellie</span>: I am going away for a little
while&mdash;for a month or more, probably.
You must not expect to hear anything of
me within that time. If you do hear of me,
it will probably be through Kenneth
Goodal. Indeed, I leave England on
Monday, and my return will depend altogether
upon circumstances. Nobody
knows of my going or of my destination&mdash;not
even Kenneth; so that it will be useless
to make any inquiries. Give my love
to my dear father, and tell him that,
wherever I may be, the thought of him
will always accompany me and prevent
me from doing anything unworthy his
son and your loving brother,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Roger</span>.</p>

<p>“P.S.&mdash;I will keep my promise.”</p>

</div>

<p>This note, sealed and addressed
to Nellie, I left upon my table. I
waited until not a sound was to be
heard through all the house, and
again left my room to listen at my
father’s door. I listened at Nellie’s
also. Nothing could be heard in
either. They were sound asleep&mdash;dreaming,
perhaps, of me. My window
overlooked the garden, and a
soft grass-plot beneath received myself
and my bag noiselessly, as I
made the drop I had so often done
in play, to the mingled alarm and
admiration of Fairy. After a walk
of about five minutes I lit a cigar,
and felt somewhat more companionable
than before. The moon
had gone down long since, and a
faint flush in the east low down on the
horizon betokened the dawn. There
was a keenness in the air and a
freshness all around that quickened
the blood and inspirited the faint
heart. The sense of freedom awoke
in me with every stride that carried
me away from my father’s
house out into the world, whose
largeness I was beginning to feel
for the first time. There was something
about the whole enterprise of
novelty and boldness and change
that grew on me every mile of the
way. I thought less and less of
the consternation and grief I might
occasion to those I left behind me,
and whose existence was bound up
in mine. And striding along in
this frame of mind, I reached
Gnaresbridge, where I was not
known. My walk of eight miles
had given me a tremendous appetite.
I entered the railway hotel,
and, by way of beginning at once
my life of privation and economy,
ordered a right royal breakfast, the
best the railway hotel could offer.
I then took a first-class ticket for
London, engaged a room for one
night at the Charing Cross Hotel,
and, finding my own company not
of the liveliest, strolled out into the
streets.</p>

<p>The London streets are beyond
measure dull on a Sunday. There
is a constrained air of good-behavior
and drilled respectability about
the crowds going to and coming
from church at the stated hours that
strikes one with a chill after the
bustle and noise of the other six
days of the week. Religion looks
so oppressively dull and hopelessly
solemn. The citizens seem to run
up the shutters in front of their
own persons as well as of their
goods; to bolt and bar and case
themselves in a wooden stolidity
of dull propriety that is mistaken
for religion. I do not say that it
is not well done; I only say that to
me, at least, on this occasion it was
disagreeable. The light spirits I
had picked up on the road dwindled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
down immediately at sight of
the solemn city, with its solemn
crowds. The sombre gray of my
surroundings seemed to settle on
my mind and heart like ashes from
which every spark had gone out. I
fell a-musing, and involuntarily followed
one of the streams of people
that were moving along slowly to
some place of worship. I felt sick
at heart, and wished for the morrow
to come that was to bear me away
somewhere out of this tame and
conventional life, where religion as
well as business followed a fixed
routine. Before I knew or had
time to think how I had got there,
I found myself in a Catholic
church. I knew it to be a Catholic
church by the altar, and the
crucifixes, and the Stations of the
Cross around the walls, and the
general appearance of the congregation.
There is something about
a Catholic congregation that distinguishes
it at once from all others.
Heaven seems a happier place
somehow from a Catholic point of
view. I had visited Catholic
churches before, but was never
present at the Mass, and was about
to retire as soon as I discovered
my whereabouts, when curiosity,
mingled with the conviction that I
might be as comfortably miserable
there as outside, detained me, and
I remained. Somebody directed
me to a seat close to the altar,
where I could see everything perfectly.</p>

<p>The service was varied and full
of dignified movements, but I
could not understand its meaning.
The singing was good, it seemed to
my poor ear; but I could not say
the same for the sermon. A quiet,
pious-looking gentleman preached
from the altar a long and, to me,
tedious discourse. He seemed in
earnest, however, and now and
then his pale, worn face would light
up&mdash;once or twice especially when
he spoke of the “Mother of God.”
Indeed, I found myself just becoming
interested when the sermon
concluded. There was something
far more impressive to me than the
priest’s discourse, than the solemn
music, than the gleaming lights,
than the slow and reverent movements
at the altar, in the congregation
itself. The people preached
a silent but most telling sermon. I
looked furtively around, and watched
them. Whether they were mistaken
or not, whether they were idolaters
or not, there was certainly no
sham about them; after all, there
was something thorough about this
Religion of Rags. Beyond doubt
they prayed in real, downright
earnest. One man differed from
another; one woman from her sister;
this one was in rags, that in
silks; this man might be a lord, and
his neighbor a beggar; but there was
something common to them all.
They seemed, as they knelt there,
possessed of one heart and one
soul. They appeared even one
body. Their prayer seemed universal
and to pass from one to another
out and up to God. All
seemed to <em>feel</em> an Invisible Presence,
which, from association,
doubtless, I could have persuaded
myself that I also felt. A bell
tinkles, once, twice, thrice; once,
twice, thrice again. There is an instantaneous
hush; the low breathing
of the organ has ceased; and
every head and heart is bowed
down in silent and awful adoration.
Involuntarily I also knelt and
bowed.</p>

<p>Deeply impressed, I left the
church at the conclusion of the
service, and seemed to be walking
in a dream, when a light touch on
my shoulder startled and recalled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
me to my senses, while a voice
whispered in my ear:</p>

<p>“Heretic, heretic! what dost
thou here?”</p>

<p>It was Kenneth Goodal who
stood smiling before me. The
tears sprang to my eyes, but he
was too much himself to notice
them. He drew my arm in his, and
led me to a carriage that was waiting
near the door of the church.
Within the carriage sat a beautiful
lady, whose likeness to Kenneth
was too apparent not to recognize
her at once as his mother. “I have
brought you a treasure,” said Kenneth,
addressing her; “this is the
very Roger Herbert of whom I have
spoken to you so much. Who
would have dreamed of catching
my heretic at Mass?” We were
rolling along through the dull
streets by this time, but it was
wonderful to think how their dulness
had suddenly departed. “Yes,
actually at Mass. And I verily believe
he blessed himself and said his
prayers like a true Christian. And
where of all places should they
plant you but right in front of
me?”</p>

<p>Kenneth’s mother was a sweet
lady&mdash;just the kind of woman, indeed,
I should have expected Kenneth’s
mother to be. To great intelligence
and that keen power of
observation so noticeable in her
son were added the charms of a
face and person that defied time,
while the veil of true Christian womanhood
fell over, softened, and
chastened all. She was a fervent
Catholic, who went about doing
good. Kenneth laughingly told
me that her conversion had cost
him a great deal more trouble and
difficulty than his own; but hers
once attained, his father’s followed
almost as a matter of course. Mrs.
Goodal had always been so pure
and blameless in her own life that
her very excellence constituted a
most difficult but intangible barrier
to her son’s theological batteries.
Even if she became a Catholic,
what could she be other than she
was? she had asked him once. Of
what crimes was she guilty, that she
should change her religion at the
whim of a youthful enthusiast?
Did she not pray to God every day
of her life? Did she not give alms,
visit the sick, comfort the sorrowful,
clothe the naked? What did
the Catholic ladies do that she did
not? She was not, and did not
mean to become, a Sister of Charity,
devoting herself absolutely to prayer
and good works. Her place was
in the world. God had placed her
there, and there she would remain,
doing her duty to the best of her
ability as a Christian wife and
mother.</p>

<p>It was certainly a hard case, and
she was greatly strengthened in her
position by her grand ally, Lady
Carpton. Both these excellent women
grieved sorely over Kenneth’s
defection; for Kenneth was an especial
favorite of Lady Carpton’s,
and had been smiled upon by her
fair daughter, Maud. The two
ladies had taken it into their heads
that Kenneth and Maud were admirably
matched, and their marriage
had long ago been fixed upon
by the respective mammas, who
never kept a secret from each other
since they had been bosom friends
together at school. The announcement
of Kenneth’s joining the Religion
of Rags fell like a bombshell
into the camp of the allies, scattering
confusion and dealing destruction
on all sides. Lady Carpton
washed her hands of him, and came
to the immediate conclusion that
“the boy’s mental obliquity was inexplicable.
The rash and ridiculous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
step he had taken was fatal to
all his prospects in this life, not to
speak of those in the next. He
had inexcusably abandoned the social
position for which his connections
and his rational gifts had eminently
fitted him. She had been
deceived, fatally deceived, in him.
He had destroyed his own future,
disgraced his family, and consigned
himself henceforward to a life
of uselessness and oblivion.”</p>

<p>Lady Carpton, when fairly roused,
had an eloquence as well as a temper
of her own. Majestically washing
her hands of Kenneth, she immediately
encouraged the attentions
of Lord Cheshunt to her daughter.
From jackets upwards Lord
Cheshunt had worshipped the very
ground upon which Maud trod, as
far as it was given to the soul of
Lord Cheshunt to worship anything
or anybody at all. Maud resembled
her mother. Great as her liking&mdash;it
was never more&mdash;for Kenneth
had been, her virtuous indignation
was greater. With some sighs,
doubtless, perhaps with some tears,
she renounced for ever Kenneth
the renegade, and took in his stead,
as a dutiful daughter should do, her
share in the lands, appurtenances,
rent-roll, and all other belongings
of Lord Cheshunt, with his lordship
into the bargain. It was on her return
from the bridal trip that her
mamma, with tears of vexation in
her eyes, informed her of the cruel
blow that the friend of her girlhood
had dealt her&mdash;out of small personal
spite, she was certain. The friend
of her girlhood was Mrs. Goodal,
who had actually followed that
scapegrace son of hers to Rome&mdash;had
positively become a Catholic!
And as though to confirm the
wretched saying that misfortunes
never come alone, between them
they had dragged into their fatal
web that dear, good-natured, unsuspecting
Mr. Goodal, just at the moment
when he was about to be returned
in High Church interest for
his native borough of Royston.
Thus “the cause” had lost another
vote, at a time, too, when “the
cause” sadly needed recruiting in
the parliamentary ranks. “My dear,”
she said impressively to
Maud, “you have had a very fortunate
escape. Who knows what
might have become of you? Lord
Cheshunt may not possess that young
man’s intellect”&mdash;and Maud was already
obliged to confess that superabundance
of intellect was scarcely
Lord Cheshunt’s besetting weakness&mdash;“but
you see to what mental
depravity the fatal gift of intellect
may conduct a self-willed young
man. Poor dear Lord Byron is just
such another instance. Mark my
word for it, Kenneth Goodal will
become a Jesuit yet!”&mdash;a fatality
that to Lady Carpton’s imagination
presented little short of the satanic.</p>

<p>I spent a very pleasant day and
evening with the Goodals&mdash;so pleasant
that it was not until I found
myself saying “good-night” to
Kenneth in the street that the occurrences
of the last few days flashed
upon me. “You will not forget
your promise of coming to-morrow,”
he said, as he was shaking
hands.</p>

<p>“To-morrow! Did I promise to
spend to-morrow with you?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“So Mrs. Goodal will assure you
on your arrival.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens! did I make
so foolish a promise? I cannot have
thought of what I was saying,” I
muttered, half to myself.</p>

<p>“Well, I will call for you in the
morning. By the bye, where are
you staying?” asked Kenneth.</p>

<p>“No, no. The fact is, I purposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
leaving town again immediately.
My visit was merely a flying one.
You must make my excuses to your
mother, Kenneth.”</p>

<p>“She will never hear of them.
Traitor! thou hast promised, and
thy promise is sacred.”</p>

<p>“It was really a mistake. Well,
if I decide on remaining in town
over to-morrow, I will come. If&mdash;if
I should not come, tell your mother
how charmed I was with her, and
with your father also. Kenneth, I
should be so glad if she would pay
Nellie a visit&mdash;my sister, you know.
Indeed, I am very anxious that she
should see Nellie as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“But you forget again that you
owe us a visit. Why not come at
once? You had better stay and
send for your father and sister.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will sleep on the matter.
Good-night, old fellow. In
the meanwhile do not forget my request.”</p>

<p>Again my resolution was terribly
shaken. I went over the entire
story, and weighed all the <em>pros</em> and
<em>cons</em> of the question, as I walked
back to my hotel. I had not yet
even determined where to go, still
less what to do. On arriving at the
hotel I went to the smoking-room,
feeling no inclination for slumber.
It had only a single occupant&mdash;a
naval officer, to judge by his costume.
He reached me a light, and
made some conventional remark on
the weather, or some such subject.
He was a jovial-looking, red-faced
man of about forty or forty-five,
with a merry eye and a pleasant
voice, and a laugh that had in it
something of the depth and the
strength and the healthy flavor of
the sea. My cigar soon coming to
an end, he offered me one of his
own with the remark:</p>

<p>“I like a pipe myself, with good
strong Cavendish steeped in rum.
The rum gives it a wholesome
flavor. But ashore I always smoke
cigars. You want a stiffish bit o’
sea-breeze up, and then you can
enjoy the true flavor of a pipe of
Cavendish. All your Havanas in
the world aren’t half as sweet. But
ashore here, why, Lord, Lord! a
pipe o’ Cavendish would smell
from one end o’ the city to t’other,
and all London would turn up its
nose. So I’m obliged to put up
with Havanas,” said the captain
(I was sure he was a captain) ruefully.</p>

<p>“What is a mortification to you
would be a pleasure to many,” I
remarked sagely.</p>

<p>“Ever been to sea?” he asked
abruptly.</p>

<p>“Never,” I responded laconically.</p>

<p>He looked at me with a kind of
pity in his glance.</p>

<p>“What! never been outside o’
this cranky little island, where men
have hardly got room to blow their
noses?” he asked in amazement.</p>

<p>“Never,” I responded again.
“And what’s more, up to the day
before yesterday I never wished to
go.”</p>

<p>My seafaring friend sighed and
smoked in silence. The silence
grew solemn, and I thought he
would not condescend to address
me again. At length, however, he
said:</p>

<p>“You’re a Londoner, I guess.”</p>

<p>I guessed negatively; but not at
all abashed at his mistake, he went
on:</p>

<p>“Well, it’s all the same. All Londoners
an’t born in London, any
more than all Englishmen are born
in England. But they’re all the
same. A Londoner never cares to
study any geography beyond his
sixpenny map o’ London. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
Marble Arch and Temple Bar,
Hyde Park and London Bridge, are
his points o’ the compass. Guild
Hall and the Houses o’ Parliament
mean more to him than the East
or West Indies, the Himalaya
Mountains, North or South America,
or the Pyramids. The Strand
is bigger than the equator, and the
National Gallery a finer building
than S. Peter’s. Your thorough,
home-bred Englishman is about the
most vigorously ignorant man I’ve
ever sailed across; and I’m an
Englishman myself who say it. I do
believe it’s their very ignorance that
has made them masters of the best
part of the world, and the worst
masters the world has ever seen.
They never see or know or believe
anything outside of London, and
the consequence is, they’re always
making mighty blunders. There,
there’s a yarn, and a yarn always
makes me thirsty. What will you
drink?”</p>

<p>I found my new companion a
shrewd and observant man under a
somewhat rough coating. He was
captain of a steamer belonging to
one of the great lines that ply between
England and the United
States, and his vessel sailed for
New York the next day. Here was
an opportunity of ending at once
all my doubts and hesitations. But
on broaching the subject to the
captain I found him grow at once
cautious, not to say suspicious.
That fatal admission about my
never having been to sea at all
told terribly against me. Then he
wanted to know if I had a companion
of any kind with me, which I
took to be sailor’s English for asking
if it were a runaway match.
Satisfied on this point, he grew
more suspicious still. Running
away with a young lass he could
understand, and perhaps be brought
to pardon; but if it was not that,
then what earthly object could I
have in going to New York all
alone?</p>

<p>“The fact is, youngster,” he blurted
out at length, “you see it an’t
all fair and above-board with you.
Youngsters like you don’t make up
their minds in half an hour to go to
New York; and if they do, they’ve
no business to. If you was a little
younger, I should call in a policeman,
and tell him you had run away
from home. I don’t want to help
youngsters&mdash;nor anybody else, for
that matter&mdash;to run into scrapes.
There will be some one crying for
you, you know, and that an’t pleasant
now. Now, then, out with it,
and let’s have the whole story.
There’s something wrong, and a
clean breast, like a good sea-sickness,
will relieve you. It’s a little unpleasant
at first, but you’ll feel all
the better for it afterwards. Trust
an old sailor’s word for that.”</p>

<p>I do not attempt to give the pleasant
nautical terms with which my
excellent friend, the captain, garnished
his discourse. However, I
told him my story, sufficiently at
least to diminish, if not quite to allay,
the worthy man’s scruples about
my projected trip, which, of course,
was only to last until the storm at
home blew over. Finally, at a very
early hour in the morning it was resolved
that I should make my first
voyage with the captain, and that
same day I penned, and in the afternoon
despatched, the following
note to Kenneth:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Kenneth</span>: By the time
you receive this I shall be on my way to
the United States. I said nothing to you
of my plans last night, because, had I
done so, I fear they might not have been
put in execution without some unnecessary
pain and difficulties. My chief reason
for leaving England is the great
doubt and perplexity that have fallen upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
me. Any hope of clearing up such
doubt in Leighstone would be absurd.
There all persons and all things run in
established grooves, and are more or less
under the influence of traditions, many
of which have for me utterly lost all force
and meaning. A little rubbing with the
world, a little hard work, of which I know
nothing, the sweetness as well as the
anxiety of genuine struggle in places
and among persons where I shall be simply
another fellow-struggler, can do no
great harm, even if it does no great good.
At all events, it will be a change; and a
change of some kind I had long contemplated.
A little difficulty with my father
about not attending church as usual
scarcely hastened my resolution to leave
Leighstone. I should feel very grateful
to you if you could assure him of this, as
I took the liberty on leaving of telling
my sister that they would next hear of
me in all probability through you. My
father’s kind heart and love for me may
lead him to lay too great stress upon
what in reality nowise affected my conduct
and feelings towards him. Time is
up, I find, and I can only add that wherever
I may go I shall carry with me,
warm in my heart, the friendship so
strangely begun between us.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">R. Herbert.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>I do not purpose giving here the
history of my first struggles with the
world, as they contain nothing particularly
exciting or romantic. The
circumstances that led to my connection
with Mrs. Jinks and Mr.
Culpepper are easily explained. My
small fortune disappeared with astonishing
rapidity, and, unless I did
something to replenish my dwindling
purse very speedily, there was
nothing left save to beg or starve.
I would neither write home nor to
Kenneth, being vain enough to
believe that the smallest scrap of
paper with my address on it would
be the signal for the emigration by
next steamer of half Leighstone,
with no other purpose than to see
me, its lost hero. Poverty led me
to Mr. Culpepper among others,
and the same stern guardian introduced
me to Mrs. Jinks. I must
confess&mdash;and the confession may be
a warning to young gentlemen inclined
at all to grow weary of a
snug home&mdash;that any particular romance
attached to my venture very
soon faded out of sight. The world
was not quite so pleasant a friend
as I had expected. The practical
philosophers were right after all.
Dear, dear! how the wrinkles began
to multiply in his face, and
what suspicious glances shot out of
those eyes, that grew colder and
colder as my boots began to run
down at heel, and my elbows gave
indications of a violent struggle for
air. It required a vast amount of
resolution to keep me from volunteering
to work my passage back to
England. I was often lonely, often
weary, often sad, often hungry even.
But lonely, weary, sad, and hungry
as I might be, I soon contrived to
become acquainted with others who
were many times more sad, lonely,
and weary than I&mdash;poor wretches
to whom my position at its worst
seemed that of a prince. The most
wretched man in all this world is
yet to be found. Of that truth I
became more deeply convinced
every day. It was a fact held up
constantly before my eyes, and I
believe that it did me good. It was
an excellent antidote to anything
in the shape of pride. Pride!
Great heavens! what wretched
little, creeping, struggling mortals
most of us were; crawling on from
day to day, inch by inch, little by
little, now over a little mound that
seemed so high, and took such infinite
labor to reach; now down in
a little hollow that seemed the very
depths, and yet was only a few
inches lower than yesterday’s elevation.
There we were, gasping and
struggling for light and food and
air day after day. Poverty reads
terrible lessons. It levels us all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
Some it softens, while others it
hardens; some it sanctifies, multitudes
it leads to crime.</p>

<p>Not that a gleam of sunshine
never came to us. Some stray ray
will penetrate the darkest alley and
crookedest winding, and warm and
gladden and give at least a moment’s
life and hope and cheerfulness
to something, provided only a
pinhole be left open to the heaven
that is smiling above us all the
while. I began to make acquaintances,
pleasant enough some of
them, others not so pleasant. There
was much food for meditation and
mental colloquy in the daily life I
was living, but I had no time for
such indulgence. I was compelled
to work very hard; for this was
certainly not a vineyard where the
laborers were few; and the harvest,
when gathered in, was but a sorry
crop at the best. Is not the history
of the human race the record
of one long and unsuccessful expedition
after the Golden Fleece?
Such stray remnants of it as fell
into my hand went for the most
part, for a long time at least, into
the treasury of Mrs. Jinks, who, like
a female Atreus, served up my own
children, the children of my brain,
or their equivalents, to me at table.
Horrid provender! One week it
was an art criticism&mdash;dressed up
with wonderful condiments and
melted down into mysterious soup,
whose depths I shuddered to penetrate&mdash;that
sustained the life in me.
Another time it was a fugitive poem
that took the form of roast beef and
potatoes. A cruel critique on some
poor girl’s novel would give me ill
dreams as pork-chops. A light,
brisk, airy social essay would
solidify into mutton. And so it
went on, week in week out, the
round of the table. An inspiriting
life truly, where your epigrams
mean cutlets, and all the brilliant
fancies of your imagination go for
honest bread and butter.</p>

<p>I believe that Mrs. Jinks secretly
entertained the profoundest contempt
for me and my calling, mingled
with a touch of pity for a
young, strong fellow who had missed
his vocation, and who, instead
of moping and groping over ink-pots
and scraps of paper, might be earning
an honest living like the butcher’s
young man over the way&mdash;an
intimate acquaintance and close
personal friend of mine who “kept
company” with Mrs. Jinks’ Jane.
I ventured once to ask Mrs. Jinks
whether she did not consider literary
labor an honest mode of earning
a living; but I was not encouraged
to ask a similar question a second
time. “She’d knowed littery gents
afore now; knowed ’em to her
cost, she had. They was for ever
a-grumblin’ at their board, and
nothing was good enough for them,
though they ate more than any two
of her boarders put together, and
always went away owin’ her three
months, besides a-borrerin’ no end
o’ money and things.” Such was
Mrs. Jinks’ experienced opinion of
“littery gents.” She was gracious
enough to add: “You know I don’t
say this of <em>you</em>, Mr. Herbert. <em>You</em>
don’t seem to eat as well as most
on ’em. You don’t grumble at
whatever you git. <em>You</em> don’t borrer,
and you never fetches friends
home with you at half-past three in
the mornin’, as doesn’t know which
is their heads and which is their
heels, and a-tryin’ to open the street-door
with their watchkeys; tellin’
Mr. Jinks, who is a temperance man,
the next mornin’, that you’d been to
a temperance meetin’ the night afore,
and took too much water. No,
Mr. Herbert, I wouldn’t believe
<em>you</em> capable of such goins-on. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
that’s because you an’t a reg’lar
littery gent; <em>you’re</em> only what they
calls an amatoor.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Jinks was right; I was only
an amateur, though I had a faint
ambition some day of being regularly
enrolled in “the profession.”
I flattered myself that I was advancing,
however slowly, to that
end. More than a year had now
flown by since I had left home. I
came to be more and more absorbed
in my work, and the days and
months glided silently past me
without my noticing them. This
close and intense absorption succeeded
in shutting out to a great
extent the thoughts of home. Indeed,
I would not allow my mind
to rest on that subject; for when I
did, I was quite unmanned. It was
not until I had made sufficient trial
of the sweet bitterness or bitter
sweetness, as may be, of what was
a hard and often seemed a hopeless
struggle, that I wrote to Kenneth
under the strictest pledge of secrecy,
giving him a true and unvarnished
account of my life since
we parted, and transmitting at the
same time certain evidences of
what I was pleased to accept as
the dawn of success in the shape of
sundry articles in <cite>The Packet</cite> and
other journals. He was enjoined
merely to inform them at home
that I was in the enjoyment of
good health and reaping a steady
income of, at an average, ten dollars
a week, which I hoped soon to
be able to increase; and by a continuance
of steady work and the
strictest economy I had every hope,
if I lived to the age of Methusaleh,
of being in a position to retire on
a moderate competency, and end
my patriarchal days in serene retirement
and contemplation under
the shade of my own fig-tree. I
described Mrs. Jinks and her
household arrangements at considerable
length, and did that estimable
lady infinite credit, while I
drew a companion picture of Mr.
Culpepper that would have done
honor to the journal of which he
was the distinguished chief. But
put not your trust in bosom friends!
Mine utterly disregarded my binding
pledge, and the only answer I
received to my letter was in Nellie’s
well-known handwriting on the
occasion and in the manner already
described.</p>

<p class="break">That was a stormy passage back
to England. We were detained
both by stress of weather and an
accident that occurred when only a
few days out. It was the morning
of Christmas eve when at length we
landed at Liverpool. The delay
had exasperated me almost into a
fever. I despatched a telegram to
Nellie announcing my arrival, and
that I should be in Leighstone that
evening. The train was crowded
with holiday folk: happy children
going home for the Christmas holidays;
stout farmers, red and hearty,
hurrying back from the Christmas
market; bright-eyed women loaded
with Christmas baskets and barricaded
by parcels of every description.
The crisp, cold air seemed
redolent of Christmas pudding and
good cheer. The guard wished us
a merry Christmas as he examined
our tickets. The stations flashed
a merry Christmas on us out of
their gay festoons of holly and ivy
with bright-red berries and an ermine
fringe of snow, as we flew
along, though it seemed to me that
we were crawling. Just as we entered
London the snow began to
fall, and I was grateful for it. I
was weary of the clear, cold, pitiless
sky under which we had passed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
London was in an uproar, as it always
is on a Christmas eve; but the uproar
rather soothed me than otherwise.
What I dreaded was quiet,
when my own thoughts and fears
would compel me to listen to their
remorse and foreboding. I saw
lights flashing. I heard voices calling
through the fog and the snow.
Songs were sung, and men and women
talked in a confused and
meaningless jargon together. I
heard the sounds and moved
among the multitude, but with a far-off
sense as in a dream. How I
found my way about at all is a mystery
to me, unless it were with that
secret instinct that guides the sleep-walker.
I saw nothing but the
white snow falling, falling, white
and silent and deadly cold, covering
the earth like a shroud. I remember
thinking of Charles I., and
how on the day of his death all
England was draped in a snow-shroud.
That incident always impressed
me when a boy as so sad
and significant. And here was
my Christmas greeting after more
than a year’s absence: the sad
snow falling thicker and thicker as
I neared home, steadily, solemnly,
silently down, with never a break
or quaver in it, mystic, wonderful,
impalpable as a sheeted ghost;
and more than a month ago my
sister called me away from another
world to tell me that my father was
dying.</p>

<p>“Great God! great God!” I
moaned, “in whom I believe,
against whom I have sinned, to
whom alone I can pray, spare him
till I come.”</p>

<p>“Leighstone! Leighstone!” rang
out the voice of the guard.</p>

<p>I staggered from the railway carriage,
stumbled, and fell. I had
tasted nothing the whole day. The
guard picked me up roughly&mdash;the
very guard who used to be such a
great friend of mine in the old
days&mdash;a year seemed already old
days. He did not recognize me
now. I suppose he thought me
drunk, for I heard him say, “That
chap’s beginning his Christmas
holidays pretty early,” and a loud
laugh greeted the sally. I contrived
to make my way outside the
little station. Not a soul recognized
me, and I was afraid to ask any
one for information, dreading the
answer that I could not have borne.
Outside the station my strength
gave out. My head grew dizzy; I
staggered blindly towards some carriages
drawn up in front of me, and
fell fainting at the feet of one of the
horses.</p>

<p>My eyes opened on faces that I
did not recognize. Some one was
holding up my head, and there
were strange men around me.
“Thank God! he recovers,” said a
voice I knew well, and all came
back on me in a flash.</p>

<p>“Kenneth!” I cried, “Kenneth!
Is he dead?”</p>

<p>“Hush, old boy. Take it easy.
Rest awhile.”</p>

<p>His silence was sufficient.</p>

<p>“My God! I am punished!” I
gasped out, and fainted again.</p>

<h3>THE CARDINALATE.<br />
<span class="smaller">I.</span></h3>

<p>The Senate and Sovereign Council
of the Pope in the government
and administration of the affairs of
the church in Rome and throughout
the world is composed of a
number of very distinguished ecclesiastics
who are called Cardinals.
The office and dignity of a member
of this body is termed the Cardinalate.</p>

<p>There is some dispute among the
learned about the precise origin
and meaning of the word cardinal
as applied to such a person; but
the commoner opinion derives it
from the Latin <i lang="la">cardo</i>, the hinge of
a door, which is probably correct;
but the reason assigned for the
appellation&mdash;because the Cardinals
are, in a figurative sense, the pivots
around which revolve the portals
of Christian Rome&mdash;is more descriptive
than accurate. At a comparatively
early age the parish priests
of the churches, and later the canons
of the cathedrals of Milan, Ravenna,
Naples, and other cities of Italy,
also in parts of France, Spain, and
other countries, were called cardinals;
and Muratori suggests that
the name was taken in imitation, and
perhaps in emulation, of the chief
clergymen of the church in Rome.
He thinks that they were so called
at Rome and elsewhere because
put in possession of, or immovably
attached&mdash;<i lang="la">incardinati</i>&mdash;to certain
churches, which was expressed in
low Latin by the verb <i lang="la">cardinare</i> or
<i lang="la">incardinare</i>, formed, indeed, from
<i lang="la">cardo</i> as above, and the application
of which in this sense receives an
illustration from Vitruvius, who
writes, in his treatise on architecture,
of <i lang="la">tignum cardinatum</i>&mdash;one
beam fitted into another.</p>

<p>Our oldest authority for the institution
of the cardinalate is found
in a few words of unquestionable
authenticity in the <cite>Liber Pontificalis</cite>,
or <cite>Lives of the Popes</cite>, extracted and
compiled from very ancient documents
by Anastasius the Librarian
in the IXth century. It is there
written of S. Cletus, who lived in
the year 81, was an immediate disciple
of the Prince of the Apostles,
and his successor only once removed:
“Hic ex præcepto beati Petri
XXV<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> presbyteros ordinavit in
urbe Roma, mense decembri.”
These priests, ordained by direction
of blessed Peter, formed a
select body of councillors to assist
the pope in the management of ecclesiastical
affairs, and are the predecessors
of those who were afterwards
called cardinals of the Holy
Roman Church. Hence Eugene
IV. said in his constitution <cite>Non
Mediocri</cite> (<cite>XIX Bull. Mainardi</cite>)
that the office of cardinal was evidently
instituted by S. Peter and
his near successors. Again, in the
<cite>Life of Evaristus</cite>, who became pope
in the year 100, we read: “Hic titulos
in urbe Roma divisit presbyteris.”
To this day the old churches
of the city, at the head of which
stand the cardinal-priests, are called
titles, and all writers agree that
the designation was given under
this pontificate. There is hardly
less difference of opinion about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
original meaning of this word than
there is about that of cardinal.
Some have imagined that the fiscal
mark put on objects belonging to,
or that had devolved upon, the
sovereign in civil administration
being called <i lang="la">titulus</i> in Latin, the
same word was applied by Christians
to those edifices which were
consecrated to the service of God;
the ceremonies, such as the sprinkling
of holy water and the unction
of oil used in the act of setting them
apart for divine worship, marking
them as belonging henceforth to
the Ruler of heaven and earth.
Others think that as a special mention
was made in the ordination of
a priest of the particular church in
which he was to serve, it was called
his title, as though it gave him a
new name with his new character;
and this may be the reason of a
custom, once universal, of calling a
cardinal by the name of his church
instead of by his family name.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
Father Marchi, in his work on the
<cite>Early Christian Monuments of Rome</cite>,
has given several mortuary inscriptions
which have been discovered
of these ancient Roman priests and
dignitaries, and from which we take
these two: “Locus Presbyteri
Basili Tituli Sabinæ,” and “Loc.
Adeodati Presb. Tit. Priscæ.”
After <i lang="la">locus</i> in the first and its abbreviation
in the second inscription,
the word <i lang="la">depositionis</i>&mdash;“of being laid
to rest”&mdash;must be understood.</p>

<p>Let us here remark with the
erudite Cenni that these titled
priests were not such as were afterwards
called parish priests or rectors
of churches, with whom they
were never confounded, and over
whom, as intermediaries between
them and the pope, they had authority.
These titulars were a
select body of men not higher in
point of <em>order</em>, but otherwise distinct
from and superior to those
priests who had parochial duties
to perform within certain limits.
Whether we believe that cardinal
meant originally one who was chief
in a certain church, just as was said
(Du Cange’s <cite>Glossarium</cite>) <cite>Cardinalis
Missa, Altare Cardinale</cite>, and as we
say in English, cardinal virtues, cardinal
points; or whether we accept
it as one who was appointed to a
particular church, it is not true that
the <em>Roman</em> cardinals were so called
either because they were the
chief priests&mdash;<i lang="la">parochi</i>&mdash;of certain
churches, or because they were attached&mdash;<i lang="la">incardinati</i>&mdash;to
a title. The
great Modenese author on Italian
antiquities has been deceived by
similarity of name into stating that
the origin and office of the cardinals
of Rome did not differ from that of
those of other churches (Devoti,
<cite>Inst. Can.</cite>, vol. i. p. 188, note 4).
Observe that the ordination performed
by Cletus was done by
direction of blessed Peter; that it
was that of a special corps of priests;
that it was not successive, but at
one time, and that in the month of
December, the same which an unbroken
local tradition teaches is
the proper season<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> for the creation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
of cardinals, out of respect for the
first example. Now, the pope surely
needed no special injunction to
continue the succession of the
sacred ministry; we may consequently
believe that the ordination
made by him with such particular
circumstances was an extraordinary
proceeding, distinct from, although
immediately followed by, the administration
of the sacrament of
Orders. Therefore if after the
Evaristan distribution of titles the
successors of these Cletan priests
came to be called cardinals, it was
not so much (accepting the origin
of the <em>name</em> given above) because
they were attached to particular
churches as because they were
attached <i lang="la">in solidum</i> to the Roman
Church, the mother and mistress
of all churches, or, better still, as
more conformable to the words of
many popes and saints, because
they were attached to (some good
authors say incorporated with)
the Roman pontiff. And it is
in this figurative but very suggestive
sense that Leo IV. writes
of one of his cardinals whom he
calls “Anastasius presbyter <i lang="la">cardinis
nostri</i>, quem nos in titulo B.
Marcelli Mart. atque pontif. ordinavimus”
(Labbe, <cite>Conc.</cite>, tom. ix.
col. 1135). In the same sense S.
Bernard, addressing Eugene III.,
calls the cardinals his coadjutors
and collaterals, and says (<cite>Ep.</cite> 237)
that their business is to assist him
in the government of the whole
church, and (<cite>Ep.</cite> 150) that in spiritual
matters they are judges of the
world. Not otherwise did Pope
John VIII., in the year 872, write
that as he filled in the new law the
office of Moses in the old, so his
cardinals represented the seventy
elders chosen to assist him. For
this reason cardinals alone are ever
chosen legates <i lang="la">a latere</i>&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, <i lang="la">Summi
Pontificis</i>. The cardinals of Rome,
therefore, were not cardinals because
they had titles, but just the
contrary. We have been a little
prolix on a point that might seem
minute, because there was once a
determined effort made in some
parts of France and Italy, especially
during the last century, to try to
prove that the cardinals of the Roman
Church were no more originally
than any other priests having
cure of souls in the first instance,
except that by a fortunate accident
they ministered in the capital of the
then known world. This was an
attempt to depress the dignity of
the cardinalate, or at least, by implication,
to give undue importance
to the status of a parish priest, as
though he and a cardinal were once
on the same footing. The like insidious
argument would be prepared
to show, on occasion, that the
pope himself was in the beginning
no more than any other bishop.
The same name was often used in
the early church of two persons,
but of each in a different sense;
and thus the mere fact of there
having been cardinals in other
churches than that at Rome no
more diminishes the superior authority
and higher dignity of the Roman
cardinalate than the name of
pope, once common to all bishops,
lessens the supremacy of the Roman
pontificate. In ecclesiastical antiquities
a common name often
covers very different offices. In
general, however, the instinct of
Catholics will always be able to
make the proper distinction, no
matter how things are called; and
the words of Alvaro Pelagio, who
wrote his lachrymose treatise <cite>De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
Planctu Ecclesiæ</cite> about the year 1330,
show how different was the popular
opinion of the provincial and of the
urban cardinals: “Sunt et in Ecclesia
Compostellana cardinales presbyteri
mitrati, et in Ecclesia Ravennate.
<i lang="la">Tales cardinales sunt derisui
potius quam honori.</i>” The name of
cardinal was certainly in use at the
beginning of the IVth century;
for the seven cardinal-deacons of
the Roman Church are mentioned
in a council held under Pope Sylvester
in 324; and a document of
the pontificate of Damasus in 367,
registering a donation to the church
of Arezzo by the senator Zenobius,
is subscribed in these words: “I,
John, of the Holy Roman Church, a
cardinal-deacon, on the part of
Damasus, praise this act and confirm
it.” Among the archives, also,
of S. Mary in Trastevere, there is
mention of Paulinus, a cardinal-priest
in 492. The name of cardinal
was restricted by a just and peremptory
decree of S. Pius V. in
1567 exclusively to the cardinals
of pontifical creation, and it was
only then that the haughty canons of
Ravenna dropped this high-sounding
appellation. The idea figuratively
connected with the cardinalship
in the edifice of the Holy Roman
Church is briefly exposed by
Pope Leo IX., a German, in a letter
to the Emperor of Constantinople.
“As the gate itself,” he says, “doth
rest upon its post, thus upon Peter
and his successors dependeth the
government of the whole church.
Wherefore his clerics are called
cardinals, because they are most
closely adhering to that about which
revolveth all the rest” (<cite>Labbe</cite>,
tom. ii. <cite>Epist.</cite> i. cap. 22.) The author
of an old poem on the Roman
court (<cite>Carmen de Curia Romana</cite>)
gives in a few lines the principal
points of a cardinal’s pre-eminence:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Dic age quid faciunt quibus est a cardine nomen</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Post Papam, quibus est immediatus honor?</div>
<div class="verse">Expediunt causas, magnique negotia mundi,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Extinguunt lites, fœdera rupta ligant.</div>
<div class="verse">Isti participes onerum, Papæque laborum,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Sustentant humeris grandia facta suis.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>More completely, however, than
anywhere else are the rights, prerogatives,
and dignity of the cardinalate
set forth in the 76th <cite>Constitution</cite>
of Sixtus V., beginning
<i lang="la">Postquam ille verus</i>, of May 13,
1585.</p>

<p>A fact recorded by John the Deacon
in the life of S. Gregory I.
shows us how high was the office
and rank of a cardinal, and that to
be appointed to a bishopric was
considered a descent from a higher
position. He says that this great
pope was always careful to obtain
the consent of a cardinal before appointing
him to govern a diocese,
lest he should seem, by removing
him from the person of Christ’s Vicar,
to give him a lower place:
“Ne sub hujusmodi occasione quemquam
<i lang="la">eliminando deponere videretur</i>.”
That bishops undoubtedly
considered the cardinalate, in the
light of influence on the affairs of
the whole church and the prospect
of becoming pope, as superior to
the episcopate, appears at an early
period, from a canon which it was
necessary to make in order to repress
their ambition in this direction.
In a council held at Rome
in the year 769 this canon was
passed: “Si quis ex episcopis …
contra canonum et sanctorum Patrum
statuta prorumpens in gradum
Majorum<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> sanctæ Romanæ Ecclesiæ,
id est presbyterorum cardinalium
et diaconorum, ire præsumpserit,
… et hanc apostolicam
sedem invadere … tentaverit,
et ad summum pontificalem honorem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
ascendere voluerit, … fiat
perpetuum anathema.”</p>

<p>There was at one period not a
little divergence of opinion about
the precedence of cardinals over
bishops; but the matter has long
ago been irrevocably settled. A
cardinal, indeed, cannot, unless invested
with the episcopal character,
perform any act that depends
for its validity upon such a character,
nor can he lawfully invade the
jurisdiction of a bishop; but apart
from this his <em>rank</em> in the church
is always, everywhere, and under
all circumstances superior to that
of any bishop, archbishop, metropolitan,
primate, or patriarch.
Nor can it be said that this is
an anomaly, unless we are also
prepared to condemn other decisions
of the church; for the precedence
of cardinals over bishops has
a certain parity with that of the
archdeacons in old times over
priests, which very example is
brought forward by Eugene IV.
in 1431 to convince Henry, Archbishop
of Canterbury, who had a falling
out with Cardinal John of Santa
Balbina: “Quoniam in hujusmodi
prælationibus officium ac dignitas,
sive jurisdictio, præponderat ordini,
quemadmodum jure cautum
est ut archidiaconus, non presbyter
suæ jurisdictionis obtentu, archipresbytero
præferatur” (<cite>Bullarium
Romanum</cite>, tom. iii.) But we
could bring a more cogent example
from the modern discipline of the
church. A vicar-general, although
only <em>tonsured</em>, outranks (within the
diocese) all others, because, as canonists
say, <i lang="la">unam personam cum
episcopo gerit</i>; with as much justice,
therefore, a cardinal, who is a member
of the pope, whose diocese is
the world, precedes all others (we
speak of ecclesiastical rank) within
mundane limits. There is one
example, particularly, in ecclesiastical
history that shows us how important
was the influence of the
Roman cardinals in the whole
church, and how great was the deference
paid to them by bishops.
After the death of S. Fabian, in
the year 250, the priests and deacons&mdash;cardinals&mdash;of
Rome governed
the church for a year during the
vacancy of the see, and meanwhile
wrote to S. Cyprian, bishop, and to
the clergy of Carthage, in a manner
that could only become a superior
authority, as to how those should be
treated who, having lapsed from the
faith during the persecution, now
sought to be reconciled. The holy
bishop answered respectfully in an
epistle (xxth edition, Lipsiæ, 1838),
in which he gave them an account
of his gests and government of the
diocese. Pope Cornelius testifies
that the letters of the cardinals
were sent to all parts to be communicated
to the bishops and
churches (Coustant, <cite>Ep. RR. PP.</cite>
x. 5). It is also very noteworthy
that in the General Council of
Ephesus, in 431, of Pope Celestine’s
three legates, the cardinal-priest
preceded the two others, although
bishops, and before them signed the
acts. Those who say the Breviary
according to the Roman calendar
are familiar with the fact that at an
indefinitely early age the cardinals
were created (just as now) before
the bishops of various dioceses
were named, hence those familiar
words: “Mense decembri creavit
presbyteros (tot), diaconos (tot),
<i lang="la">episcopos per diversa loca</i> (tot).”</p>

<p>The importance of a cardinal a
thousand years ago can be imagined
from the fact recorded by Muratori
(<cite>Annali d’Italia</cite>, tom. v. part. i.
pag. 55), that when Anastasius had
absented himself from his title for
five years without leave, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
residing in Lombardy, three bishops
went from Rome to invite him
back, and the emperors Louis and
Lothaire also interposed their good
offices.</p>

<p>Although all cardinals are equal
among themselves in the principal
things, yet in many points of costume,
privilege, local office, and
rank there are distinctions and
differences established by law or
custom, the most important of
which follow from the division of
the cardinals into three grades,
namely, of bishops, priests, and deacons.
Although the whole number
of suburbicarian sees, of titles, and
deaconries amounts to seventy-two
(six for the first, fifty for the second,
and sixteen for the third
class), the membership of the Sacred
College is limited since Sixtus
V. to the maximum of seventy.
There can be no doubt that the
episcopal sees lying nearest to,
and, so to speak, at, the very gates
of Rome, have enjoyed from the
remotest antiquity some special
pre-eminence; but it is not easy to
determine at what epoch their incumbents
began to form a part of
the body of cardinals. It is certain
only that they belonged to it
in the year 769. These suburban
sees all received the faith from S.
Peter himself; and the tradition of
Albano is that S. Clement, who
was afterwards pope, had been
consecrated by the apostle and
sent there as his coadjutor and auxiliary.
The number of these sees
was formerly seven, but for a long
time has been only six. The Bishop
of Ostia and Velletri is the
first of this order and Dean of the
Sacred College. He has the privilege
of consecrating the pope,
should he be only in priest’s orders
when elected, and of wearing the
pallium on the occasion.</p>

<p>The titles of the cardinal-priests
are fifty, some being held by persons
who have been consecrated
bishops but have no diocese, or by
jurisdictional bishops&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, those
who are at the head of dioceses
and archdioceses. The most illustrious,
though not the oldest, of
these is S. Lawrence in Lucina,
which is called the first title, and
gives its cardinal precedence&mdash;other
things being equal&mdash;in his
class.</p>

<p>In the life of S. Fabian, who
reigned in the year 238, we read
that he gave the districts of Rome
in charge to the deacons: “Hic
regiones divisit diaconibus”; and
these are supposed to have been
the first cardinal-deacons, or regionary
cardinals, as they were long
called. This order is third in rank,
but second in point of time when
it was admitted into the Sacred
College. The number of cardinal-deacons
became fourteen (one for
each of the civil divisions of the
city) towards the end of the VIth
century, under the pontificate of S.
Gregory the Great. In the year
735 Pope Gregory III. added four
and raised the number to eighteen,
which was reduced under Honorius
II., in the beginning of the
XIIth century, to sixteen. After
various other mutations of number
it was fixed as at present. Until
the pontificate of Urban II. in 1088
these cardinals were denominated
by the name of their district or
region, except those added by
Gregory III., who were called palatines.
After the XIth century they
were called from the name of their
deaconries. S. Mary in Via Lata is
the first deaconry. The cardinal-deacons
are often in priests’ orders;
but in this case they cannot celebrate
Mass in public without a dispensation
from the Pope, but they can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
say it in their private chapel in
presence of their chaplain. In
early times cardinal-deacons held
a position of very singular importance,
and the pope was frequently
chosen from their restricted class.
Even now some of the highest positions
at Rome are occupied by
them.</p>

<p>Although a cardinal is created
either a cardinal-priest or a cardinal-deacon,
there is a mode of advancement
even to the chief suburbicarian
see. This is called, in the
language of the Curia, <em>option</em>, or the
expressing a wish to pass from one
order to a higher, or from one
deaconry, title, or see to another.
The custom is comparatively recent,
and was looked upon at first
with considerable disfavor. It owes
its origin to the schism which Alexander
V. attempted to heal in 1409
by forming one body of his own
(the legitimate) and of the pseudo-cardinals
of the anti-pope Benedict
XIII. As there were two claimants
to the several deaconries, titles,
and sees, he proposed to settle the
dispute by permitting one of them
in succession to optate to the first
vacant place in his order. What
was meant as a temporary measure
became an established custom under
Sixtus IV. (1471-1484). If
a cardinal-bishop be too infirm to
perform episcopal duties in the see
which he already fills, Urban VIII.
decreed that he cannot pass to another
one. If a cardinal-deacon
obtain by option a title before he
has been ten years in his own
order, he must take the lowest
place among the priests; but if
after that period, he takes precedence
of all who have been created
in either of the two orders since his
elevation. The favor of option is
asked of the pope in the consistory
held next after a vacancy has occurred,
by the cardinal proposing
such a change. The prefect of
pontifical ceremonies having previously
assured himself that no cardinal
outranking the postulant contemplates
the same, the cardinal-priest,
to give an example from this
order, rises and says: “Beatissime
Pater, si sanctitati vestræ placuerit
dimisso titulo N. transitu ex ordine
presbyterali ad episcopalem,
opto ecclesiam N.,” naming his title
and the suburbicarian see that he
seeks to occupy.</p>

<p>These three orders of cardinals
certainly had a corporate character
at an early period, and formed what
the ancients called a college with
its officers and by-laws; but Arnulf,
Bishop of Lisieux in the Xth century,
was the first to call them collectively
<i lang="la">Collegium Sanctorum</i>; hence
in all languages it is now called the
Sacred College. A proof that the
cardinals acted together in a public
capacity, and of their exalted dignity,
is that they are termed <i lang="la">Proceres
clericorum</i> by Anastasius in the
<cite>Life of S. Leo III.</cite> In olden times
cardinals were strictly obliged to
reside near the pope; and a Roman
council, composed of sixty-seven
bishops, held in 853 under S. Leo
IV., called in judgment and deposed
the cardinal-priest of S. Marcellus
for having contumaciously absented
himself during a long time
from his title. This obligation of
residence in the house or palace annexed
to the title or the deaconry
was somewhat relaxed in the XIIth
century, when bishops of actual jurisdiction
began to be created cardinals.
The first example of a bishop
governing a diocese who was
made a cardinal is that of Conrad
von Wittelsbach, of the since royal
house of Bavaria, Archbishop of
Mentz, who was raised to this dignity
by Alexander III. in 1163.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>Innocent III., however, refused a
petition of the good people of Ravenna
to let them have a certain cardinal
for their archbishop, saying
that he was more useful to Rome
and to the church at large where he
was than he could possibly be in
any other position. At this period,
and until a considerable time after,
it was very rare that a bishop was
made a cardinal without having to
resign his diocese and reside <i lang="la">in
curia</i>.</p>

<p>Leo X. was so strict in his ideas
of the duty of cardinals to live near
him that he issued a bull renewing
the obligation in very strong terms;
and in 1538 it was proposed to
Paul III. to draw up a plan of reform
making it incompatible to
govern a diocese and be at the same
time a cardinal, except in the case
of the Fathers of the First Order,
who, from the nearness of their sees
to Rome, could perform their service
to the pope as his councillors
and assistants, and not neglect
the faithful over whom they
were placed (Natalis Alexander,
<cite>Hist. Eccl.</cite>, tom. xvii. art. 16). No
such stringent rule was adopted,
and a cardinal might be this and
govern a diocese, if he made it his
place of habitual residence, according
to the decree of the Council of
Trent (Session xxiii., on Ref., ch. 1).</p>

<p>Of the virtue, learning, and other
qualities required in a cardinal of
the Holy Roman Church, SS. Peter
Damian and Bernard have written
eloquently, and Honorius IV., of
the great family of Savelli, once so
powerful in Rome, was inexorable
against unworthy subjects, saying
that “he never would raise to the
Roman purple any save good and
wise men.” Different popes have
made excellent laws on these matters
and others connected with the
cardinalate; but in some cases they
have been disregarded, especially
those about age and about there
not being two near relatives in the
Sacred College at the same time.
The practice of the last hundred
years has been above cavil, and the
abuses of other ages have been exaggerated,
partly through malice,
and partly from not knowing the secret
reasons that popes may have
had for creating, for instance, mere
youths&mdash;royal youths&mdash;cardinals,
or conferring the high dignity upon
members of their own family, or
upon men who had nothing to recommend
them but the importunate
demands of their sovereigns. The
hat bestowed upon S. Charles Borromeo
was productive of more good
than all the rest of “nepotism”
was able to effect of evil.</p>

<p>The creation of cardinals is an
exclusive privilege of the popes; but
they have sometimes granted the
prayers of the Sacred College or
of sovereign princes asking to have
the dignity conferred upon certain
subjects. For a long time, especially
during the XVIth century, the
governments of France, Spain, Portugal,
Poland, and the republic of
Venice were favored by being permitted
to name once in each pontificate
a candidate for the cardinalate.
This was called a crown
nomination. Clement V. is said
(Cancellieri, <cite>Mercato</cite>, p. 105, note 3)
to have been the first to grant to
princes the right of petitioning for
a hat; and the sultan Bajazet II.
wrote on 28th September, 1494, to
Alexander VI., begging him to
make a perfect cardinal of Nicholas
Cibo, Archbishop of Aries, and cousin
of Pope Innocent VIII. Clement
XII. in 1732 tendered to
James III. (the “Elder Pretender”)
the nomination of some subject to
the cardinalate, and he, like a true
Stuart, neglecting his countrymen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
and those who had suffered in his
cause, proposed Mgr. Rivera, whom
he had taken a liking to for little
courtesies shown at Urbino. It has
long been a custom for the pope to
promote to this dignity a member
of the family or one of that religious
order to which his predecessor belonged,
from whom he himself received
it. The Italians call this a restitution
of the hat&mdash;<i lang="it">Restituzione di
capello</i>. The number of cardinals
has greatly varied at different times.
It was generally smaller before than
ever since the XVIth century. The
cardinals could, of course, well be
all Romans, as they were in the beginning;
but with a change of circumstances
the pontiffs have recognized
the propriety of S. Bernard’s
suggestive query to Eugene
III.: “Annon eligendi de toto
orbe, orbem judicaturi?” (<cite>De Consid.</cite>,
iv. 4). In 1331 John XXII.
(himself a Frenchman), being asked
by the king to create a couple of
French cardinals, replied that two
were too many, and he would make
but one, because there were only
twenty cardinals in all, and seventeen
of them were Frenchmen. In 1352,
after the death of Clement VI., the
cardinals attempted to restrict the
Sacred College to twenty members,
on the principle that a dignity profusely
conferred is despised&mdash;<i lang="la">communia
vilescunt</i>; but Urban VI.
found himself constrained, by the
course of events at the schism, to
create a large number of cardinals,
in order to oppose them to the
pseudo-cardinals of Clement VII.,
and at one creation he made twenty-nine,
all except three being his own
countrymen, Neapolitans; so that the
French of another generation were
richly paid back for their former
preponderance. From this time the
membership of the Sacred College
gradually increased up to the middle
of the XVIth century. It is
much to the credit of Pius II. that
when the Sacred College in 1458
remonstrated with him on the number
of cardinals, saying that the
cardinalate was going down, and
begged him not to increase its membership
to any considerable extent,
he told the fathers that as head of
the church he could not refuse the
reasonable requests of kings and
governments in such a matter, but
that, apart from this, his honor forbade
him to neglect the subjects
of other countries than Italy in the
distribution of the highest favors in
his gift (<cite>Comment. Pii II.</cite>, lib. ii. pp.
129, 130). Leo X., believing himself
disliked by many cardinals, added
thirty-one to their number at a single
creation on July 1, 1517, the like
of which the court has never seen
before or after; but it had the desired
effect. The Council of Trent
ordained (Sess. 24, <cite>De Ref.</cite>, c. i.) concerning
the subjects of the cardinalate
that “the Most Holy Roman
Pontiff shall, as far as it can
be conveniently done, select (them)
out of all the nations of Christendom,
as he shall find persons suitable.”
This is not to be understood,
however worded, as more than a
recommendation to the pope. Paul
IV. (Caraffa, 1555-59), a great reformer,
after consulting the Sacred
College and long discussions, issued
a bull called the Compact&mdash;<cite>Compactum</cite>&mdash;in
which he decreed that the
cardinals should not be more than
forty; but his immediate successor,
Pius IV. (Medici), acting on the
principle that one pope cannot bind
another in disciplinary matters,
created forty-six. Sixtus V. in 1585
fixed the number at seventy in imitation
of the seventy elders chosen
to assist Moses; and since then all
the popes have respected this precedent.
During the long reign of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
Pius VII., although, on account of
the times, unable to hold a consistory
for many years, he created in
all ninety-eight cardinals, and when
he died left ten <i lang="la">in petto</i>. Although,
on the one hand, an excessive number
of cardinals would lessen the
importance and lower the dignity
of the office, yet a very small number
has occasioned long and disedifying
conclaves, whereby for months,
and even years, the Holy See has
been vacant, to the great detriment
of the church. This was the case
four times during the XIIIth century,
and by a coincidence, each
time it was after a pope who
was the fourth of his name, viz.,
Celestine (1241), Alexander (1261),
Clement (1268), and Nicholas
(1292).</p>

<p>“Quacumque ingredimur, in aliquam historiam vestigium ponimus.”&mdash;<cite>Cicero.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>The most direct route from Paris
to Notre Dame de Lourdes crosses
the Bordeaux and Toulouse Railway
at Agen, where the pilgrim
leaves the more frequented thoroughfares
for an obscurer route,
though one by no means devoid of
interest, especially to the Catholic
of English origin; for the country
we are now entering was once tributary
to England, and at every
step we come, not only upon the
traces it has left behind, but across
some unknown saint of bygone
times, like a fossil of some rare
flower with lines of beauty and
grace that ages have not been able
to efface.</p>

<p>Approaching Agen, we imagined
ourselves coming to some large city,
so imposing are the environs. The
broad Garonne is flowing oceanward,
its shores bordered by poplars,
and overlooked by hills whose
sunny slopes are covered with
vineyards and plum-trees. Boats
from Provence and Languedoc are
gliding along the canal, whose massive
bridge, with its gigantic arches,
harmonizes with the landscape, and
reminds one of the Roman Campagna.
The plain is vast, fertile,
and smiling; the heavens glowing
and without a cloud. Every hill,
like Bacchus, has its flowing locks
wreathed with vines of wonderful
luxuriance, and is garlanded with
clusters of grapes, under which it
reels with joyous intoxication.
Everywhere are white houses, fair
villas, pleasant gardens, and all the
indications of a prosperous country.</p>

<p>The town does not correspond
with its surroundings. It is damp
and said to be unhealthy. The
streets are narrow and winding, the
houses without expression. The
population is mostly made up of
merchants, mechanics, and <i lang="fr">gens de
robe</i>. Here and there we find a
noble mansion, a few great families,
and a time-honored name; but the
true lords of the place are the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
functionaries, worthy and grave,
and clad in solemn black, quite in
contrast with the joyous character
of the people. The local peculiarities
of the latter may be studied to
advantage in an irregular square
bordered with low arcades&mdash;the
centre of traffic for all the villages
eight or ten leagues around. Famous
fairs are held here three or four
times a year, one for the sale of
prunes&mdash;and the Agen prunes are
famous&mdash;but the most important
one is the lively, bustling fair of the
Gravier, which brings together all
the blooming grisettes of the region,
who, in festive mood and holiday
attire, gather around the tempting
booths. The Gravier was formerly
a magnificent promenade of fine old
elms, which Jasmin loved to frequent,
and where he found inspiration
for many of his charming poems
in the Gascon language&mdash;one of the
Romance tongues; for the so-called
<i lang="fr">patois</i> of this part of the country is
by no means a corruption of the
French, but a genuine language,
flexible, poetic, and wonderfully
expressive of every sweet and tender
emotion. Some of Jasmin’s
poems have been translated by our
own poet Longfellow with much of
the graceful simplicity of the original.
Most of the fine elms of the
Gravier have been cut down within
a few years, to the great regret of
the people.</p>

<p>One of the most striking features
of the landscape in approaching
Agen is a mount at the north with
a picturesque church and spire.
This is the church of the Spanish
Carmelites, who, driven some years
ago from their native country, came
to take refuge among the caves of
the early martyrs beside the remains
of an old Roman <i lang="la">castrum</i>
called Pompeiacum. Here is the
cavern, hewn centuries ago out of
the solid rock, where S. Caprais,
the bishop, concealed himself in
the time of the Emperor Diocletian
to escape from his persecutors.
And here is the miraculous fountain
that sprang up to quench his thirst;
sung by the celebrated Hildebert
in the XIth century</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Rupem percussit, quam fontem fundere jussit;</div>
<div class="verse">Qui fons mox uber fit, dulcis, fitque saluber,</div>
<div class="verse">Quo qui potatur, mox convalet et recreatur.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That is to say: “Caprais smote
the rock, and forth gushed a fount
of living water, sweet and salutary
to those who come to drink thereof,”
as the pilgrim experiences to
this day.</p>

<p>From the top of this mount S.
Caprais, looking down on the city,
saw with prophetic eye S. Foi on
the martyr’s pile, and a mysterious
dove descending from heaven, bearing
a crown resplendent with a
thousand hues and adorned with
precious stones that gleamed like
stars in the firmament, which he
placed on the virgin’s head, clothing
her at the same time with a garment
whiter than snow and shining
like the sun. Then, shaking his
dewy wings, he extinguished the
devouring flames, and bore the
triumphant martyr to heaven.</p>

<p>After the martyrdom of S. Caprais,
the cave he had sanctified was
inhabited by S. Vincent the Deacon,
who, in his turn, plucked the
blood-red flower of martyrdom, and
went with unsullied stole to join
his master in the white-robed army
above. Or, as recorded by Drepanius
Florus, the celebrated deacon
of Lyons, in the IXth century:
“Aginno, loco Pompeiano, passio
sancti Vincentii, martyris, qui leviticæ
stolæ candore micans, pro
amore Christi martyrium adeptus,
magnis sæpissime virtutibus fulget.”</p>

<p>His body was buried before S.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
Caprais’ cave, and, several centuries
after, a church was built over
it, which became a centre of popular
devotion to the whole country
around, who came here to recall
the holy legends of the past and
learn anew the lesson of faith and
self-sacrifice. Some say it was
built by Charlemagne when he came
here, according to Turpin, to besiege
King Aygoland, who, with his
army, had taken refuge in Agen.
This venerable sanctuary was pillaged
and then destroyed by the
Huguenots in 1561, and for half a
century it lay in ruins. The place,
however, was purified anew by religious
rites in 1600; the traditions
were carefully preserved; and every
year the processions of Rogation
week came to chant the holy
litanies among the thorns that had
grown up in the broken arches.
Finally, in 1612, the city authorities
induced a hermit, named Eymeric
Rouidilh, from Notre Dame de
Roquefort, to establish himself here.
He was a good, upright man, as
charitable as he was devout, mocked
at by the wicked, but converting
them by the very ascendency
of his holy life. He brought once
more to light the tomb of S. Vincent
and S. Caprais’ chair, and set
to work to build a chapel out of the
remains of the ancient church. The
dignitaries of the town came to aid
him with their own hands, the
princes of France brought their offerings,
and Anne of Austria came
with her court to listen to the teachings
of the holy hermit. Among
other benefactors of the Hermitage
were the Duc d’Epernon, Governor
of Guienne, and Marshal de Schomberg,
the first patron of the great
Bossuet.</p>

<p>Eymeric’s reputation for sanctity
became so great that he drew
around him several other hermits,
who hollowed cells out of the rock,
and endeavored to rival their master
in the practice of rigorous mortification.
They rose in the night
to chant the divine Office, and divided
the day between labor and
prayer, only coming together for a
half-hour’s fraternal intercourse after
dinner and the evening collation.
Eymeric himself, at night,
sang the <i lang="fr">réveillè</i> in the streets of
Agen, awakening the echoes of the
night with a hoarse, lamentable
voice: “Prégats pous praubés
trépassats trépassados que Diou
lous perdounné!”&mdash;Pray for the
poor departed, that God may pardon
them all!</p>

<p>Eymeric was so scrupulous about
using the water of S. Caprais’ fountain
for profane purposes that, discovering
some plants that gave
indications of a source, he labored
for six months in excavating the
rock, till at length he came so suddenly
upon a spring that he was
deluged with its waters.</p>

<p>During the plague of 1628, and
at other times of public distress,
his heroic charity was so fully manifest
that he was regarded as a public
benefactor; and when he died,
the most distinguished people in
the vicinity came to testify their
veneration and regret.</p>

<p>The cells of the Hermitage continued,
however, to be peopled till
the great revolution, when the place
was once more profaned. But in
1846 a band of Spanish Carmelites
came to establish themselves on the
mount sanctified by the early martyrs.
Martyrs, too, of the soul are
they; for there is no martyrdom
more severe than the inward crucifixion
of those who, in the cloister,
offer themselves an unbloody sacrifice
to God for the sins of the world.
Some, who have not tried it, think
the monastic life to be one of ease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
and self-indulgence. But let them
seriously reflect on the “years of
solitary weariness, of hardship and
mortification, of wakeful scholarship,
of perpetual prayer, unvisited
by a softness or a joy beyond what
a bird, or a tree, or an unusually
blue sky may bring,” with no consolations
except those that spring
from unfaltering trust in Christ and
utter abandonment to his sweet
yoke, and they will see that, humanly
speaking, such a life is by no
means one of perfect ease.</p>

<p>On this new Carmel lived for
a time Père Hermann, the distinguished
musician, who was so miraculously
converted by the divine
manifestation in the Holy Eucharist,
and it was here he gave expression
to the ardor of his Oriental
nature in some of his glowing <cite>Cantiques
to Jésus-Hostie</cite>, worthy to be
sung by seraphim:</p>

<p>Agen is mentioned on every page
of the religious history of southern
France. In the IIId century we
find the confessors of the faith already
mentioned. Sixty years later
S. Phoebadus, a monk of Lerins
who became Bishop of Agen, defended
the integrity of the Catholic
faith against the Arians in an able
treatise. He was a friend of S.
Hilary of Poitiers and S. Ambrose
of Milan. St. Jerome speaks of
him as still living in the year 392:
“Vivit usque hodie decrepitâ senectute.”
In the time of the Visigoths
SS. Maurin and Vincent de
Liaroles upheld and strengthened
the faith in Novempopulania.</p>

<p>In feudal times the bishops of
Agen were high and puissant lords
who had the royal prerogative of
coining money by virtue of a privilege
conferred on them by the
Dukes of Aquitaine. The money
they issued was called <em>Moneta Arnaldina</em>,
or <em>Arnaudenses</em>, from Arnaud
de Boville, a member of the ducal
family, who was the first to enjoy
the right.</p>

<p>It was a bishop of Agen, of the
illustrious family Della Rovere that
gave two popes&mdash;Sixtus IV. and
Julius II.&mdash;to the church, who induced
Julius Cæsar Scaliger to accompany
him when he took possession
of his see. Scaliger’s romantic
passion for a young girl of the
place led him to settle here for life.
Not far from Agen may still be
seen the Château of Verona, which
he built on his wife’s land, and
named in honor of his ancestors of
Verona&mdash;the Della Scalas, whose
fine tombs are among the most interesting
objects in that city. This
château is in a charming valley.
It remained unaltered till about
forty years ago; but it is now modernized,
and therefore spoiled. The
oaks he planted are cut down, the
rustic fountain he christened Théocrène
is gone. Only two seats,
hewn out of calcareous rock, remain
in the grounds, where he once
gathered around him George Buchanan,
Muret, Thevius, and other
distinguished men of the day.
These seats are still known as the
Fauteuils de Scaliger.</p>

<p>The elder Scaliger was buried
in the church of the Augustinian
Friars, which being destroyed in
1792, his remains were removed by
friendly hands for preservation.
They have recently been placed at
the disposition of the city authorities,
who will probably erect some
testimonial to one who has given
additional celebrity to the place.
The last descendant of the Scaligers&mdash;Mlle.
Victoire de Lescale&mdash;died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
at Agen, January 25, 1853, at
the age of seventy-six years.</p>

<p>Agen figures also in the religious
troubles of the XVIth century, as
it was part of the appanage of Margaret
of Valois; but it generally remained
true to its early traditions.
Nérac, the seat of the Huguenot
court at one time, was too near
not to exert its influence. Then
came Calvin himself, when he leaped
from his window and fled from
Paris. Theodore Beza too resided
there for a time. They were protected
by Margaret of Navarre,
who gathered around her men jealous
of the influence of the clergy
and desirous themselves of ruling
over the minds of others. They
boldly ridiculed the religious orders,
and censured the morals of the
priesthood, though so many prelates
of the time were distinguished for
their holiness and ability. Nérac
has lost all taste for religious controversy
in these material days. It
has turned miller, and is only noted
for its past aberrations and the
present superiority of its flour.</p>

<p>On the other side of the Garonne,
towards the plain of Layrac, we
come to the old Château of Estillac,
associated with the memory of
Blaise de Monluc, the terrible avenger
of Huguenot atrocities in this
section of France. He was an off-shoot
of the noble family of Montesquiou,
and served under Bayard,
Lautrec, and Francis I.&mdash;a small,
thin, bilious-looking man, with an
eye as cold and hard as steel, and
a face horribly disfigured in battle,
before whom all parties quailed,
Catholic as well as Protestant. He
had the zeal of a Spaniard and the
bravado of a true Gascon; was
sober in his habits, uncompromising
in his nature, and, living in his
saddle, with rapier in hand, he was
always ready for any emergency,
to strike any blow; faithful to his
motto: “<i lang="la">Deo duce, ferro comite</i>.”</p>

<p>We are far from justifying the relentless
rigor of Monluc; but one
cannot travel through this country,
where at every step is some trace
of the fury with which the Huguenots
destroyed or desecrated everything
Catholics regard as holy,
without finding much to extenuate
his course. We must not forget
that the butchery which filled the
trenches of the Château de Penne
was preceded by the sack of Lauzerte,
where, according to Protestant
records, Duras slaughtered five
hundred and sixty-seven Catholics,
of whom one hundred and ninety-four
were priests; and that the
frightful massacre of Terraube was
provoked by the treachery of Bremond,
commander of the Huguenots
at the siege of Lectoure.</p>

<p>Among the other remarkable men
upon whose traces we here come is
Sulpicius Severus, a native of Agen.
His friend, S. Paulinus of Nola,
tells us he had a brilliant position
in the world, and was universally
applauded for his eloquence; but
converted in the very flower of his
life, he severed all human ties and
retired into solitude. He is said to
have founded the first monastery in
Aquitaine, supposed to be that of S.
Sever-Rustan, where he gave himself
up to literary labors that have
perpetuated his name. The Huguenots
burned down this interesting
monument of the past in 1573,
and massacred all the monks. It
was from the cloister of Primulacium,
as it was then called, that successively
issued his <cite>Ecclesiastical
History</cite>, which won for him the
title of the Christian Sallust; the
<cite>Life of S. Martin of Tours</cite>, written
from personal recollections;
and three interesting <cite>Dialogues on
the Monastic Life</cite>, all of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
were submitted to the indulgent
criticism of S. Paulinus before they
were given to the public. The intimacy
of these two great men probably
began when S. Paulinus lived
in his villa Hebromagus, on the
banks of the Baïse, and it was by
no means broken off by their separation.
The latter made every effort
to induce his friend to join him
at Nola; but we have no reason to
complain he did not succeed, for
this led to a delightful correspondence
we should be sorry to have
lost. We give one specimen of it,
in which modesty is at swords’
points with friendship. Sulpicius
had built a church at Primulacium,
and called upon his poet-friend to
supply him with inscriptions for
the walls. The baptistery contained
the portrait of S. Martin, and,
wishing to add that of Paulinus, he
ventured to ask him for it. Paulinus’
humility is alarmed, and he
flatly refuses; but he soon learns his
likeness has been painted from
memory, and is hanging next that
of the holy Bishop of Tours. He
loudly protests, but that is all he
can do, except avenge his outraged
humility by sending the following
inscription to be graven beneath
the two portraits: “You, whose
bodies and souls are purified in this
salutary bath, cast your eyes on the
two models set before you. Sinners,
behold Paulinus; ye just, look
at Martin. Martin is the model of
saints; Paulinus only that of the
guilty!”</p>

<p>Sometimes there is a dash of
pleasantry in their correspondence,
as when Paulinus sends for some
good Gascon qualified to be a cook
in his <i lang="la">laura</i>. Sulpicius despatches
Brother Victor with a letter of
recommendation which perhaps
brought a smile to his friend’s face:
“I have just learned that every
cook has taken flight from your
kitchen. I send you a young man
trained in our school, sufficiently
accomplished to serve up the humbler
vegetables with sauce and vinegar,
and concoct a modest stew that
may tempt the palates of hungry
cenobites; but I must confess he is
entirely ignorant of the use of spices
and all luxurious condiments, and
it is only right I should warn you
of one great fault: he is the mortal
enemy of a garden. If you be not
careful, he will make a frightful
havoc among all the vegetables he
can lay his hands on. He may seldom
call on you for wood, but he
will burn whatever comes within
his reach. He will even lay hold
of your rafters, and tear the old
joists from your chimneys.”</p>

<p>Among other Agen literary celebrities
is the poet Antoine de La
Pujade, who was secretary of finances
to Queen Margaret of Navarre&mdash;not
the accomplished, fascinating
sister of Francis I., but the wife of
the <i lang="fr">Vert-Galant</i>, “<i lang="fr">Du tige des Valois
belle et royale fleur</i>,” who encouraged
and applauded the poet,
and even addressed him flattering
verses. His tender, caressing lines
on the death of his little son of
four years of age are well known:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Petite âme mignonnelette,</div>
<div class="verse">Petite mignonne âmelette,</div>
<div class="verse">Hôtesse d’un si petit corps!</div>
<div class="verse">Petit mignon, mon petit Pierre,</div>
<div class="verse">Tu laisses ton corps à la terre,</div>
<div class="verse">Et ton âme s’en va dehors.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>La Pujade consecrated his pen
to the Blessed Virgin in the <cite>Mariade</cite>,
a poem of twelve cantos in
praise of the <i lang="fr">très sainte et très sacrée
Vierge Marie</i>.</p>

<p>Another rhymer of Agen, and a
courtier also, is Guillaume du Sable,
a Huguenot, who in his verses held
up his wife, his daughter, and his
son-in-law as utterly given up to
avarice. As for himself, he was always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
ready to spend! Yes, and as
ready to beg. That he was by no
means grasping, that his palms
never itched, is shown by his poems,
which are full of petitions to the
king for horses, clothes, and appointments.
Like so many of his
co-religionists, he did not disdain
the spoils of the enemy, as is apparent
from this modest request to
Henry IV.:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Mais voulez-vous guérir, Sire, ma pauvreté?</div>
<div class="verse">Donnez-moi, s’il vous plait, la petite abbaye,</div>
<div class="verse">Ou quelque prieuré le reste de ma vie,</div>
<div class="verse">Puisque je l’ai vouée à votre majesté.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He wrote against priests and
monks, but stuck to the royal party,
condemning all who revolted under
pretext of religion. Perhaps the
most supportable of his works is
that against the Spanish Inquisition&mdash;a
subject that never needs any
<i lang="fr">sauce piquante</i>. His <cite>Tragique Elégie
du jour de Saint Barthélemy</cite> affords
an additional proof in favor of the
approximate number of <em>one thousand</em>
victims at the deplorable massacre
of August 24, 1572.</p>

<p>As a proof of the tenacity with
which the Agenais have clung to
past religious traditions and customs,
we will cite the popular saying
that arose from the unusual dispensations
granted during Lent by
Mgr. Hébert, the bishop of the
diocese, in a time of great distress
after an unproductive year:</p>

<p>“En milo sept centz nau L’abesque
d’Agen debenguèt Higounau”&mdash;In
1709 the Bishop of Agen turned
Huguenot!</p>

<p>Leaving Agen by the railway to
Tarbes, we came in ten minutes to
Notre Dame de Bon Encontre&mdash;a
spot to which all the sorrows and
fears and hopes of the whole region
around are brought. This chapel
is especially frequented during the
month of May, when one parish after
another comes here to invoke
the protection of Mary. A continual
incense of prayer seems to rise
on the sacred air from this sweet
woodland spire. A few houses
cluster around the pretty church,
which is surmounted by a colossal
statue of the Virgin overlooking the
whole valley and flooding it with
peace, love, and boundless mercy.
The image of her who is so interwoven
with the great mysteries of
the redemption can never be looked
upon with indifference or without
profit. The soul that finds
Mary in the tangled grove of this
sad world enters upon a “moonlit
way of sweet security.”</p>

<p>We next pass Astaffort, a little
village perched on a hill overlooking
the river Gers, justifying its
ancient device: <i lang="la">Sta fortiter</i>.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> It
played an important part in the
civil wars of the country. The
Prince de Condé occupied the
place with four hundred men, and,
attacked by the royalists, they were
all slain but the prince and his
valet, who made their escape. A
cross marks the burial-place of the
dead behind the church of Astaffort,
still known as the field of the
Huguenots.</p>

<p>Lectoure, like an eagle’s nest
built on a cliff, is the next station,
and merits a short tarry; for, though
fallen from its ancient grandeur, it
is a town full of historic interest,
and contains many relics of the
past. It is a place mentioned by
Cæsar and Pliny, and yet so small
that we wonder what it has been
doing in the meantime. It was
one of the nine cities of Novempopulania,
and in the IXth century
still boasted the Roman franchise,
and was the centre of light and
legislation to the country around,
on which it imposed its customs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
and laws. It governed itself, lived
its own individual life, unaffected
by the changes of surrounding
provinces, and proudly styled itself
in its public documents “the Republic
of Lectoure.” In the XIIth
century it was the stronghold of
the Vicomtes de Lomagne; and
when Richard Cœur de Lion wished
to bring Vivian II. of that house
to terms, he laid siege to Lectoure,
which, though stoutly defended for
a time, was finally obliged to yield.
In 1305 it belonged to the family
of Bertrand de Got (Pope Clement
V.), which accounts for a bull of
his being dated at Lectoure. Count
John of Armagnac married Reine
de Got, the pope’s niece, in 1311,
and thus the city fell into the hands
of the haughty Armagnacs, who
made it their capital. At this time
they were the mightiest lords of
the South of France, and seemed to
have inherited the ancient glory of
the Counts of Toulouse. For a
time they held the destiny of
France itself in their hands. For
one hundred and fifty years they
took a prominent part in all the
French wars. Their banner, with
its lion rampant, floated on every
battle-field. Their war-cry&mdash;Armagnac!&mdash;resounded
in the ears of
the Derbys and Talbots. It was
an Armagnac that sustained the
courage of France after the surrender
of King John at Poitiers; an
Armagnac that united all the South
against the English in the Etats-Généraux
de Niort; and an Armagnac&mdash;Count
Bernard VI.&mdash;who
maintained the equilibrium of
France when Jean-sans-Peur of Burgundy
aimed at supremacy, and fell
a victim to Burgundian vengeance
at Paris.</p>

<p>Lectoure gives proofs of its antiquity
and the changes it has passed
through in the remains of its triple
wall; its fountain of Diana; the
bronzes, statuettes, jewels, and old
Roman votive altars, that are now
and then brought to light; its
mediæval castle, and the interesting
old church built by the English
during their occupancy, with its
massive square tower, whence we
look off over the valley of the Gers,
with its orchards and vineyards and
verdant meadows shut in by wooded
hills, and see stretching away to
the south the majestic outline of
the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>At the west of Lectoure is the
forest of Ramier, in the midst of
which once stood the Cistercian abbey
of Bouillas&mdash;Bernardus valles&mdash;founded
in 1125, but now entirely
destroyed.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">“Never was spot more sadly meet</div>
<div class="verse">For lonely prayer and hermit feet.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is a popular legend connected
with these woods, the truth
of which I do not vouch for&mdash;I tell
the tale as ’twas told to me:</p>

<p>A poor charcoal-burner, who
lived in this forest close by the
stream of Rieutort, had always
been strictly devout to God and the
blessed saints, but, on his deathbed,
in a moment of despair at
leaving his three motherless children
without a groat to bless themselves
with, invoked in their behalf
the foul spirit usually supposed to
hold dominion over the bowels of
the earth, with its countless mines
of silver and gold. He died, and
his three sons buried him beside
their mother in the graveyard of
Pauillac; but the wooden cross
they set up to mark the spot obstinately
refused to remain in the
ground. Terrified at this ominous
circumstance, the poor children
fled to their desolate cabin. The
night was dark and cold, and
wolves were howling in the forest.
“Brothers,” said the oldest, “we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
shall die of hunger and cold.
There is not a crumb of bread in
the house, and the doctor carried
off all our blankets yesterday for
his services. The Abbey of Bouillas
is only half a league off. I am
sure the good monks will not refuse
alms to my brother Juan.
And little Pierréto shall watch the
house while I go to the Castle of
Goas.”</p>

<p>Both brothers set off, leaving
Pierréto alone in the cabin. He
trembled with fear and the cold,
and at length the latter so far prevailed
that he ventured to the door
to see if he could not catch a
glimpse of his brothers on their way
home. It was now “the hour
when spirits have power.” Not a
hundred steps off he saw a group
of men dressed in rich attire, silently&mdash;“all
silent and all damned”&mdash;warming
themselves around a good
fire. The shivering child took
courage, and, drawing near the
band, begged for some coals to
light his fire. They assented, and
Pierréto hurriedly gathered up a
few and went away. But no sooner
had he re-entered the cabin
than they instantly went out. He
went the second time, and again
they were extinguished. The third
time the leader of the band frowned,
but gave him a large brand, and
threateningly told him not to come
again. The brand went out like
the coals; and the men and fire
disappeared as suddenly. Pierréto
remained half dead with fright. An
hour after Juan returned from the
Convent of Bouillas with bread
enough to last a week, and Simoun
soon arrived from the castle with
three warm blankets.</p>

<p>When daylight appeared, Pierréto
went to the fire-place to look at his
coals, and found they had all turned
to gold. The two oldest now
had the means of making their way
in the world. One became a brave
soldier, and the other a prosperous
merchant; but Pierro became a
brother in the Abbey of Bouillas.
Night after night, as he paced the
dark cloisters praying for his father’s
soul, he heard a strange rushing
as of fierce wind through the
arches, and a wailing sound as sad
as the <cite>Miserere</cite>. Pierro shuddered
and thought of the cross that refused
to darken his father’s grave; but
he only prayed the longer and the
more earnestly.</p>

<p>Years passed away. Simoun and
Juan, who had never married,
weary of honors and gain, came to
join their brother in his holy retreat.
Their wealth, that had so
mysterious an origin, was given to
God in the person of the poor.
Then only did the troubled soul of
their father find rest, and the holy
cross consent to throw its shadow
across his humble grave.</p>

<p>Lectoure is surrounded by ramparts;
but the most remarkable of
its ancient defences is the old castle
of the Counts of Armagnac, converted
into a hospital by the Bishop
of Lectoure in the XVIIIth century.
This castle witnessed the
shameless crimes of Count John
IV. and their fearful retribution at
the taking of Lectoure under Louis
XI. The tragical history of this
great lord affords a new proof of
the salutary authority exercised by
the church over brutal power and
unrestrained passion during the
Middle Ages.</p>

<p>There is no more striking example
of the degradation of an illustrious
race than that of John V., the last
Count of Armagnac, who shocked
the whole Christian world by an
unheard-of scandal. Having solicited
in vain a dispensation to marry
his sister Isabella, who was famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
for her beauty, he made use
of a pretended license, fraudulently
drawn up in the very shadow of the
papal court, as some say, to allay
Isabella’s scruples, and celebrated
this monstrous union with the
greatest pomp. He forgot, in the
intoxication of power and the delirium
of passion, there could be any
restraint on his wishes, that there
was a higher tribunal which watched
vigilantly over the infractions
of the unchangeable laws of morality
and religion. The pope fulminated
a terrible excommunication
against them. King Charles
VII., hoping to wipe out so fearful
a stain by the sacred influences of
family affection, sent the most influential
members of the count’s
family to exert their authority;
but in vain. The king soon turned
against him, because he favored
the revolt of the Dauphin, and sent
an army to invade his territory.
Count John’s only fear was of losing
Isabella; and rather than separate
from her to fight for the defence
of his domains, he fled with her to
the valley of Aure, while the royal
army ravaged his lands.</p>

<p>Condemned to perpetual banishment,
deprived of his dominions,
his power gone, under the ban of
the church, his eyes were opened
to the extent of his degradation,
his soul was filled with remorse.
He took the pilgrim’s staff and set
out for Rome, begging his bread by
the way, to seek absolution for himself
and his sister. Isabella retired
from the world to do penance for
her sins in the Monastery of Mount
Sion at Barcelona. The church,
which never spurns the repentant
sinner, however stained with crime,
granted him absolution on very
severe conditions. The learned
Æneas Sylvius (Pius II.) occupied
the chair of S. Peter at that time.
His great heart was touched by the
heroic penance of so great a lord.
He received him kindly, dwelt on
the enormity of the scandal he had
given to the world, and reminded
him that Pope Zachary had condemned
a man, guilty of an offence
of the same nature, to go on a
round of pilgrimages for fourteen
years, the first seven of which he
was ordered to wear an iron chain
attached to his neck or wrist,
fast three times a week, and only
drink wine on Sundays; but the
last seven he was only required to
fast on Fridays; after which he
was admitted to Communion.</p>

<p>More merciful, Pius II. enjoined
on Count John never to hold any
communication with Isabella by
word, letter, or message; to distribute
three thousand gold crowns
for the reparation of churches and
monasteries; and to fast every Friday
on bread and water till he could
take up arms against the Turks;
all of which the count solemnly
promised to do. Nor do we read
he ever violated his word. Affected
by such an example of penitence,
the pope addressed Charles VII. a
touching brief to induce him to
pardon the count.</p>

<p>When Louis XI. came to the
throne, remembering the services
he had received from Count John,
he restored him to his rank. The
count now married a daughter of
the house of Foix. Everything
seemed repaired. But divine justice
is not satisfied. Louis XI., determined
to destroy the almost
sovereign power of the great vassals,
took advantage of Count John’s
offences against his government,
and resolved on his destruction.
He sent an army to besiege him at
Lectoure. At this siege Isabella’s
son made his first essay at arms,
and displayed the valor of his race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
but the young hero finally perished
in a rash sortie, and the count soon
after capitulated. The royal forces,
taking possession of the place, basely
violated the terms of surrender.
The city was sacked and nearly all
the inhabitants massacred. Among
the victims was Count John himself,
who died invoking the Virgin.
The walls of the city were partly
demolished, and fire set to the four
quarters. The dead were left unburied,
and for two months the
wolves that preyed thereon were
the only occupants of the place.
Never was there a more fearful retribution.
It took the city nearly
a century to recover in a measure
from this horrible calamity.</p>

<p>Lectoure was in the hands of the
Huguenots when Monluc laid siege
to it in 1562. Bremond, the commander,
offered to capitulate, and,
proposing an exchange of hostages,
he asked for Verduzan, La Chapelie,
and a third. Monluc consented,
and as they approached the gates
of the city they were fired upon by
thirty or forty arquebusiers, but
without effect. Monluc cried out
that was not the fidelity of an honest
man, but of a Huguenot. Bremond
protested his innocence of
the deed, and, pretending to seize
one of the guilty men, he hung an
innocent Catholic on the walls in
sight of Monluc. Unaware of the
fraud, the hostages again approached,
and again they were fired upon.
A gentleman from Agen was killed
and others wounded. Indignant
at such treachery, and supposing
his own life particularly aimed at,
Monluc exclaimed that, since they
held their promises so lightly, he
would do the same with his, and he
immediately sent Verduzan with a
company of soldiers to Terraube to
despatch the prisoners whose lives
he had spared. This order was
executed with as much exactness
as barbarity, and the implacable
Monluc declared he had made “a
fine end of some very bad fellows.”</p>

<p>Bremond, urged by the inhabitants,
again renewed negotiations,
and finally surrendered the city on
condition of being allowed to withdraw
with his troops to Bearn, flags
flying and drums beating, and the
Protestants left in the place permitted
the free exercise of their religion&mdash;terms
that were faithfully
kept by Monluc.</p>

<p>It was probably the sympathy of
Lectoure with the Huguenot party
that led Charles IX. to deprive it
of many of its ancient rights and
privileges, which hastened its decline.
It put on a semblance of its
former grandeur, however, when it
received Henry IV. within its walls,
and Anne of Austria with Cardinal
Richelieu.</p>

<p>It was in the old historic castle
that Richelieu imprisoned the unfortunate
Duc de Montmorency.
The people favored his escape, and
sent him a silk ladder in a <i lang="fr">pâté</i>; but
his kindness of heart led to his destruction.
Desirous of saving a
servant to whom he was attached,
he took him with him in his attempt
to escape. The servant fell from
the ladder, and was wounded. His
cry aroused the guard. Montmorency
was taken and soon after beheaded
at Toulouse. The soldiers
present at his execution drank
some of his blood, that, infused into
their veins, it might impart something
of the valor of so brave a
man. He was so beloved by the
common people that the peasantry
of Castelnaudry, where he was taken
prisoner, are familiar with his history,
and speak of him with admiration
and affection to this day. His
wife, an Italian princess, became a
Visitandine nun after his execution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>One cannot visit the old castle
of Lectoure, with its thousand
memories, without emotion. It is
now a hospital. Charity has taken
the place of brutality and lawless
passion. Looking off from the
walls over the pleasant valley below,
watered by streams and divided by
long lines of trees, we hear the song
of the peaceful laborer instead of
the battle-cry of the olden time,
and the lowing of the fawn-colored
Gascon cattle instead of the neighing
of war-horses.</p>

<p>Before the castle opens a street
that goes straight through the town,
at the further end of which is the
parish church of S. Gervais, a fine,
spacious edifice of the Saxo-Gothic
style, built by the English during
their rule. The immense square
tower was once a fortress, called
the tower of S. Thomas, from which
the sentinel signalled the approach
of the enemy. It was formerly surmounted
by the highest steeple in
France, but, repeatedly struck by
lightning, it was taken down some
years ago by order of the bishop.</p>

<p>The Carmelite nuns at Lectoure
have had from time immemorial a
cross of marvellous efficacy, especially
in cases of fever. It is of a
style not often met with in France,
though common in Spain, where it
is held in great veneration from its
miraculous prototype&mdash;the Santa
Cruz de Caravaca.</p>

<p>This cross is made of copper, and
has two cross-beams, like a patriarchal
cross, with figures in relief on
each side, which are connected
with an interesting history. On
the top of one side of the cross is
the monogram of Christ, with a
crosslet above and the three nails
of the Passion below. The upper
cross-beam has a chalice on the left
arm, and on the right the lance
that pierced the Sacred Heart,
crossed by a reed with a sponge at
the end. In the middle is an open
space for relics.</p>

<p>On the left arm of the lower cross-beam
is the scourge and the lantern
that lit the soldiers to the Garden
of Olives; on the right is a ladder;
and in the centre the cock crowing
on a pillar that extends up from
the foot of the cross, at which is a
death’s head.</p>

<p>These are the usual emblems of
the Passion, familiar to all; but the
other side is more mysterious. On
the upper part is a patriarchal cross
supported by two angels, one on
each arm of the upper cross-beam.
Lower down, in the centre of the
lower cross-beam, is a priest in
sacerdotal vestments, ready to offer
the Holy Sacrifice, standing in an
attitude of astonishment and admiration,
looking up at the cross
borne by the two angels. On his
breast is the monogram of Christ,
and beneath that of the Virgin.
On each side are lilies in full bloom,
and above his head, in the centre
of the upper cross-beam, stands a
chalice, as on an altar, covered
with the sacred linen veil. It is
evident the artist intended to represent
all the objects necessary to
celebrate the Holy Sacrifice of the
Mass. There are two lighted
candles at the side of the priest,
and at the end of the right arm of
the lower cross-beam are two kings
filled with evident amazement, one
of whom is gazing at the angelic
apparition. At the left extremity
is a queen and an attendant.</p>

<p>The Cross of Caravaca is associated
with a chivalric legend of
southern Spain. We give it as related
by Juan de Robles, a priest
of Caravaca, whose account was
published at Madrid in 1615.</p>

<p>About the year of our Lord 1227
there reigned at Valencia a Moorish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
prince, known in the ancient Spanish
chronicles by the Arabic name
of Zeyt Abuzeyt, who embraced
Christianity. According to Zurita,
he became King of Murcia and
Valencia in 1224, and was at first a
violent persecutor of his Christian
subjects. In 1225 he made peace
with Iago, King of Aragon, promising
him one-fifth of the revenues
of his two capitals, which enraged
his people and caused him the loss
of Murcia. The Moors, discovering
he held secret intercourse with
the King of Aragon and the pope,
drove him from Valencia in 1229.
He died about 1248, before King
Iago took possession of that city.</p>

<p>Zeyt Abuzeyt’s conversion to
Christianity took place in consequence
of a miracle that occurred
in his presence at Caravaca, a town
in his kingdom where he happened
to be. At that time the Spanish
victories over the Moors announced
the speedy expulsion of the latter
from the Peninsula, and frequent
conversions took place among them.
A Christian priest ventured among
the Moors of the kingdom of Murcia
to preach the Gospel. He was seized
and brought before Zeyt Abuzeyt,
who asked him many questions
concerning the Christian religion,
and, in particular, about the Sacrifice
of the Mass. The explanations
of the priest interested him so much
that he requested him to celebrate
the Holy Mysteries in his presence.
The priest, not having the necessary
articles, sent for them to the
town of Concha, which was in the
hands of the Christians; but it happened
that the cross, which should
always be on the altar during the
celebration of Mass, had been forgotten.
The priest, not remarking
the deficiency, began the Holy Sacrifice,
but, soon observing the cross
was wanting, did not know what to
do. The king, who was present
with his family and the court, seeing
the priest suddenly turn pale,
asked what had happened. “There
is no cross on the altar,” replied
the priest. “But is not that one?”
replied the king, who at that moment
saw two angels placing a
cross on the altar. The good priest
joyfully gave thanks to God and
continued the sacred rites. So
marvellous an occurrence triumphed
over the infidelity of Zeyt Abuzeyt,
and he at once professed his
faith in Christ. Popular tradition
says he was baptized by the name
of Ferdinand, in honor of the holy
king, Ferdinand III., who stood as
sponsor. Pope Urban IV. addressed
him a brief of felicitation on account
of his baptism.</p>

<p>Zeyt Abuzeyt had one son, who
received the name of Vincent when
baptized, and subsequently married
a Christian maiden. At the death
of his father he took the title of
the King of Valencia, which he held
till the King of Aragon took possession
of the city. He then contented
himself with the lands and revenues
assigned him by the conqueror.</p>

<p>This account explains the figures
on the Cross of Caravaca. We see
the astonished priest and the cross
borne by the angels. The two kings,
who are gazing at the cross, are of
course King Zeyt Abuzeyt and S.
Ferdinand, his god-father. The
queen opposite is doubtless Dominica
Lopez, whom, according to tradition,
he married after his baptism;
and beside her is her daughter,
called Aldea Fernandez in honor
of King Ferdinand.</p>

<p>This cross, to which a great number
of miracles are attributed, is
preserved with great care in the
church at Caravaca, in the ancient
kingdom of Murcia. It is believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
to be made of the sacred wood
of the true cross. A great number
of similar crosses have since been
made, and there is hardly a family
in Spain which has not a Cross of
Caravaca. Many people wear one.</p>

<p>S. Teresa had great devotion to
this cross, and her cross of Caravaca
fell into the possession of the
Carmelites of Brussels, who gave it
to the monastery of S. Denis during
the time of Mme. Louise of France;
but this precious relic has since
been restored to the convent at
Brussels.</p>

<p>On an eminence in sight of Lectoure
is one of the sanctuaries of
mysterious origin dear to popular
piety, so numerous in this country.
It is Notre Dame d’Esclaux. Its
modest tower looks down on a secluded
valley which delights the
eye with its freshness and fertility,
its fine trees, and the sparkling
streams here and there among the
verdure. Beyond are fertile heights
in the direction of Nérac. The
origin of this church is somewhat
obscure. Old traditions tell of
oxen kneeling in a thicket in the
meadow belonging to the lord of S.
Mézard. The shepherds, attracted
by the circumstance, found a statue
of Our Lady buried in the ground.
There are many instances of similar
discoveries in this region. The
animals that witnessed the Nativity
have always had a certain sacredness
in the eyes of the people, and
they have part in many an ancient
legend, like that in which they are
made to kneel at the midnight
hour at Christmas. The lord of
the manor built a chapel for the
wondrous image, and a fountain
soon after sprang up, which to this
day is celebrated for its miraculous
virtues. The most ancient
document concerning this chapel
bears the date of April 23, 1626,
stating it had been destroyed by
the Huguenots during the religious
wars, and owed its restoration to
the piety of the noble family who,
according to tradition, first founded
it. The concourse of pilgrims
has not ceased for three centuries.
Whole parishes come here in procession
in perpetual remembrance
of some great benefit. The parish
of Pergain has not failed to make
its annual pilgrimage for two hundred
years in fulfilment of a vow
made to avert the divine wrath
after a fearful hail-storm that had
ravaged its lands. Only a few of
the wonders wrought in this sanctuary
have been recorded. We find
a striking one, however, in the beginning
of last century. A little
boy of seven years of age, who had
never walked in his life and had no
use whatever of his feet, was taken
by his pious parents to Notre
Dame d’Esclaux, where Mass was
said for his benefit. At the moment
of the Elevation the little cripple
rose without assistance, and went
up to the railing of the chancel,
and afterwards walked home to La
Romieu, a distance of about six
miles. He always celebrated the
anniversary of his miraculous cure
with pious gratitude, and his descendants
have continued to do the
same to this day. The details of
this wonderful occurrence have
been furnished by M. Lavardens,
the present head of the family, one
of the most respectable in the region.</p>

<p>A path leads the devout pilgrim
up the sad way of the cross to the
summit of the hill, where stands a
large crucifix, in which is enshrined
a relic of the true cross. We loved
to see these heights consecrated
to religion with the sign of the
Passion&mdash;emblem of the triumph
of moral liberty.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes’ walk to the south
of Lectoure brings you to the Chapel
of S. Geny, on the banks of the
Gers. Behind it rises the mount
on whose summit this saint of the
early times was wont to pray.
Here he was when thirty soldiers,
sent by the Roman governor in
pursuit of him, appeared on the
other side of the Gers. S. Geny
lifted up his clean hands and pure
heart to heaven. The hill trembled
beneath his knees. The river
rose so high that for two days
the amazed soldiers were unable to
cross, and then it was to throw
themselves at the saint’s feet and
acknowledge the power of the true
God. They received baptism, and
were soon after martyred in a
place long known as the “Blood of
the Innocents.” A new band being
sent against S. Geny, he again ascends
the mount, but this time to
pray his soul may be received
among those whose robes have just
been washed white in the blood
of the Lamb. And while he was
praying with eyes uplifted the
heavens opened, he saw the newly-crowned
martyrs, encircled with rejoicing
angels, chanting: Let those
who have overcome the adversary
and kept their garments undefiled
have their names written in the
Lamb’s book of life! At this
sight the saint’s knees bend, his
ravished soul breaks loose from its
bonds and takes flight for heaven.
This was on the 3d of May. His
body remained on the top of the
mount, giving out an odor of mysterious
sweetness, till the Bishop of
Lectoure brought it down to the
foot of the hill, and buried it in
the little church S. Geny had erected
over his mother’s tomb. Not
long after two persons, overtaken
by darkness, sought refuge in this
oratory, and found it filled with a
great light and embalmed with lilies
and roses&mdash;beautiful emblems
of the supernatural love and purity
that had distinguished the saint.</p>

<p>Not far from Lectoure was once
another “devout chapel,” one of
the most noted in the country
around&mdash;Notre Dame de Protection,
in the village of Tudet, a
place of pilgrimage as far back as
the XIIth century. The Madonna
has a miraculous origin, like so
many others in this “Land of
Mary.” According to the old
legend, it was discovered by shepherds
in a fountain at which an ox
had refused to drink. The statue
was set up beside the spring, and
became a special object of devotion
to the neighborhood and a source
of many supernatural favors.
Vivian II., Vicomte de Lomagne,
in gratitude for personal benefits
received, built a chapel for the reception
of the statue in 1178, but,
as it proved too small for the numerous
votaries, Henry II. of England,
a few years after, erected a
large church adjoining Vivian’s
chapel, with a hospice, served by
monks, for the accommodation of
pilgrims. All over the neighboring
hills rose little cells inhabited
by hermits drawn to this favored
spot from the remotest parts of
southern France. Not only the
common people, but the nobles
and renowned warriors of the Middle
Ages, and even the kings of
France, came here to implore the
protection of the Virgin. Every
year, at spring-time, came the inhabitants
of Lectoure, Fleurance,
and all the neighboring parishes,
often fourteen or fifteen at a time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
accompanied by priests in their
robes and magistrates in red official
garments, chanting hymns in
honor of Mary. Countless miracles
were wrought at her altar.
The walls were covered with
crutches and <i lang="la">ex votos</i>. One of the
fathers of Tudet writes thus at the
close of last century: “Here
Mary may be said to manifest her
power and goodness in a special
manner. How many times has she
not caused the paralytic to walk,
cured the epileptic, given sight to
the blind, hearing to the deaf, and
speech to the dumb! How often
has she not healed the sick at the
very gates of death, snatched people
from destruction at the very
moment of danger, and put an end
to hail-storms, tempests, and the
plague!”</p>

<p>Nothing enrages the impious so
much as the evidences of a piety
that is a constant reproach to their
lives; and the Revolution of 1793
swept away, not only the ancient
chapel of the Viscounts of Lomagne,
but the church of Henry II.,
the hospice, and the hermits’ cells,
leaving only a few broken arches
where now and then a solitary pilgrim
went to pray. The miraculous
statue, however, was rescued
from profanation, and for a long
time buried in the ground. It is
still honored in the village church
of Gaudonville, but it is only a mutilated
trunk, its head and most of
the limbs being gone. So many
holy recollections, however, are associated
with it, that people still
gather around it to pray, especially
in harvest-time, to be spared the
ravages of hail, often so destructive
in this region.</p>

<p>Some of the old hymns in the expressive
Gascon tongue, as sung at
Notre Dame de Protection, are still
extant, and nothing is more pathetic
than to see a group of hard-working
peasants around the altar
of the chapel of Gaudonville singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Jésus, bous aouets tribaillat</div>
<div class="verse">Prenéts noste tribail en grat!”<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Among other prayers they chant
is a rhymed litany of twenty-seven
saints of different trades, and twenty-one
shepherd saints, with an appropriate
invocation to each, not
exactly poetical, but, sung by the
uncultivated voices of poor laborers
in that rustic chapel in a measured
mournful cadence, there is
something akin to poesy&mdash;something
higher&mdash;which awakens profound
and salutary thoughts. It is
in this way they invoke S. Spiridion,
the reaper; S. Auber, the
laborer in the vineyard; S. Isidore,
the gardener:</p>

<p>“Sent Isidore, qui ets estats
Coum nous au tribail occupat,” etc.&mdash;S.
Isidore, who wast like us in labor
occupied, etc.&mdash;a touching appeal
for sympathy to that unseen
world of saints of every tribe and
tongue and degree, which excludes
not the highest, and admits the
lowest.</p>

<p>The Church of Notre Dame de
Tudet is about to be rebuilt. The
corner-stone was laid a short time
since on the feast of Our Lady of
Protection, under the patronage of
the pious descendants of the ancient
Viscounts of Lomagne, true to the
traditions of their race. The entire
population of fourteen neighboring
villages assembled to witness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
the solemn ceremony and pray in
a spot so venerated by their ancestors.
The mutilated statue of Gaudonville
is to be restored, and
brought back in triumph to the
place where it was once so honored.
Thus all through France there is a
singular revival of devotion to the
venerable sanctuaries of the Middle
Ages. Everywhere they are being
repaired or rebuilt&mdash;a significant
fact of good augury for the church.</p>

<h3>BROTHER PHILIP.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></h3>

<p>The century in which we live
has distinguished itself by a terrible
propaganda of evil, error and corruption
taking every variety of
form to insinuate themselves into
society; yet this same century is
also marked by great and generous
efforts in the cause of truth and
goodness, and in these France has
proved herself true to her ancient
vocation. From a peculiar vivacity
of energy (if we may be allowed
the expression) in the national
character, whether for good or for
evil, the land that has produced
some of the most hardened atheists,
the worst and wildest communists,
and the most frivolous votaries of
pleasure, continues to produce the
most numerous and devoted missionaries,
the readiest martyrs, and
saints whose long lives of hidden
toil for God and his church are a
noble pendant to her martyrs’
deaths.</p>

<p>One of these lives of unobtrusive
toil is now before us&mdash;that of Brother
Philip, who during thirty-five
years was Superior-General of the
Frères des Ecoles Chrétiennes, or
Brothers of the Christian Schools.
Before tracing it, even in the imperfect
manner which is all for
which we have space, it will be well
to give a brief sketch of the institute
of which he was for so long the
honored head.</p>

<p>Jean Baptiste de la Salle, the son
of noble parents, was born at
Rheims in the year 1651. Entering
Holy Orders early in life, he
greatly distinguished himself in the
priesthood, not only as a scholar
and theologian, but also as an
orator, so eloquent and persuasive
that he might have aspired to the
highest dignities in the church had
he not chosen to limit his ambition
to the lowly work of popular education.
This education was not then
in existence. Not that there was an
utter absence of schools, but these
were all unconnected with each
other, and were besides greatly
wanting in any good and efficient
method of teaching. The Abbé de
la Salle invented the simultaneous
method, namely, that which consists
in giving lessons to a whole class at
a time, instead of to each child
separately. The subjects of instruction
were reading, writing, French
grammar, arithmetic, and geometry,
with Christian teaching as the basis
and invariable accompaniment of
all the rest. He founded an association<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
of religious who were not to
enter the priesthood, of which, however,
they were to become the most
efficient allies in the education of
the young according to the mind of
the church, this intention being
their distinguishing characteristic.
Resolving to live in community
with them, he resigned his canonry
at Rheims, and sold his rich patrimony,
distributing the money
among the poor. He gave the
brethren their rule, and also the
habit which they wear. Thus a
new religious family, not ecclesiastical,
appeared in France, the members
of which were only to be brothers,
united by the vows of poverty,
chastity, and obedience. The Abbé
de la Salle also established a
school for training teachers, which
was the first normal school ever
founded in France; he also originated
Sunday-schools for the young
apprentices of different trades, and
<i lang="fr">pensionnats</i>, or boarding-schools, the
first of which was opened at Paris,
for the Irish youths protected by
James II. of England, and fugitives
like himself.</p>

<p>The chief house of the order was
St. Yon (formerly Hauteville), an
ancient manor just outside the
gates of Rouen, surrounded by an
extensive enclosure, and affording a
peaceful solitude where M. de la
Salle enjoyed his few brief intervals
of repose in this world. He had
been invited to settle there by Mgr.
Colbert, Archbishop of Rouen, and
M. de Pontcarré, First President of
the Parliament of Normandy, and,
after the death of Louis XIV., made
it more and more the centre of his
work. It was at St. Yon that he
resigned the post of superior-general
in 1716, and there he died on
Good Friday, the 7th of April, 1719,
aged sixty-eight years. The house
was soon afterwards enlarged and a
church built, to which in 1734 the
Brothers transferred the remains of
their holy founder, which had until
then rested in the Church of S.
Sever.</p>

<p>The Brothers of the Christian
Schools were called the Brothers
of St. Yon, and sometimes les
Frères Yontains, whence originated
the title of Frères Ignorantins,
which has, however, been <em>lived down</em>
by the institute, the excellence of
the instruction afforded by the
Christian Schools not permitting
the perpetuation of the derisive
epithet.</p>

<p>The new order supplied a want
too generally felt not to extend
itself rapidly, and at the time of
the Abbé de la Salle’s death it
numbered twenty-seven houses, two-hundred
and seventy-four Brothers,
and nine thousand eight hundred and
eighty-five pupils. In 1724 Louis
XV. granted it letters-patent expressive
of his approval, and it was
in the same year that Pope Benedict
XIII. accorded canonical institution
to the congregation, thus
realizing the earnest desire of the
venerable founder, that his institute
should be recognized by the Sovereign
Pontiff as a religious order,
with a distinctive character and
special constitutions. Brother Timothy
was at that time superior-general.
He governed the institute
with energy and wisdom for
thirty-one years, during which time
no less than seventy additional
houses of the order were established
in various of the principal towns
of France, everywhere meeting with
encouragement and protection from
the bishops and the Christian nobility,
so that every inauguration
of a school was made an occasion
of rejoicing.</p>

<p>The successor of Brother Timothy
was Brother Claude, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
superior-general from 1751 to 1767,
when, having attained the age of
seventy-seven, he resigned his office,
continuing to live eight years longer
in the house of St. Yon, where he
died. It was at this period that the
atheism of the XVIIIth century was
making its worst ravages. A band
of writers, under the leadership of
Voltaire, laid siege, as it were, to
Christianity, by a regular plan of
attack, and, employing as their
weapons a false and superficial
philosophy, distorted history, raillery,
ridicule, corruption, and lies,
they conspired against the truth,
while licentiousness of mind and
manners infected society and literature
alike. At the very time
when the followers of the faith
were devoting themselves with renewed
energy to the instruction
of the ignorant and the succor of
the needy, philosophy, so-called,
by the pen of Voltaire, wrote as
follows:</p>

<p>“The people are only fit to be
directed, not instructed; they are
not worth the trouble.”<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>“It appears to me absolutely
essential that there should be ignorant
beggars. It is the towns-people
(<i lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>) only, not the working-classes,
who ought to be
taught.”<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>“The common people are like
oxen: the goad, the yoke, and fodder
are enough for <em>them</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Thus
contemptuously were the people
regarded by anti-Christian philosophy,
which, while it paid court to
any form of earthly power, perpetuated,
and even outdid, the traditions
of pagan antiquity in its hardness
and disdain towards the lower
orders.</p>

<p>On the retirement of Brother
Claude, Brother Florentius accepted,
in 1777, the direction of the
house at Avignon, where the storm
of Revolution burst upon him. After
undergoing imprisonment and
every kind of insulting and cruel
treatment he died a holy death, in
1800, when order was beginning to
be restored to France.</p>

<p>Brother Agathon, who next ruled
the congregation, was a man of high
culture in special lines of study, of
wise discernment regarding the interests
and requirements of the religious
life, and of rare capacity as
an administrator. The circular-addresses
he issued from time to
time have never lost their authority
with the Brothers, and furnish a
supplement as well as a commentary
to the rule of their institute. He
did much to increase the extent
and efficiency of the latter, but was
interrupted in the midst of his work
by the political disturbances that
were agitating his country. The decree
of the 13th of February, 1790,
by which “all orders and congregations,
whether of men or women,”
were suppressed, did not immediately
overthrow the institute; but, although
it suffered the provisional
existence of such associations as
were charged with public instruction
or attendance on the sick, the
respite was to be of short duration.
The Brothers, however, notwithstanding
the anxiety into which
they were thrown by the decree of
the Constitutional Assembly, ventured
to hope that their society
would be spared on account of its
known devotedness to the interests
of the people. Brother Agathon,
moreover, was not a man who
would silently submit to unjust
measures, and several petitions were
addressed by him to the Assembly,
in which he fearlessly pleaded the
cause of his institute, on the ground
of its acknowledged utility among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
the very classes whose benefit the
Assembly professed to have so greatly
at heart. The simple and conclusive
reasoning of these petitions
must have gained their cause with
reason and justice; but reason and
justice were alike dethroned in
France. One member alone of the
Assembly did himself honor by representing
the excellence of their
teaching and the reality of their
patriotism, but he spoke in vain;
and on the universal refusal of the
Brothers to take the oath imposed
by the civil constitution on the
members of any religious society, as
well as on those of the priesthood,
the houses to which they belonged
were summarily suppressed. They
were abused for not sending their
pupils to attend the religious ceremonies
presided over by schismatic
ministers; they were accused of
storing arms in their houses to be
used against the country; they
were charged with monopolizing
and concealing victuals; but after
a visit of inspection at Melun the
municipal officers were compelled
to bear testimony to the disinterested
probity of these pious teachers,
and similar perquisitions invariably
resulted in the confusion of their
calumniators.</p>

<p>But the Revolution continued its
course. A decree passed on the
18th of August, 1792, suppressed
all “secular ecclesiastical corporations”
and lay associations, “such
as that of the Christian Schools,”
it being alleged that “a state truly
free ought not to suffer the existence
in its bosom of any corporation
whatsoever, not even those
which, being devoted to public instruction,
have deserved well of the
country.”</p>

<p>The Reign of Terror had begun;
the dungeons were filling, and the
prison was but the threshold to the
scaffold. The children of the venerable
De la Salle were not spared.
Brother Solomon, secretary to the
superior-general, was martyred on
the 2d of September for refusing
to take the schismatic oath. Brother
Abraham was on the very
point of being guillotined when he
was rescued by one of the National
Guard. The Brothers of the house
in the Rue de Notre Dame des
Champs continued to keep the
schools of S. Sulpice until the massacre
of the Carmelite monks. Several
of the Brothers were put to
death. The courageous words of
Brother Martin before the revolutionary
tribunal at Avignon have
been preserved. “I am a teacher
devoted to the education of the
children of the poor,” he said to
his judges; “and if your protestations
of attachment to the people
are sincere; if your principles of
fraternity are anything better than
mere forms of speech, my functions
not only justify me, but claim your
thanks.” Language like this ensured
sentence of death. Besides,
at that time they condemned; they
did not judge.</p>

<p>After eighteen months of imprisonment
Brother Agathon was restored
to liberty, and died in 1797,
at Tours, leaving his institute dispersed;
but consoled by the last
sacraments, which he received in
secret.</p>

<p>Among the scattered members
of a congregation too Christian not
to be persecuted in those days we
do not find one who did not remain
faithful. Many of them, in the
name and dress of civilians, continued
to occupy themselves in teaching,
and filled the post of schoolmasters
at Noyon, Chartres, Laon,
Fontainebleau, etc. From the municipal
authorities of Laon they received
a public testimonial of esteem;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
and in 1797, being imprisoned
on the denunciation of a schismatic
priest, the Brothers were set
at liberty by a grateful and avenging
ebullition on the part of the
mothers of families. Their exit from
prison was a triumph, the population
crowding to meet them and
throwing flowers in their way until
they reached the school-house, in
the court of which a banquet had
been prepared, at which masters
and scholars found themselves happily
reunited.</p>

<p>In spite of the decree which had
smitten their institute, the Brothers
were still sought after as teachers
in purely civil conditions. Nothing
had replaced the orders and establishments
which had been destroyed;
no instruction was provided for the
young; and as the churches were
still closed and the pulpits silent,
a night of ignorance was beginning
to spread itself over the rising generation.
On the 25th of August,
1792, a boy demanded of the National
Assembly, for himself and his
comrades, that they should be “instructed
in the principles of equality
and the rights of man, instead
of being preached to in the name
of a so-called God.”</p>

<p>Such men as Daunou, Desmolières,
and Chaptal were deploring
the state of public instruction in
France, which during ten years had
been a mere mixture of absurdities
and frivolities, when Portalis dared
to declare openly that “religion
must be made the basis of education.”</p>

<p>This was in 1802, about the time
that the relations of France with
the Sovereign Pontiff were renewed
by the Concordat, and the three
consuls had gone together in state
to the metropolitan church of Notre
Dame. By the consular law of the
1st of May, 1802, on public instruction,
the Brothers were authorized
to resume their functions. The
institute no longer possessed any
houses in France, but a few remained
to it in Italy, and over these
Pope Pius VI. had appointed, as
vicar-general, Brother Frumentius,
director of the house of San Salvatore
at Rome.</p>

<p>Lyons was the first city in France
where the members of the scattered
congregation began to reassemble;
Paris was the next; then St. Germain
en Laye, Toulouse, Valence, Soissons,
and Rheims. The Brothers at
Lyons&mdash;namely, Brother Frumentius
and three companions&mdash;received,
in 1805, a memorable visit. Pope
Pius VII., in quitting France, after
having crowned at Notre Dame the
emperor by whom, three years later,
he himself was to be discrowned,
repaired, accompanied by three
cardinals, to the Brothers of the
Christian Schools. He blessed the
restored chapel and the reviving
institute, his fatherly words of encouragement
being a pledge and
promise of its beneficent prosperity.</p>

<p>As it was of importance that the
dispersed members should be made
aware of the reorganization of their
society, an earnest and affectionate
circular-letter was addressed to
them by Cardinal Fesch, archbishop
of Lyons, inviting them to repair
to Brother Frumentius to be employed
according to the rule of
their congregation, towards which
he at the same time assured them
of the emperor’s good-will.</p>

<p>The decree for the organization
of the University, issued on the 17th
of March, 1808, restored to the institute
a legal existence, together
with all the civil rights attached
to establishments of public utility.
In these statutes it is stated that
the Brothers form a society for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
gratuitously affording to children a
Christian education; that this society
is ruled by a superior-general,
aided by a certain number of assistants;
that the superior is elected
for life by the General Chapter or
by a special commission; and that
the superior nominates the directors,
and also the visitors, whose
duty it is to watch over the regularity
of the masters and the efficient
management of the schools.</p>

<p>The Brothers had a powerful
friend in M. Emery, the Superior
of S. Sulpice, a man of high character
and sound judgment, and
who was held in great esteem by
the emperor, as well as by every
one with whom he had anything to
do. Napoleon, particularly, appreciating
the excellent organization
of the society, recommended “the
Brothers of De la Salle in preference
to any other teachers.”</p>

<p>We now come to the special subject
of our memoir.</p>

<p>Among the dispersed members
of the institute who first responded
to the invitation of Cardinal Fesch
were two brothers of the name of
Galet, whose memory is especially
connected with Brother Philip.
On the suppression of the house at
Marseilles they sought shelter from
the violence of the Revolution in
the retired hamlet of Châteaurange
(Haute Loire), where they kept a
school. On receiving the cardinal’s
circular the elder brother announced
to the pupils that he had
been a Brother of the Christian
Schools, until compelled to return
to secular life by the suppression
of his institute; but learning that
this was re-established, he was
about to depart at once to Lyons,
there to resume his place in it,
adding that, if any of them should
desire to enter there, he would do
all in his power to obtain their admission
and to help them to become
accustomed to the change of
life.</p>

<p>Amongst those who availed themselves
of this invitation, and who,
three years later (in 1811), presented
himself to be received into the novitiate,
was Mathieu Bransiet, born
on the 1st of November, 1792, at
the hamlet of Gachat, in the Commune
of Apinac (Loire). Pierre
Bransiet, his father, was a mason;
the house in which he lived, with a
portion of land around it, which
he cultivated, constituting all his
worldly possessions. Like his wife
(whose maiden name was Marie-Anne
Varagnat), he was a faithful
Christian, and during the revolutionary
persecution habitually afforded
refuge to the proscribed
priests. It was the custom of the
little family to assemble at a very
early hour of the morning in a corner
of the barn, where, on a poor
table behind a wall or barricade of
hay and straw, the Holy Sacrifice
was offered up, as in the past ages
of paganism, and as under Protestant
rule, whether in the British Isles
not so many generations ago, or in
Switzerland at the very time at
which we write; some trusty person
meanwhile keeping watch without,
in readiness to give timely
warning in case of need. Nor did
Pierre Bransiet confine himself to
the exercise of this perilous but
blessed hospitality; many a time
did he accompany the priests by
night in their visits to the sick and
dying, and bearing with them the
sacred Viaticum after the hidden
manner of the proscribed.</p>

<p>Amid scenes and impressions
such as these the young Bransiet
passed his childhood, learning the
mysteries of the faith from an
“abolished” catechism; kneeling
before the crucifix, which was hated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
and trampled under foot in those
godless days; and worshipping
when those who prayed must hide
themselves to pray. Thus a deeply
serious tone became, as it were, the
keynote of his soul, which harmonized
with all that was earnest and
austere. Even as an old man he
never spoke without deep feeling
of his early years, when he only
knew religion as a poor exile and
outcast on the earth. The simple
and hardy habits of his cottage-home,
his own early training in
labor, self-denial, and respectful
obedience, the Christian teaching
of his mother and elder sister (now
a religious at Puy), all helped to
form his character and mould his
future life. He was the most diligent
of the young scholars of Châteaurange,
which is half a league
distant from Gachat, and made his
first communion in the church of
Apinac, when the Church of France
had issued from her catacombs, and
the Catholic worship was again allowed.
As a child Mathieu was
remarkable for his never-failing
kindness and affectionateness towards
his brothers and sisters, for
the tenderness of his conscience,
and for his jealousy for the honor
of God, which would cause him to
burst into tears if he saw any one
do what he knew would offend him.</p>

<p>Mathieu was seventeen years of
age when, with the full consent of
his parents, he entered the novitiate
at Lyons. He had six brothers,
one of whom followed his example,
and is at the present time
worthily fulfilling the office of visitor
to the Christian Schools of
Clermont-Ferrand. Boniface was
the name by which the young novice
was at first called; but as this
was soon afterwards exchanged for
that of Philip, we shall always so
designate him.</p>

<p>His exemplary assiduity and
piety, as well as his rare qualifications
as a teacher, quickly drew attention
to him, and on account of
his skill in mathematics he was appointed
professor in a school of
coast navigation at Auray in the
Morbihan, where he was very successful.
While here he wrote a
treatise on the subject of his instructions,
which was his first attempt
in the special kind of writing
in which he afterwards so greatly
excelled. M. Deshayes, the curé
of Auray, and a man of great discernment,
was so much struck by
his practical wisdom and good
sense that he said to the Brother
director, “See if Brother Boniface
is not one day the superior of your
congregation!”</p>

<p>It was at Auray, in 1812, that
he made his first vows, and there
he remained until 1816. Of the
boys who during this time were
under his care, no less than forty
afterwards entered the sacerdotal
or the monastic life. From Auray
he was sent to Rethel as director, and
from thence, in 1818, to fill the same
office at Rheims, the nursery of his
order, and afterwards at Metz. In
1823 the superior-general, Brother
William of Jesus&mdash;who was seventy-five
years old, and had been in the
congregation from the time he was
fifteen&mdash;appointed him to the responsible
post of director of S.
Nicolas des Champs at Paris, as well
as visitor of several other houses
in the provinces and in the capital.
In 1826 he published a book
entitled <cite>Practical Geometry applied
to Linear Design</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> which is regarded
by competent judges as the best
work of the kind in France. He
continued director at Paris during
the eight remaining years of Brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
William’s life, which ended a
little before the Revolution of July,
1830. On the succession of Brother
Anaclete as superior-general
Brother Philip was elected one of
the four assistants of the General
Chapter, and thus found himself associated
with the general government
of the congregation; but the higher
he was raised in the responsible
offices of his order, the more apparent
became his good sense and
sound understanding&mdash;qualifications
of especial value amid the
troubles of that stormy time.</p>

<p>The opening of evening classes
for working-men is due to Brother
Philip, who first commenced them
in Paris, at S. Nicolas des Champs,
and at Gros Caillou, extending
them, with marked encouragement
from the Minister of Public Instruction,
M. Guizot, to other quarters
of the city. The law of 1833,
by establishing normal schools for
primary instruction, furnished a
test as well as a rivalry to the
schools of the Brothers; but the
latter showed themselves equal to
the emergency, supplementing their
course of instruction by additional
subjects, and taking all necessary
measures for carrying on their work
in the most efficient manner.</p>

<p>Their novitiates were the models
of the normal primary schools; but
in comparing the vast difference of
expense between the one and the
other it is easy to perceive on which
side self-denial and prudent administration
are to be found. A
normal school like the one at Versailles
costs more than 60,000 francs,
or 12,000 dollars, yearly; and that
of Paris more than 100,000 francs,
or 20,000 dollars; while the Brothers,
for the training of their masters,
receive nothing from the state;
and these young masters, formed
with the aid of small resources, become
none the less admirable teachers,
having moreover in their favor
the double grace of devotedness
and a special vocation.</p>

<p>Under the name of Louis Constantin,
Brother Anaclete began the
publication of works of instruction
which was afterwards so efficiently
continued by Brother Philip. The
latter gave particular attention to
the formation of a preparatory novitiate
called <i lang="fr">le petit noviciat</i>, which
is not a novitiate, properly so called,
but a preliminary trial of vocations,
similar to that of the <i lang="fr">Petit
Séminaire</i>. Should the young members
persevere, their education prepares
them for teaching; and if
their vocation is found to be elsewhere,
this time of study will, all
the same, be of great advantage to
them, whatever may be their future.</p>

<p>The little novices were particular
favorites of Brother Philip, who took
delight not only in instructing them
himself in both sacred and secular
knowledge, but watched over them
with a sort of maternal affection,
and was often seen carrying into
their cells warm socks or any other
article of apparel of which he had
discovered the need.</p>

<p>On the death of Brother Anaclete,
in 1838, Brother Philip was unanimously
elected superior by the
General Chapter, on the 21st of
November. After the election the
chapter, contrary to its wont, abstained
from passing any decree,
“leaving to the enlightened zeal
of the much-honored superior the
care of maintaining in the Brothers
the spirit of fervor.”</p>

<p>The Abbé de la Salle had recommended
the practice of mortification,
silence, recollection, contempt
for earthly things and for the
praise of man, humility, and prayer;
and the venerable founder has
continued to speak in the persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
of the successive superiors of his
institute. We have not space here
to give quotations from the circulars
issued by Brother Philip during
the thirty-five years of his government,
but they must be read before
a just appreciation can be had of
all that a “Christian Brother” is
required to be, and also of the heart
and mind of the writer, who never
spoke of himself, but whose daily
life and example were his best eloquence.
He always presided over
the annual retreats, commencing
by that of the community in Paris.
One of the Brothers, in speaking of
these, said: “In listening to him
I always felt that we had a saint
for our father.”</p>

<p>A rule had been made by the
chapter of 1787 that the Brother
assistants should cause the portrait
of the superior-general to be taken
with the year of his election. It
was with the greatest reluctance,
and only from a spirit of obedience,
as well as on account of the insistence
of the Brother assistants, that
Brother Philip suffered this rule to
be observed in his case. Horace
Vernet had the highest esteem for
the superior-general, and told the
Brothers who went to request him
to take the portrait that he would
willingly give them the benefit of
his art in return for the benefit of
their prayers. Brother Philip sat
to him for an hour, and the painting
so much admired in the Exhibition
of 1845 was the result. Later
on the visits of Brother Philip
were a much-valued source of help
and consolation to the great painter
during his last illness.</p>

<p>Our sketch would be incomplete
were we to leave unnoticed the
daily life of the Brothers of the
Christian Schools, which exhibits
their profession put into practice.</p>

<p>The Brothers rise at half-past
four; read the <cite>Imitation</cite> until a
quarter to five, followed by prayer
and meditation until Mass, at six,
after which they attend to official
work until breakfast, at a quarter-past
seven; at half-past seven the
rosary is said, and the classes commence
at eight; catechism at eleven,
examination at half-past; at a quarter
to twelve dinner, after which is
a short recreation. At one o’clock
prayers and rosary; classes recommence
at half-past one. Official
work at five; at half-past five preparation
of the catechism; spiritual
reading at six; at half-past six
meditation; at seven supper and
recreation; at half-past eight evening
prayers; at nine the Brothers
retire to bed; and at a quarter-past
nine the lights are extinguished,
and there is perfect silence.</p>

<p>After having been for twenty-five
years established in the Rue du
Faubourg St. Martin the Brothers
had to make way for the building
of the Station of the Eastern Railway
(Gare de l’Est), and after
long search found a suitable house
in the Rue Plumet, now Rue Oudinot,
which they purchased, and of
which they took possession, as the
mother-house of the institute, in
the early part of 1847.</p>

<p>On entering this house it is at
once evident that rule and order
preside there. All the employments,
even to the post of <i lang="fr">concièrge</i>,
or door-keeper, are carried on by
the Brothers, each one of whom is
engaged in his appointed duty. The
first court, called the <i lang="fr">Procure</i>, presents
a certain amount of movement
and activity from its relations
with the world outside. The second
court, which is the place for
recreations, and which leads into
the interior, is much more spacious
and planted with trees. It was in
these alleys that Brother Philip was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
accustomed to walk during his few
moments of repose, conversing with
one of the Brothers or readily listening
to any of the youngest little
novices who might address him.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr">Salle du Régime</i>, or Chamber
of Government, is a marvel in the
perfection of its arrangements. The
superior-general is there at his
post, the assistants also; the place
of each occupying but a small space
and on the same line. Each has his
straw-seated chair, his bureau, and
papers; the chair of the superior
differing in no way from the rest.
On each bureau is a small case,
marked with its ticket, indicating
the countries placed under the particular
direction of the Brother assistant
to whom it belongs. There
are to be found all the countries to
which the schools of the institute
have been extended, from the cities
of France and of Europe to the
most distant regions of the habitable
globe. Little cards in little
drawers represent the immensity
of the work. Everything is ruled,
marked, classified, in such a manner
as to take up the smallest
amount of space possible; as if in
all things these servants of God endeavored
to occupy no more room
in this world than was absolutely
necessary. “We have seen,” writes
M. Poujoulat, “in the <i lang="fr">Salle du Régime</i>,
the place which had been occupied
by Brother Philip; his straw-seated
chair and simple bureau,
upon which stood a small image of
the Blessed Virgin, for which he
had a particular affection, and one
of S. Peter, given to him at Rome.
From this unpretending throne he
governed all the houses of his order
in France, Belgium, Italy, Asia, and
the New World, and hither letters
daily reached him from all countries.
He wrote much; and his
letters had the brevity and precision
of one accustomed to command.
The secretariate occupies ten Brothers,
and, notwithstanding its variety
and extent, nothing is complicated
or irregular in this well-ordered
administration.</p>

<p>“We visited, as we should visit a
sanctuary, the cell of Brother Philip,
and there saw his hard bed
and deal bedstead, over which hung
his crucifix.… A few small prints
on the walls were the only luxury
he allowed himself.… Some
class-books ranged on shelves, a
chair, a bureau, and a cupboard
(the latter still containing the few
articles of apparel which he had
worn), … compose the whole
of the furniture. How often the
hours which he so needed (physically)
to have passed in sleep had
Brother Philip spent at this desk or
kneeling before his crucifix, laying
his cares and responsibilities before
God, to whom, in this same little
chamber, when the long day’s toil
was ended, he offered up his soul!”</p>

<p>In another room, that of the venerable
Brother Calixtus, may be
seen the documents relating to the
beatification of the Abbé de la
Salle, bearing a seal impressed with
the device of the congregation&mdash;<i lang="la">Signum
Fidei</i>. Besides thirty-five autograph
letters of the founder and
the form of profession of the members,
there are here the bulls of approbation
accorded by Pope Benedict
XIII. in 1725, and the letters-patent
granted the previous year by
Louis XV. In a room called the
Chamber of Relics are preserved
various sacred vestments and other
objects which had belonged to the
venerable De la Salle. The chapel
is at present a temporary construction.</p>

<p>The mother-house comprises the
two novitiates and a normal school
appropriated solely to the perfecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
of the younger masters. It is
from the little novices that the Brothers
select the children of the
choir. To see these twenty-five or
thirty little fellows on great festivals,
in alb and red cassock, swinging
censers or scattering flowers
before the Blessed Sacrament, amid
the rich harmonies of the organ
and the church’s sacred chant, was
Brother Philip’s especial delight;
he seemed to see in them, as it
were, a little battalion of angels offering
their innocent homage to the
hidden God.</p>

<p>If order forms one part of the
permanent spirit of the institute,
so also does the practice of poverty;
but it is <em>holy</em> poverty, tranquil
and cheerful. Self-denial is the
foundation of all that is seen there,
but so also are propriety and suitability.
The life of the Brothers is
austere, but by no means gloomy;
on the contrary, one of their prevailing
characteristics is a cheerful
equanimity, which seems never to
forsake them. Nothing useless is
permitted in any of the houses.
“We must not,” wrote Brother
Agathon in 1787, “allow anything
which may habitually or without
good reason turn aside the Brothers
from the exercises of the community
or trouble their tranquillity;
such things, for instance, as fancy
dogs, birds, the culture of flowers,
shrubs, or curious plants.” And
these regulations have been faithfully
observed.</p>

<p>This the mother-house, in the
Rue Oudinot, is the centre of
government to the numerous establishments
of the institute spread
over the earth; it is, in fact, their
little capital, from whence the
superior-general and his assistants,
like the monarch and parliament of
a constitutional kingdom, exercise
a wise and beneficent dominion.</p>

<p>The Revolution of February,
1848, notwithstanding the general
disorganization of which it was the
cause, did not prejudicially affect
the work of the Brothers of the
Christian Schools. The moderate
spirit of a large majority of the
constituency was in their favor, and
the triumph of what was styled the
“right of association” was of benefit
to the religious orders. And,
besides this, men high in office acknowledged
the small consideration
given to the religious element in the
primary instruction organized by
the law to have occasioned the
moral devastation of which they
had been the sorrowful witnesses.</p>

<p>This state of opinion, by producing
an increased respect for the
Brothers and appreciation of their
work, was very favorable to the
institute of De la Salle. In 1849
the superior-general was requested
to take part in an extra-parliamentary
commission on the subject of
public instruction and liberty of
teaching. His extensive and practical
knowledge made a great impression
on his fellow-commissioners.
Naturally modest and retiring,
he was never one of the most
forward to speak, but the most
listened to of any; his observations
being so conclusive and to the
point as invariably to decide the
ultimate resolution of a question;
and answers which others were
painfully seeking he found at once
in the store-house of his long experience.
That portion of the law
of March 15, 1850, relating to
primary instruction, bears the impress
of these discussions.</p>

<p>The epoch of the Second Empire
was a time of difficulty for the Brothers.
The new government, which
had begun by wishing to decorate
Brother Philip&mdash;who was always
rebellious against seductions of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
nature&mdash;raised against his institute
the question of scholar remuneration,
alleging that it owed its success
merely to its rule of teaching
gratuitously, to the prejudice of the
schools of the state, and requiring
the municipality of every place
where the Brothers were established
to insist on their adoption of
the remunerative system. These
difficulties, which had begun under
the ministry of M. Fortoul, became
more serious under that of M. Rouland.</p>

<p>Now, it was one of the fundamental
rules of the institute that
the Brothers should receive no remuneration
whatever in return for
their instructions. Brother Philip,
therefore, in the name of the statutes
of his order, resolutely resisted
their infringement. To punish
him for so doing the annual sum
of eight thousand four hundred
francs, which had been granted to
the institute under the ministry of
M. Guizot for the general expenses
of administration, was suppressed,
many of the houses were closed,
and forty more threatened with the
same fate.</p>

<p>At last, after an anxious struggle
of seven years’ duration, it was decided
by the General Chapter, assembled
in 1861, that, to avoid worse
evils and save the institute from
destruction, a partial concession
should be made. Payments were
allowed where the government insisted,
but it was expressly stipulated
that these payments would be
the property of the municipal council,
the Brothers themselves having
nothing whatever to do with them.</p>

<p>This concession, which had only
been forced from him by a hard
necessity, was a great vexation to
Brother Philip, who, however, consoled
himself with the thought that
this moral oppression would only
be of temporary duration. Nor
was he mistaken. For twenty years
past not only has the gratuitous
system not been attacked, but the
very men who opposed it in the
case of the Brothers have themselves
insisted on its general adoption,
in their endeavors to force
upon the whole of France a primary
instruction without religion.</p>

<p>The ministry of M. Rouland,
being particularly jealous of Brother
Philip as head of a religious
congregation, had other trials in
store for him, taking out of his
hands the right of appointing masters,
in order that it might, through
the prefects, place lay teachers of
its own selection in places where
the people themselves had requested
that their children should be
taught by the Brothers of the Christian
Schools. The measures taken
to attain this end were, however,
only partially successful.</p>

<p>In 1862 a curious complaint was
made against those who had for so
long been called <i lang="fr">Ignorantins</i>, accusing
them of teaching too many
things and overstepping the limits
allowed by Article 23 of the law of
1850.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>When at Dijon, in 1862, Brother
Pol-de-Léon made his request to be
instituted as director of the <i lang="fr">pensionnat</i>,
the administration refused to
grant it, on the ground that the
title of “elementary school” taken
by the said <i lang="fr">pensionnat</i> was in manifest
contradiction to the advanced
instruction given there, and which
included algebra, geometry, trigonometry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
French literature, cosmography,
physics, chemistry, mechanics,
English, and German. The Brothers,
thus accused of distributing
too much learning, replied that, if
the law of 1850 did not mention
these subjects of instruction, neither
did it prohibit them; they consented,
however, to withdraw a portion
from this programme. The president
of the provincial council, M.
Leffemberg, was merciful, and allowed
some of the additions, among
which were English and German,
to remain.</p>

<p>Subsequent arrangements have
been made, by which a regular
course of secondary or higher instruction
has been organized by the
Brothers. This is admirably carried
on in their immense establishment
at Passy (amongst other places), and
its normal school is at Cluny; and
no one now disputes with the institute
the honor of having been the
originator of the special course of
secondary instruction which has
been found to answer so remarkably
in France.</p>

<p>One of the most serious anxieties
of Brother Philip under the Second
Empire arose in 1866 on the subject
of dispensation from military
service. Since their reorganization
the Brothers of the Christian
Schools had been exempted from
serving in the army, on account of
their being already engaged in
another form of service for the public
benefit, and on condition of
their binding themselves for a period
of not less than ten years to the
public instruction. A circular of
M. Duruy, by changing the terms
of the law, deprived the Brothers of
their exemption, whilst in that very
same month of February M. le
Maréchal Randon, in addressing
general instructions to the marshals
of military divisions in the provinces,
gave distinct orders that the
Brothers of the Christian Schools
should not be required to serve, on
account of the occupation in which
they were already engaged; thus,
in two contradictory circulars on
the same question, the interpretation
of the Minister of Public Instruction
was unfavorable to the
education of the people; the contrary
being the case with that of the
Minister of War.</p>

<p>We have not space to give the
particulars of the long struggle that
was carried on upon this question,
and in which Cardinals Matthieu
and Bonnechose energetically took
part with the Brothers; the Archbishop
of Rennes and the Bishop
of Ajaccio also petitioning the senate
on their behalf. But in vain.
To the great anguish of Brother
Philip, the senate voted according
to the good pleasure of M. Duruy.
The superior-general left no means
untried to avert the threatened
conscription of the young Brothers;
he petitioned, he wrote, he pleaded,
with an energy and perseverance
that nothing could daunt, until the
law, passed on the 1st of February,
1868, relieved him from this pressing
anxiety. He had unconsciously
won for himself so high an opinion
in the country that his authority
fought, as it were, for his widespread
family.</p>

<p>Ever since the Revolution of
1848 a great clamor has been raised
in France about the moral elevation
of the laboring classes; but
while the innovators who believe
only in themselves have been talking,
the Christian Brothers have
been working. We have already
mentioned the classes for adults
established by the predecessor of
Brother Philip. These, and especially
the evening classes, were made
by the latter the objects of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
especial attention. He arranged
that linear drawing should in these
occupy a considerable place; thus
there is scarcely a place of any importance
in France in which courses
of lessons in drawing do not
form a part of the popular instruction,
and, with the exception of a
few large towns which already possessed
a school of design, nearly all
the working population of the country
has, up to the present time,
gained its knowledge of the art in
the classes directed by the Brothers.
Proof of this fact is yearly afforded
in the “Exhibition of the Fine Arts
applied to Practical Industries,”
which, since 1860, has been annually
opened at Paris, and in which
the productions of their schools are
remarkable among the rest for their
excellence, as well as their number.
The gold medal as well as the high
praise awarded them by the jury of
the International Exhibition in 1867
testified to the thoroughness of the
manner in which the pupils of the
Christian Brothers are taught.</p>

<p>One of the gods worshipped by
the XIXth century is “utility,” and
to such an extent by some of its
votaries that one of them, some
years ago, proposed to the Pacha
of Egypt to demolish the pyramids,
on the ground that they were “useless.”
This reproach cannot certainly
be applied to the Brothers of
the Christian Schools. All their
arrangements, their instructions,
their daily life, have the stamp of
utility, and that of the highest social
order.</p>

<p>Although our space does not permit
us to speak of the works of
the Brothers in detail, their variety
answering, as it does, to all the needs
of the people, yet a few words must
be given to that of S. Nicolas, for
the education of young boys of the
working-classes.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the Restoration,
in 1827, M. de Bervanger, a
priest, collected seven poor orphan
children, whom he placed under
the care of an honest workman in
the Rue des Anglaises (Faubourg St.
Marceau), who employed them in
his workshop, his wife assisting him
in taking charge of them. This
was the commencement of the work
of S. Nicolas. In a few months the
little lodging was too small for its
increasing number of inmates, and,
assistance having been sent, a house
was taken in the Rue de Vaugirard,
where the boys were taught various
trades and manufactures, but still
under a certain amount of difficulty,
a sum of seven or eight thousand
francs being pressingly required.
It was at this time that M. de Bervanger
became acquainted with
Count Victor de Noailles, who at
once supplied the sum, and from that
time took a great and increasing interest
in the establishment, of which
he afterwards became the head.
On the breaking out of the revolution
of 1830 he saved it by establishing
himself there under the title
of director; M. de Bervanger, for
the sake of prudence, having only
that of almoner. The two friends,
being together at Rome in the winter
of 1834-5, were warmly encouraged
in their undertaking by Pope
Benedict XIII., who desired Count
Victor to remain at its head. Soon
afterwards a purchase of the house
was effected, and in this house of
S. Nicolas the count died in the following
year. From that time M.
de Bervanger took the sole direction,
and the work prospered in
spite of every opposition. To meet
its increased requirements he bought
the Château of Issy, and Mgr. Affre,
Archbishop of Paris, announced
himself the protector of what he declared
to be “the most excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
work in his diocese.” The republic
of 1848 was rather profitable to it
than otherwise. Former pupils of
the house, enrolled in the Garde
Mobile, did their duty so bravely in
quelling the terrible insurrection of
June that to fifteen of their number
the Cross of Honor was awarded,
proving that in those days of
violence the <i lang="fr">gamin de Paris</i>, the
foundation or material of the work
of S. Nicolas, could be a hero.</p>

<p>This work, owing to the unbounded
energy and devotion of its
reverend director, had immensely
increased in efficiency and extent.
More than eleven hundred children
were here receiving the elementary
instruction, religious and professional,
of which no other model existed.
But although his courage
never failed, his strength declined,
and, to save the work, he gave it
up, in 1858, into the hands of the
Archbishop of Paris, Cardinal Morlot.
A document exists which
proves it to have been necessary to
resist the will of the holy priest, in
order that, after having given up
the value of about a million and a
half of francs, without asking either
board or lodging, he should not be
left utterly without resources. The
archbishop, after treating with the
members of the council of administration
and obtaining the consent
of Brother Philip, who threw himself
heartily into the work, placed
S. Nicolas in the hands of the Brothers
of the Christian Schools, who
for the last fifteen years have admirably
fulfilled this additional responsibility
then confided to them.
At the time of their installation the
Brothers appointed to S. Nicolas
were seventy in number; they have
now increased to a hundred and
thirty, for the direction of the three
houses, one of which is at Paris,
another at Issy, and the third at
Igny. The house in the Rue Vaugirard
alone contains about a thousand
boys, who are there taught
various trades; there are carpenters,
cabinet-makers, carvers, opticians,
watchmakers, designers of
patterns for different manufactures,
etc., etc. At the end of their apprenticeship
these lads can earn
six, seven, or even eight francs a
day. The most skilful enter the
schools of <i lang="fr">Arts et Métiers</i>&mdash;arts and
trades&mdash;the most brilliant efforts
being rewarded by the rank of civil
engineer.</p>

<p>The large and fertile garden of
Issy is a school of horticulture, and
at Igny the boys are taught field-labor
and farming, as well as gardening;
the fruits and vegetables
of Igny forming a valuable resource
for the house in the Rue
Vaugirard, at Paris. The Sisters of
the Christian Schools have charge
of the laundry and needle-work of
the three establishments. Once every
month two members of the council
inspect these schools to the minutest
details&mdash;the classes, the workshops,
the gardens, the house arrangements,
the neatness of the
books, etc.&mdash;and interrogate the
children.</p>

<p>Instrumental as well as vocal music
is taught at S. Nicolas as a
professional art. A few years ago
might be seen on the road from
Issy to Paris two battalions of
youths who passed each other on
the way, the one that of the “little
ones,” clad in blouses of black woollen;
the other the pupils and apprentices
of the Rue Vaugirard, in dark
gray, each with its band of music.
The passers-by called them “the
regiments of S. Nicolas.” In the
French expedition into China the
band of the flag-ship was chiefly
composed of former pupils of these
establishments, who, faithful to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
old traditions, had with them the
banner of their patron saint, which
was duly displayed on grand occasions,
to the great satisfaction of
the admiral commanding the expedition.</p>

<p>The idea of the celebrated Dr.
Branchet, of placing blind and also
deaf and dumb children in the primary
schools of the Brothers, has
been attended with the happiest
results. These children enter at
the same age as those who can
speak and see, and, like them, remain
until they have made their
first Communion, and leave just at
the period when they can be received
into special institutions,
where they are kept for eight years
longer. The rapid improvement in
these poor children, who are under
the care of the Brothers, and of the
Sisters of S. Vincent de Paul and of
S. Marie, is truly wonderful. Mistrust,
timidity, and reserve speedily
give place to cheerfulness, confidence,
and affection; the habitual
contact with children who can see
and hear being a great assistance
to the development of their intelligence
and capabilities.</p>

<p>In 1841 the Minister of the Interior,
acting by desire of the local
authorities, requested that the Brothers
should be sent to certain of
the great central prisons of France.
The first essay was made at Nîmes,
where three Brothers were placed
over that portion of the prison appropriated
to the younger offenders,
in whom so great a change for the
better soon became apparent that
a general desire arose that all the
prisoners, twelve hundred in number,
should be put under their
charge. Brother Philip, after taking
the matter into careful consideration,
gave his consent, to the
great joy of the prefect of Nîmes;
and in the same year, 1841, the
rough keepers were replaced by a
detachment of thirty-seven Brothers
of the Christian Schools. In the
course of two months the new organization
had effected a complete
change in the prison, not only as
regarded the docility and general
improvement of the prisoners, but
their health also, from the alterations
made by the new managers in
the sanitary arrangements of the
building. Brother Facile, a man
of great intelligence, firmness, and
good sense, was the director of the
Brothers, who had various trials to
undergo in the exercise of their
present functions. In spite of various
difficulties, most of which
were occasioned by the conduct of
lay officials, the Brothers remained
at Nîmes until 1848, when the revolution
cut short their work, not
only there, but also at Fontevrault
(where they had the charge of fourteen
hundred prisoners), at Aniane,
and at Mélun.</p>

<p>The institute of the Brothers of
the Christian Schools, being of
French origin, naturally developed
itself first in France. At the beginning
of 1874 it numbered nine
hundred and forty-five establishments
in that country, more than
eight thousand Brothers, and above
three hundred and twelve thousand
pupils. From the commencement
of the congregation it has had a
house at Rome; and at Turin their
schools are attended by more than
three thousand five hundred children.
They easily took root in
Catholic Belgium, where their pupils
are above fifteen thousand in
number. They are in England, Austria,
Prussia, and Switzerland. Passing
out of Europe, we find them
honored and encouraged in the little
republic of Ecuador, where they
were first planted in 1863, under
Brother Albanus, a man of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
prudence as well as of activity and
zeal. Two years later four Brothers
embarked for Cochin-China,
the Admiral of La Grandière having
requested Brother Philip to
send them to teach the children
of the new French colony. Their
first house there was at Saïgon, to
which others were added in different
parts of the country, as more
Brothers arrived. They have establishments
in Madagascar, the
Seychelles, the East Indies, and
the Isle of Mauritius, and have
been in the Ile de la Réunion ever
since 1816. They are at Tunis,
where they teach the children in
Italian (that language being the
one most usually spoken there); and
in Algiers, where for years the bishop,
Mgr. Dupuch, had been begging
that they might be sent. Brother
Philip was both ready and
willing, but the delays and difficulties
raised by the French Minister
of War, would not allow him to accede
to the request until 1852, after
the death of M. Dupuch, who had
begun the negotiation ten years
before. When, in 1870, contrary
to the entreaties of the bishop, Mgr.
de Lavigerie, and the protest of
the inhabitants of the place, the
Brothers were forced out of their
schools&mdash;their only offence being
that they were Christian&mdash;they opened
free schools, independent of any
government arrangement, and had
them filled at once by three thousand
of their former pupils; the
same thing being done at other
towns with the same result. A
change for the better took place in
the ideas of the home government
in 1871, and at the present time,
thanks to the rule of Marshal MacMahon,
the Christian Schools of
Algiers have been restored to their
rights.</p>

<p>In concert with the Lazarists
the Brothers opened schools at
Smyrna in 1841, and soon afterwards
at Constantinople, with the
authorization of the government.
They are settled also at Alexandria
under the protection of the bishop,
and under that of the vicar-apostolic
at Cairo, where they have received
marked proofs of interest
from the Viceroy of Egypt.</p>

<p>But it is not of the children of
the Old World only that the Brothers
have so largely taken possession;
the spirit of Christianity is a
spirit of conquest, and the missionary,
the Sister of Charity, and the
Christian Brother are of the conquering
race.</p>

<p>The infant foundations of the latter
have a particular interest in the
vast American continent, where
either all is comparatively of yesterday,
or else the vast solitudes
of ages still await the footstep of
civilization, or even of man. Religious
orders prosper in this land;
and the children of La Salle first
settled in Canada in 1837, at the
earnest invitation of M. Quiblier,
Superior of the Seminary of S. Sulpice
at Montreal, and of Mgr. Lartique,
the bishop of that city. Four
Brothers of the Christian Schools
were sent by the packet-boat <cite>Louis
Philippe</cite>, which sailed on the 10th
of October in that year, reaching
New York on the 13th of November.
The <i lang="fr">curés</i> of S. Sulpice at
Paris were the earliest supporters
of the venerable De la Salle; and
it is interesting to notice, at a distance
of two centuries and on the
other side of the Atlantic, the sons
of the same house faithful to the
same traditions. The work spread
rapidly in Montreal, where in a
short time twenty-five Brothers were
occupied in teaching eighteen hundred
children. Four of their pupils
of this city, who had become postulants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
took the habit on All Saints’
Day, 1840. The same year brought
them a visit from the Governor-General
of Canada, Lord Sydenham,
who, after entering with interest into
the details of their work, gave them
the greatest encouragement. In
the course of the following year
they held their classes in presence
of the bishops of Montreal, Quebec,
Kingston, and Boston, numerously
accompanied by their clergy, and
received the congratulations and
benediction of the prelates. They
opened a school at Quebec in 1843,
and later, on the invitation of the
Archbishop of Baltimore, Brother
Aidant went to found one also in
that city. It was he who was authorized
by Brother Philip, in 1847,
to go to Paris in order to give an
account of the work which had been
carried on in America during the
previous ten years, and who returned
thither, accompanied by five
more Brothers.</p>

<p>When, in 1848, the members of
the institute were withdrawn from
the central prisons of France, their
superior felt that the energetic Brother
Facile would be an invaluable
superintendent of the Christian
Schools in the New World. Brother
Aidant had done great things
during the eleven years that he had
occupied the post of director and
visitor of the province of Canada
and of the United States. Five
principal houses, employing fifty
Brothers, had been established
there&mdash;namely, those of Montreal,
Quebec, Three Rivers, Baltimore,
and New York; but the work received
a new and extensive development
during the twelve years
of the directorship of Brother Facile,
who, when summoned to
France by Brother Philip in 1861,
left behind him 78 schools, 24,532
pupils, 368 Brothers, and 74 novices;
and this wonderful increase
has subsequently continued.</p>

<p>In 1863 Brother Philip considered
it advisable to divide North
America into two provinces, namely,
those of Canada and the United
States; Brother Ambrose, director
of the schools of St. Louis, Missouri,
being named visitor of the province
of the United States, in residence
at New York; and Brother
Liguori, of Moulins, in residence
at Montreal, visitor of the province
of Canada.</p>

<p>The Brothers of the Christian
Schools in America are recruited
not only from France, but from
all the nationalities of the country.
Among them are Franco-Canadians,
Anglo-Americans, Irish, Belgians,
and Germans. The visit of Lord
Young, the Governor-General of
Canada, in 1869, to their principal
school in Montreal, was a sort of
official recognition of their teaching
on the part of Great Britain. He
praised their work as being the
“type and model of a good education.”
Amongst those who were
presented to him, the governor-general
saw with particular interest
Brother Adelbertus, the only surviving
one of the four who were
sent to Canada in 1837. They now
have schools in all the six provinces
of Canada, and since 1869 have
been established also at Charlottetown,
the capital of Prince Edward’s
Island. A Protestant writer
who visited their schools at Halifax,
in giving an account of what
he had seen, stated that he was
greatly struck by “the perfect discipline
of the pupils, their silence,
their prompt obedience and great
assiduity, their neatness, and the
good expression of their countenances,
whether Catholic or Protestant.”
He did not take offence
at the short prayer said at the striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
of every hour. “Each child,”
he observes, “can repeat to himself
the prayer learnt at his mother’s
knee.” But what most of all
excited his wonder were the difficult
exercises in geometry, trigonometry,
land-surveying, algebra (and
other sciences, of which he gives a
list), which he saw accomplished
by the class of advanced pupils
under the direction of Brother
Christian. According to his account,
the so-called <i lang="fr">Ignorantins</i> are
almost alarmingly scientific.</p>

<p>When we bear in mind that Canada,
although its present population
does not amount to four millions, is
one-third larger than France, and
that its natural resources are equivalent
to those of France and Germany
combined, we can understand
the importance of its future when
once those resources shall be made
available; and also we perceive the
wisdom of the Christian Brothers in
doing their utmost to prepare the
way for this result to be attained
by a well and religiously instructed
generation.</p>

<p>But to return to Europe. The
work of the Christian Schools began
in Ireland, in 1802, when Mr. Edmund
Rice, of Waterford, founded
one in his native town, with great
success. Another was established
in 1807, by Mr. Thomas O’Brien,
at Carrick-on-Suir, and a third at
Dungarvan; but it was not until
1822 that the Irish Brothers adopted
the rule of the venerable De la
Salle. The institute in Ireland is
the same in spirit as it is the same
in rule, with some slight modifications;
but it does not depend upon
the French institute, although connected
with it in friendly and fraternal
relations, its separate existence
being especially adapted
to the wants of the people of Ireland.</p>

<p>In tracing some of the widespread
ramifications of his work
we seem to have lost sight of the
toiling Brother to whom so much
of its success was due. The fact
of having the responsibility of so
extensive an administration did
not prevent his personally working
at the classes like any other Brother
of the institute. He possessed
in a remarkable degree the gift
of imparting knowledge, whether in
things human or divine. From the
time of his entrance into the institute
his manner of teaching the
catechism had been remarked; and
it was always with the liveliest enjoyment
that he fulfilled this important
portion of his duties. Nothing
of all this teaching has been
written down; but there remains a
book written by Brother Philip, of
which the title is <cite>Explanations in a
catechetical form of the Epistles and
Gospels for all the Sundays and
principal festivals of the year</cite>, in
which the varied depths of religious
thought of the pious writer
are presented with a precision and
yet readiness of expression in themselves
constituting a simple and
earnest eloquence. This book is
considered a model, both with regard
to the substance and the art
of teaching; the writer does not
fit the truth to his words, but his
words to the truth.</p>

<p>Thus far we have sketched the
origin and progress of the institute
of the Brothers of the Christian
Schools in times of comparative
peace, with brief exceptions; in
the second and concluding part of
our notice the members of this
institute will appear under a new
aspect&mdash;on the battle-fields where
these men of prayer and peace
showed themselves to be, in that
which constitutes true heroism, the
bravest of the brave.</p>

<h3>THE LADY ANNE OF CLEVES.</h3>

<p>Anne of Cleves, the fourth queen
and third wife of Henry VIII. of
England, is one of the least known
personages in history. Fortunately
for herself, she never gained the
sad celebrity of his victims, Catherine
of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, and
Catherine Howard. As virtuous and
sedate as the former, she was less
high-spirited and dangerously fearless.
At the same time, her gentleness
was much the same as that
of her only royal predecessor, and,
like her, she won the respect and
love of the people. If she submitted
somewhat too passively to the
sentence of divorce, or rather of
nullification of her marriage, as
pronounced by Cranmer, it must be
remembered that, unlike Catherine
of Aragon, she had reason to dread
the consequences of opposition to
the king’s despotic will. Her husband’s
brutal treatment of her during
the short time they lived together,
his coarse expressions of
disrespect and loathing, his utter
want of consideration towards her
as a princess, and lack of gentlemanlike
behavior towards her as a
woman and a stranger in his realm,
were enough to dispose her to consent
to any conditions which left
her alive and safe, even had she not
had before her eyes the sad experience
of several judicial murders
committed just before and after her
ill-omened wedding. Among the
strange circumstances of her&mdash;in a
sense&mdash;obscure life is this: that,
having been brought up a Lutheran,
and proposed as a wife to Henry
VIII. as a means of conciliating the
league of powerful Protestant princes
in Germany, she died a Catholic
in her adopted country. Her sister,
Sibylla, had married John
Frederick, the Elector of Saxony,
who uniformly befriended Luther.
Whether Anne’s convictions were
very strong or not it is not easy to
say; a terror of her future husband
was enough to explain her making
no demur at being married according
to the Catholic form, which was
done with great pomp and solemnity;
but she did her best while
queen to save Dr. Barnes, the Reformer,
probably on account of her
sympathy with his opinions. In
this she was unsuccessful; indeed,
she never had any influence with
the king. This is perhaps the only
decided evidence of her being attached
to the doctrines in which she
had been educated, and probably
the religious impressions she received
in England were all in favor
of Catholicity. At this time
neither court nor people had
changed in doctrine, though there
<em>was</em> a real Protestant party, quite
distinct from the king’s time-serving
prelates and obsequious courtiers.
Still, Henry was unswervingly
attached to the forms of the
church of his fathers, and in many
points to its doctrines, and, indeed,
would have been by no means flattered
by becoming the head of a
“church” without outward symbolism
and stately ceremony, such as
the hidden body of Puritans already
desired.</p>

<p>The portrait of Anne of Cleves&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
of her disposition and character&mdash;is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
very winning. Her mother,
who, says Nicolas Wotton, was
a “very wise lady, and one that very
straightly looketh to her children,”
had evidently brought her up, as
most Flemish and German girls, in
a womanly, modest, and useful fashion.
She is described as “of very
lowly and gentle conditions, by
which she hath so much won her
mother’s favor that she is very loath
to suffer her to depart from her.
She occupieth her time much with
her needle. She can read and
write her own, but French, or
Latin, or other language she knoweth
not; nor yet can sing or
play on any instrument, for they
take it here in Germany for a rebuke
and an occasion of lightness
that great ladies should be learned
or have any knowledge of musick.”</p>

<p>It is not surprising that they should
have had such a prejudice at that
time, considering how polite learning
was fast becoming the all-atoning
compensation for the lowest morals
and most shameless intrigues in the
courts of Italy, of France, and of
England. Later on the English
annalist Holinshed, who wrote of
her after her death, praised her as
“a lady of right commendable regard,
courteous, gentle, a good
housekeeper, and very bountiful to
her servants.” Of her kind heart
her will is a striking instance; for
her heart seems more set on her
“alms-children” than on any other
of her pensioners and legatees.
Herbert, the author of a short
sketch of her life, gives his opinion
as follows: “The truth is that Anne
was a fine, tall, shapely German
girl, with a good, grave, somewhat
heavy, gentle, placid face”; but he
goes on to add up her deficiencies
in beauty, style, and accomplishments,
and calls her “provincial”
as compared with the “refined,
volatile beauties of the French and
English or the stately donnas of
the Spanish courts.”</p>

<p>That she was not beautiful, and
that Henry was purposely deceived
as to her personal charms by the
short-sighted Cromwell, is undeniable.
Henry, who had so unfeelingly
discarded his once beautiful and
sprightly and his still loving, stately,
and queenly wife, Catherine of
Aragon, as soon as his wandering
fancy had fixed upon a younger
beauty, could not be expected to
feel less than a sheer disappointment
at the sight of Anne of Cleves.
So fastidious was he that he had
actually asked Francis I. of France
to send him twenty or thirty of the
most beautiful women in France,
that he might pick and choose
among them; and when the hapless
ambassador, Marillac, had respectfully
proposed that he should send
some one to the court to choose
for him, he had abruptly exclaimed
with an oath: “How can I depend
upon any one but myself?” Cromwell,
to whose political schemes
the alliance of the Schmalkalden
League (as the coalition of German
Lutheran princes was called)
was necessary, duped the king by
causing Holbein to paint a flattering
miniature of Anne. This was
enclosed in a box of ivory delicately
carved in the likeness of a white
rose, which, when the lid was unscrewed,
showed the miniature at
the bottom. Her contemporaries
vary so greatly in their reports of
her appearance that an exact description
of an original pencil-sketch
(unfinished) among the
Holbein heads in the royal collection
at Windsor may be of some
value. Miss Strickland, in her
<cite>Lives of the Queens of England</cite>,
gives it thus: “There is a moral
and intellectual beauty in the expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
of the face, though the
nose and mouth are large and
somewhat coarse in their formation.
Her forehead is lofty, expansive,
and serene, indicative of
candor and talent. The eyes are
large, dark, and reflective. They
are thickly fringed, both on the upper
and lower lids, with long, black
lashes. Her hair, which is also
black, is parted and plainly folded
on either side the face in bands,
extending below the ears&mdash;a style
that seems peculiarly suitable to
the calm and dignified composure
of her countenance.” What must
have been most to her disadvantage
was not the <em>brown</em> complexion of
which Southampton, the lord-admiral,
so dexterously spoke when
the king asked him in anger, “How
like you this woman&mdash;do you think
her so fair?” nor her heavy features,
but the marks of the small-pox,
with which she was plentifully
pitted. This, in itself, may have
materially contributed to the clumsiness
of her features. Her “progress”
from her native city of Düsseldorf
to the shores of England
lasted two months, partly from
stress of weather, which detained
her nearly three weeks at Calais,
partly from the state of the roads
and the necessary pageantry which
her own countrymen and her future
subjects tendered to her on her
way. Antwerp distinguished itself,
as usual, by a lavish display of
<em>bravery</em>. The English merchants
of that town came out four miles
to meet her, to the number of fifty,
dressed in velvet coats and chains
of gold; while at her entrance into
the town, at daylight, she was honorably
received with twice fourscore
torches. Again, we find that
she arrived at Calais between seven
and eight o’clock in the morning,
and that in mid-December. As
she is said to have travelled generally
at about the rate of twenty
English miles a day, and each of
these places, at which she arrived
so early, was made the scene of rejoicing
and feasting for her and her
train, it is evident that much of her
journey must have been performed
in the chilly hours before the dawn
of a winter’s day. In the train
sent to welcome Anne of Cleves
were kinsmen of five out of Henry’s
six queens. The time was whiled
away in the then English city of
Calais in the usual festivities, and
she was taken to see the king’s
ships <cite>Lyon</cite> and <cite>Sweepstakes</cite>, which
were decked in her honor with a
hundred banners of silk and gold,
and furnished with “two master-gunners,
mariners, thirty-one trumpets,
and a double-drum that was
never seen in England before; and
so her grace entered into Calais, at
whose entering there were one hundred
and fifty rounds of ordnance
let out of the said ships, which
made such a smoke that not one of
her train could see the other.”<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
From Dover, after a quick and
prosperous passage of the proverbially
churlish Channel, she went
to Canterbury and thence to Rochester,
where, on New Year’s eve,
1540, the king, impelled by a boyish
curiosity ill-suited to his years and
antecedents, told Cromwell that he
intended to visit the queen privately
and suddenly. So he and eight
of his attendant gentlemen dressed
themselves alike in coats of “marble
color” (probably some kind of
gray), and presented themselves in
her apartments. He was taken
aback at her appearance, and for
once “was marvellously astonished
and abashed.” It was the first
time he had had a queen proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
to him whom he had not seen beforehand,
and he felt that, at least
in the eyes of the people, he had
gone too far to be able to draw
back now. He, who had never
been taught self-restraint in anything,
was not the man to exercise
forbearance towards his luckless
bride; yet, for the first and almost
the only time, it was noticed that
he absolutely showed her some
scant civility. Either she knew him
from his portraits or the evident
prominence of one of her visitors
indicated to her who was her
future husband; for she sank on her
knees at his approach, probably
reading his surprise by her own instincts,
and wishing to propitiate
him with the meekness and deep
humility of her behavior. Still, it
was not Catherine of Aragon’s dignified
humility and Christian majesty
of demeanor, as she had pleaded
for herself as a stranger no less than
as a loving and faithful wife. The
chronicler Hall says that the king
“welcomed Anne with gracious
words, and gently took her up and
kissed her”&mdash;which is likely enough;
yet we cannot rely on Hall’s authority
as a grave historian, in after-times,
as we always find him a
gossiping and complacent relater
of court pageantries, and a blind admirer
of the king’s every word and
look. No doubt he was wise in his
generation&mdash;for what else could
contemporary historians do to save
their heads?&mdash;and after three hundred
and fifty years we are glad to
have his gorgeous <cite>Chronicles</cite> to dip
into. Strype, Lord Herbert of
Cherbury, Burnet, Lingard, and
others agree that immediately after
the king left Anne (with whom he
had supped) he angrily called his
lords together, and reproached them
with having deceived him by false
reports of her beauty; and, further,
that he sent her the New Year’s gift,
which he had intended to present
to her in person, by his master of
the horse, Sir Anthony Browne, with
a cold, formal message, excusing
himself to those about him by saying
that “she was not handsome
enough to be entitled to such an
honor” as his personal offering.</p>

<p>The French ambassador, Marillac,
preserved the record of many
little details in his sprightly but
gossiping correspondence with his
superiors during the years 1539-40.
These diplomatic gossipings seem
to have been much the fashion; for
the Venetian envoys also indulge
in them. Courts and cabinets were
more intimately connected then
than the <i lang="fr">bourgeois</i> improvements of
the later domestic life in royal circles
make it possible for them to
be now. But if the French ambassador
could be minute in his descriptions,
he was not so good an
adept at the mysteries of English
spelling. He invariably spells Greenwich
<em>Greenwigs</em>, and Westminster
<em>Valsemaistre</em>. After Henry’s discourteous
reception of his bride he
returned to his palace at the former
place, and there met the cunning
contriver of the match, Cromwell,
whom he upbraided coarsely for
having yoked him with a “great
Flanders mare.” The minister tried
to shift the blame on Southampton,
who had conducted the princess to
England; but the latter bluntly replied
that “his commission was
only to bring her to England; and
… as she was generally reputed
for a beauty, he had only repeated
the opinion of others, … and especially
as he supposed she would
be his queen.” Dealing with Henry
VIII. involved a dangerous game,
as no one knew for two days together
to whom to look as the “rising
sun.” The mild, gentle woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
who was never to have any influence,
and yet was to win all hearts
save that of the brutal king, was
perhaps an object of chivalrous pity
to the lord high admiral, who thus
prudently entrenched himself within
the safe limits of his “commission.”</p>

<p>At length, after repeated, peevish
outbursts of despotic ill-temper and
such expressions as this: “Is there,
then, no remedy but that I must
needs put my neck into the yoke?”
the king gave orders for his marriage
preparations. It is curious to
think of the now dense and unsavory
city accumulations that cover
the “fair plain” at the foot of Shooter’s
Hill, on which were pitched
the tent of cloth of gold and the
gay pavilions where the slighted
bride was publicly met and saluted
by her future husband. To do him
justice, he behaved with proper
outward respect towards her. From
Greenwich to Blackheath “the
furze and bushes” were cut down
and a clear road made, lined with
the companies of merchants, English,
Spanish, Flemish, and Italian,
in coats of embroidered velvet,
while “gentlemen pensioners” and
knights and aldermen wore massive
chains of gold. The princess and
her retinue, consisting both of her
English escort and her native attendants,
met the king at some distance
from the tent, and patiently
listened to a long Latin oration delivered
by the king’s almoner, and
answered on her behalf by another
solemn string of classical platitudes
by her brother’s learned secretary,
of neither of which speeches she
understood one word. Anne wore
a rich but somewhat tasteless dress,
cut short and round, without any
train, which rather shocked the fastidious
eyes of the French ambassador
and the English courtiers.
The king, for his fourth bridal,
wore a dress which, though rich,
must have been unbecoming to one
of his size and complexion. The
chronicler Hall describes it as a
sort of frock of <em>purple</em> velvet, “so
heavily embroidered with <em>flat gold
of damask</em> and lace that little of
the ground appeared. Chains and
guards of gold hung round his neck
and across his shoulders. The
sleeves and breast were cut and lined
with cloth of gold, and clasped
with great buttons of diamonds, rubies,
and orient pearls, … his sword
and girdle adorned with emeralds, … but
his bonnet so rich of jewels
that few men could value them; … besides
all this, he wore a collar
of such balas, rubies, and pearls that
few men ever saw the like.” He was
on horseback, but his “horse of
state” was led behind him by a rein
of gold, and wore trappings of crimson
velvet and satin embroidered
with gold. A multitude of gorgeously-dressed
pages followed, each
mounted on coursers with trappings
to match. The princess was
no less loaded with jewels, and her
horse wore trappings which, together
with the “goldsmith’s work” of the
dress of her running footmen, was
embroidered with the black lion of
the shield of Hainaut. The king
advanced and embraced her, and, to
all outward appearance, did princely
homage to her&mdash;all through an
interpreter, however; and with more
descriptions of wonderful clothes
and ornaments, the old chronicler
moves the whole pageant forward
through the park to Greenwich palace.
At one stage of the procession
the princess seems to have exchanged
her horse for a chariot of
curious, antique fashion. A prominent
place was assigned among her
retinue to her three Flemish washerwomen,
or, in the language of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
that day, her launderers. Then
followed the great water-pageant
on the Thames, where each city
guild rivalled its fellows in display,
every barge rowing up and down,
proudly showing its streamers, pensiles,
and targets, some painted with
the king’s arms, some with her
grace’s, and some with those of
their own “craft or mystery.” Then
there was a barge, made like a ship,
called the bachelor’s bark, decked
with the same streaming banners,
besides a “foyst,” or gun, “that
shot great pieces of artillery.” The
barges also bore companies of singers
and players, some concealed,
some elevated on decorated platforms.
This was the fifth time that
they had been decked for a bridal,
if we count Catherine of Aragon’s
first wedding-day, when the Prince
Arthur, who might have rivalled
his legendary namesake, received
the acclamations of a loyal people.
The loyalty must have got sadly
rusty by this time, however, as the
unwieldy, bloated king rode past
in his ghastly finery, escorting another
perspective victim to a palace
which only good-luck prevented
from becoming her prison. Again
Henry gave Cromwell ominous
hints of his distaste to Anne of
Cleves, as on the evening of this
holiday he asked his opinion of
her beauty. Cromwell answered
that she had a queenly manner;
and for Henry, whose two beheaded
favorites, Anne Boleyn and Catherine
Howard, chiefly offended
him by their indiscreet and familiar
behavior, this ought to have been
a source of satisfaction; yet even
on that last day of his liberty he
called his council together, and despotically
ordered them to see if
he could not, by any quibble, get
rid of his bargain with the despised
princess. Doubtless the indignity
would have seemed rather a boon
to the royal Griselda; but, such as
it was, it was not granted. Things
had gone too far. The Schmalkalden
League might resent the insult; the
English people, with their rough
love of “fair play,” might even rise
in insurrection. Tudorism had
scarcely yet advanced to absolute
Mahometanism, and the council decided
that the marriage must take
place. Henry sullenly acquiesced,
but Cromwell’s fate was sealed.
“I am not well handled,” exclaimed
the king more than once, and
alleged that his bride had been betrothed
to the Prince of Lorraine in
her childhood, though Anne, when
required, solemnly denied that at
present she was bound by any pre-contract.
This she was forced to
do in public before the whole
council. When the marriage was
fixed for the feast of the Epiphany,
1540, Henry, ignoring the right
of her own countrymen, Overstein
and Hostoden, to give her away,
associated one of his subjects,
Lord Essex, in the office which by
every right, of custom as well as
feeling, belonged only to the representatives
of her family. The bridal
robes were a repetition of the gorgeous
apparel already described; but
the <em>round</em> dress of the bride seems
ungainly. She wore her long, luxuriant
yellow hair flowing down her
shoulders, says Hall; but, as in her
portrait her eyes and hair are dark,
Miss Strickland suggests that these
“golden locks” were false. The
contrast must have been unfavorable.
On her coronal “were set
sprigs of rosemary, an herb of grace,
which was used by maidens, both at
weddings and funerals, for <i lang="fr">souvenance</i>,”
say some MSS. of that day.</p>

<p>The marriage was performed at
Greenwich by Cranmer, Archbishop
of Canterbury, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
rites of the Catholic Church. There
was a solemn Mass, at the Offertory
of which the king and queen went
up to the altar and offered tapers.
Then, returning to the gallery, they
took wine and spices (<i>i.e.</i>, comfits
and preserves), and at nine in the
morning (the marriage had been at
eight o’clock) dined together. There
was something terribly incongruous
in the schismatic king, excommunicated
for adultery, and the passive
Lutheran princess, being joined
together in matrimony by an archbishop
whose <em>complaisant</em> character
and loose morals made many, even
of that day, consider him a false
shepherd. And add to this that
Queen Anne died a Catholic, and
had as her chaplain and confessor
a Spaniard, whom it is permissible
to identify with the same Tomeo
who was once in the service of the
holy Queen Catherine of Aragon.
The wedding-ring which Henry
gave to his third and last lawful
wife<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> had this motto engraved on
it: “God send me weel to kepe,”
in Old-English letters. In the evening
of the wedding-day the royal
pair attended Vespers in state and
then supped together. These meals
must have been characterized by
the same barbarous etiquette as
those on the occasion of Anne
Boleyn’s coronation, during which
we are told: “And under the table
went two gentlewomen and sat at the
queen’s feet during the dinner.”
Their office was to hold the queen’s
handkerchief, gloves, etc. Sometimes
there were as many as four of
these attendants. The queen publicly
washed her hands in a silver
basin full of scented water, and the
basin and ewer were both held
by the great dignitaries of the
realm. Two countesses stood one
on each side, “holding a fine cloth
before the queen’s face whenever
she listed to spit or do otherwise
at her pleasure”&mdash;a most extraordinary
office, but probably so old
as to be still in form indispensable
in that land of <em>precedents</em> and of
tenacity concerning all old customs.</p>

<p>Anne’s short days with her ungallant
husband were a sad trial to
her; she never gained his affections
nor acquired influence with him.
She was too true to feign a love she
did not feel or to use adulation to
conquer power. Henry complained
to Cromwell that she “waxed
wilful and stubborn with him”; and
her partial biographer, Miss Strickland,
says of her: “Anne was no
adept in the art of flattery, and,
though really of ‘meek and gentle
conditions,’ she did not humiliate
herself meanly to the man from
whom she had received so many
unprovoked marks of contempt.”</p>

<p>The king, whether from ironical
or politic motives, still called her
“sweetheart” and “darling” before
the ladies of her bed-chamber, but
was already meditating a divorce.
Their last public appearance together
was at the jousts at Durham
House, where a company of knights
in white velvet took part in a tournament
and a feast of good cheer
which the king and queen honored
with their presence. This was on
the first of May, after they had
been married but four months.
The queen, whose conduct was so
irreproachable that her direst enemy
could find no link in this “armor
of proof,” occupied her time in
embroidery and needlework with
her maids of honor, as the meek
but dignified Catherine of Aragon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
had done, both in the days of her
power and in those of her distress.
Saving the beauty which had once
been his first wife’s portion, and the
majesty of character which never
left her to her dying day, his third
consort must have reminded him
of the pure, domestic tie which had
been his in his youth, of the blameless,
gentle, yet stately courtesies
in which his court had rejoiced
under the sway of a <em>royal</em> mistress.
But the unhappy Catherine had
loved him, while the more passive
Anne simply endured him. Even
this was a surprise and a vexation
to him, as appeared a few weeks
later, when, on hearing that she
gladly assented to the divorce, he
wondered that she was so ready to
part with him. When her ladies ventured
to ask her if she had told
“mother Lowe,” her confidential
nurse and countrywoman, how the
king neglected her, she answered
truthfully, “Nay, I have not; but I
receive quite as much of his majesty’s
attention as I wish.” Henry
meanwhile encouraged her English
ladies to mimic and ridicule her
in her dress, her foreign accent, her
want of learning. He openly said
that he had never given his <em>inward
consent</em> to the marriage; that he
feared he had wronged the Prince
of Lorraine, to whom he persisted
in considering her as “precontracted”;
and further had the assurance
to prate of his <em>conscientious scruples</em>
as to marriage with a Lutheran!<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
But the plotter whose schemes her
marriage had served was doomed
to fall before her. Cromwell was
arrested a few days before she was
dismissed from the court on the
pretext of her health requiring
change of air. She was banished
to Richmond; he was confined in
the Tower. The facile Cranmer for
the third time “dissolved” a marriage
he had made, and, obeying
Henry’s changeful whims, pronounced
<em>both parties</em> free to marry
again. But the liberty so formally
granted was by no means to be
literally understood as regarded
the queen. “The particulars of
this transaction (the divorce),” says
Miss Strickland, “show in a striking
manner the artfulness and injustice
of the king and the slavishness
of his ministers and subjects.”
A so-called convocation reviewed
the case and pronounced the
divorce, on the grounds already
mentioned, dictated by the king,
and the House of Lords cringingly
passed the necessary bill. The
very same Southampton who had
escorted Anne of Cleves to England
bore the message to her depriving
her of her royal state. She
swooned at first, thinking that the
deputation had come to pronounce
sentence of death upon her. As
soon as she understood that her life
was safe she showed an alacrity in
stripping herself of her dangerous
honors, which of itself was perhaps
more dangerous. However, the
king was too busy with his new
toy-victim, the wretched Catherine
Howard, to take notice of these
symptoms of Anne’s joy at her
safety. The terms were simply
honorable imprisonment. She was
not to leave the realm, and, in
reality, was kept as a hostage for
the good behavior of her relatives
abroad, who might otherwise have
been tempted to resent her wrongs.
Here begins the uniqueness of her
lot. She was adopted as the king’s
“sister,” was to resign the title of
queen, but to have precedence at
court over every other lady, save
the king’s future “wife” and his
two daughters, and to be amply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
provided for out of the royal treasury.
With Mary and Elizabeth
she was on the most friendly terms,
and at the beginning of her marriage
endeavored, by every means in her
power, to bring the neglected Mary
into notice. From Anne’s expressions
in her letters to her brother
it appears that any hostile demonstration
on his part to revenge her
would have brought evil on her.
She says: “Only I require this of
you: that ye so conduct yourself as
for your untowardness in this matter
I fare not the worse, whereunto
I trust you will have regard.”
She humbly returned her wedding-ring
to her dictatorial husband,
and wrote a letter of submission
in German, which the councillors
sent to him in translation.
A handsome maintenance was allotted
her, and she evidently took
kindly to her new position, even
cheerfully acquiescing in the command
to receive no letters or messages
from her kindred. Thus the
leave to “marry again” was in her
case evidently only a matter of
form. The king had the boldness
to allude to her “caprice” as a
woman, which might make her
break these promises, and the
meanness to order that measures
should be taken to prevent the possibility
of her breaking them. These
are his words&mdash;a monument of despicable
tyranny: “And concerning
these letters to her brother, how
well soever she speaketh now, with
promises, to abandon the condition
[caprice] of a woman, … we
think good, nevertheless, rather by
good means to prevent that she
should not play the woman <em>than to
depend upon her promise</em>; <em>nor, after
she have felt at our hand all gratuity
and kindness</em>, … to leave her
at liberty, to gather more stubbornness
than were expedient, … she
should not play the woman [<i>i.e.</i>,
change her mind] if she would.…
Unless these letters be obtained,
all shall [<i>i.e.</i>, will] remain
uncertain upon a woman’s promise&mdash;that
she will be no woman&mdash;the
accomplishment whereof, on her
behalf, is as difficult in the refraining
of a woman’s will, upon occasion,
as in changing her womanish
nature, which is impossible.”<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>Marillac, the ambassador, says
on this occasion that “the queen
takes it all in good part.” But the
people had evidently grown to love
her, and, as far as they dared, murmured
at the indignity put upon
her; for he adds: “This is cause of
great regret to the people, whose
love she had gained, and who esteemed
her as one of the most
sweet, gracious, and humane queens
they have had; and they greatly desired
her to continue with them as
their queen.” No doubt the people
had a greater sense of dignity
than their king, and wished the
sovereign lady of so great a realm
to be of royal race and breeding.
It was not for them to be subjects
of a subject, while foreign kingdoms,
and even small principalities, had
queens-consort of royal degree.
They had had sad experience, too,
of the desolating rivalries produced
among the great lords by these intermarriages
with subjects, and
therefore welcomed the gentle foreigner,
so quick to learn English
speech and English ways, but
whose kindred was little likely to
embarrass them.</p>

<p>Anne always signed herself
“Daughter of Cleves” after her
dismissal from court, and her gayety
seems to have revived as soon as
she found her life safe. Scarcely
a month after the divorce was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
pronounced Henry visited her at
Richmond, and she entertained
him so pleasantly, says Marillac,
that he stayed and supped with her
“right merrily, and demeaned himself
with such singular graciousness
that some … fancied he was
going to take her for his queen
again.” If his hostess had thought
so, doubtless she would have abated
her pleasant humor and appeared
less ready to welcome him. As it
was, she put on every day a rich
new dress, “each more wonderful
than the last,” fared sumptuously,
held her little court like a noble
English lady of that day, dispensing
alms and bounties, and passing her
time, as Marillac says, “in sports
and recreations.” Her real self
bloomed again in this atmosphere
of safety and unrestricted mental
freedom; for such this “honorable
imprisonment” as a hostage certainly
was when compared with the
teasing, daily companionship with
the treacherous king. A feint was
made a little later to give her a
choice as to whether she would
live in England or abroad; but as
the jointure was tied up in English
lands and their revenue alone, and
to the possessor of these residence
in England was attached as a <i lang="la">sine
qua non</i> condition, the liberty of
choice was practically null.</p>

<p>Anne’s court at Richmond and
her life of gentle charities and
innocent merry-makings were suddenly
startled, after sixteen months’
peace, by the news of the trial and
execution of her unhappy successor,
Catherine Howard. Immediately
her partisan maids of honor,
and indeed all her household, who
were devoted to her, began to speculate
as to the chances of Providence
interfering to reinstate their mistress
in her rights. Every one but
herself wished for this restoration.
One of her ladies was actually committed
to prison for having said,
“Is God working his own work to
make the Lady Anne of Cleves
queen again?” adding that it was
impossible that so sweet a queen as
Lady Anne could be utterly put
down. But, fortunately for the
queen’s peace of mind, there was
no such possibility, even though her
brother’s ambassadors rather inconsiderately
urged her restoration to
her rightful position. The Privy-Purse
expenses of her step-daughter,
the Princess Mary, mentions a visit
made by her to Anne in the year
1543 and her largesses to the latter’s
servants; also a present of
Spanish silk sent by Anne to Mary.
Their intercourse seems to have
been pleasant and familiar; they
were nearly of the same age and
had many domestic tastes in common.
The contact between them
may have been in part the means
of Anne’s becoming a Catholic,
though there is but little to show
at what precise time this took place.
So English had the queen grown
that when Henry died, in 1547, she
did not care to go to her own country,
but willingly cast in her lot
with her adopted land. Wise in
her widowhood, as she had been
virtuous in her married life&mdash;no less
during the seven years of her separation
than the six months of her
reign&mdash;she did not marry again nor
in any way mix in political matters.
Posterity has unjustly set her down
as an ugly, ill-conditioned, unlearned
woman, a person without taste
and discernment, at best a mere
puppet of Henry’s. But we venture
to see her otherwise; though
she may not have been learned like
Mary Tudor or Jane Grey, she
was yet sufficiently instructed in all
womanly arts, and quickly learned
English, adapting herself, with rare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
prudence and discretion, to the
ways of life and even the gorgeous
sports of her adopted land; a trustworthy
friend to the king’s daughters,
especially the spurned and ill-fated
Mary; a benevolent and self-denying
woman, a good mistress, a
pleasant hostess, an admirable manager
of her tenants, estates, and
household, deft with her fingers,
skilful at her needle, gentle towards
all, and, though not handsome,
yet so winning that her ladies&mdash;though
it was the worst policy&mdash;had
no other title for her than their
“sweet queen,” their “dear lady,”
their “sweet mistress.” She outlived
her stepson, Edward VI., and
assisted publicly at Mary’s coronation,
sitting in the same chariot as
Elizabeth. “But,” says Miss Strickland,
“her happiness appears to
have been in the retirement of domestic
life.” Further on the same
biographer adds that it has been
surmised, from certain items in her
list of expenses, that she sometimes
made private experiments in cooking.
“She spent her time at the
head of her little court, which was
a happy household within itself, and
we may presume well governed; for
we hear neither of plots, nor quarrels,
tale-bearings nor mischievous
intrigues, as rife in her home-circle.
She was tenderly beloved by her
domestics, and well attended by
them in her last sickness.” She
survived her husband ten years, and
died calmly and happily at the age
of forty-one. In her will she left
almost all the money and jewels
which she had at her disposal to
those who had served her and to
poor pensioners, besides scrupulously
ordering every debt to be
paid. She left marriage-portions
for her maids of honor, and ended
by beseeching her executors to
“pray for us and to see our body
buried, … that we may have the
suffrages of holy church according
to the Catholic faith, wherein we
end our life in this transitory
world.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, Queen Mary had
her buried in Westminster Abbey
with great pomp, and the procession
was graced with a hundred of
her servants bearing torches, many
knights and gentlemen with eight
banners of arms (her own) and four
banners of “white taffeta wrought
with gold,” then the twelve bedesmen
of Westminster in new black
gowns, bearing twelve burning
torches and four white branches, her
ladies on horseback and in black
gowns, and eight heralds, with
white banners of arms, riding
near the hearse. At the abbey-door
the abbot and other Catholic
dignitaries in mitres and
copes received the corpse with the
usual solemn ceremonies, and, bringing
her into the church, “tarried
dirge, and all the night with lights
burning.” This stands for the
Vespers in the Office for the departed.
“The next day,” says the
chronicler Stow, “requiem was sung,
and my lord of Westminster (the
abbot) preached as goodly a sermon
as ever was made, and the
Bishop of London sang Mass in his
mitre, … and all the gentlemen and
ladies offered [alms] at Mass.…
Then all her head officers brake
their staves, and all her ushers
brake their rods and cast them into
her tomb, … and thus they went
in order to a great dinner given by
my lord of Winchester to all the
mourners.”</p>

<p>There was more rest and peace
in this funeral pageant than there
had been in the ill-omened wedding
ceremony of which she had been
the object seventeen years before.
Her tomb is near the high altar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
Westminster Abbey, at the feet of
King Sebert, the original Saxon
founder, before the restoration of
the abbey by Edward the Confessor.
It is a plain-looking slab, like a
bench, placed against the wall, and
on parts of the unfinished structure
the curious inquirer can trace her
initials, A. and C., interwoven; but,
such as it is, it is more of a memorial
than fell to the lot of any of
Henry’s queens, not one of whom,
says Stow, “had a monument, except
Anne of Cleves, and hers was
but half a one.”</p>

<p>The horror felt on the Continent
for the excesses and cruelty of the
Bluebeard of England was such
that it was long believed that Anne
had either died by unfair means or
had escaped from her “cruel imprisonment.”
An impostor, therefore,
for a time was enabled to take
her place at one of the German
courts&mdash;that of Coburg, where she
was treated with royal consideration&mdash;but
the fraud was afterwards
discovered. This is mentioned in
Shobert’s <cite>History of the House of
Saxony</cite>. Upon the whole, Anne of
Cleves may be considered as the
most fortunate among the many
women whose lives were connected
with that of King Henry VIII.</p>

<h3>THE ROMAN RITUAL AND ITS CHANT<br />
<i>COMPARED WITH THE WORKS OF MODERN MUSIC.</i><a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a><br />
INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<h4>ON THE DIVINE IDEA.</h4>

<div class="hanging">

<p><i>The Divine Idea, the Exemplar or Pattern,
in conformity with which the intellect
and free will of man, and whatever is
their combined work, finds its perfection.</i></p>

</div>

<p>All persons are familiar with the
expression “beau ideal,” and in
judging of matters of taste nothing
is more common than to appeal to
the standard of an “ideal”; as, for
instance, the statue of the “Apollo
Belvedere” would be, and is commonly
said to realize, the “ideal”
of the human form. Of course the
ideal thus appealed to, as existing
generally in the minds of persons
of education, is nothing in itself
absolutely certain or determinate.
But, as far as it goes, it is a natural
indication that the standard and
measure of all perfection is an
“ideal.” For we see that an ideal
which is generally recognized and
acknowledged by persons of taste
and refinement does, in point of
fact, come to be a standard, the authority
of which is accepted to a
great extent by others.</p>

<p>What is, then, in a measure true
of an “ideal” subsisting in the
mind of persons of education, as a
standard of perfection, must be infinitely
true of the idea of creation
subsisting in the mind of God from
all eternity. But as this leads to
a speculative portion of Christian
philosophy which can scarcely be
deemed popular, and might perhaps
give rise in some minds to the feeling
“parturiunt montes,” if they
found that an abstruse foundation
had been formally laid only for the
superstructure of a discussion upon
plain chant, the few remarks that
have seemed necessary to explain
and justify the ground on which
the ensuing essay proceeds have
been collected together, and are
here given in the form of an introduction,
for the sake of burdening
the discussion as little as possible
with reasoning that does not properly
belong to it.</p>

<p>All creation, according to Catholic
theology, is the work of the ever-blessed
Trinity. For only inasmuch
as the Godhead subsisting in
a Trinity of persons is for itself a
perfect and undivided whole (κοσμος
τελειος) can God bring into
being a creation external to himself,
without becoming himself the
world which he creates.</p>

<p>To God the Father theologians
assign the eternal idea, or the conception
from all eternity of the
idea or form of creation;</p>

<p>To God the Son, the realization
of the idea of the Father, or the act
of bringing created things into being
out of nothing, in conformity
with the idea of the Father;</p>

<p>To God the Holy Ghost, the
bringing creation to its perfection
through the period of its development
or growth.</p>

<p>S. Basil speaks to this effect in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
the following passage: “In the
creation I regard the Father as the
first cause of created being, the Son
as the creating cause, and the Holy
Ghost as the perfecting cause. So
that spirits, through the will of
the Father, are called into actual
being through the operation of
the Son, and are brought to perfection
by the presence of the Holy
Spirit. Let no one, however, think
either that I assume the existence
of three original substances or that
I call the operation of the Son imperfect.
For there is but one first
principle (αρχη), which creates
through the Son and brings to perfection
through the Holy Ghost”
(<cite>De Spiritu Sancto</cite>, c. 16).</p>

<p>The work, then, of God the Father
was the eternal idea of all
creation; in the language of S. Gregory
Nazianzen, εννοει ὁ πατηρ&mdash;και
το εννοημα (idea) ἐργον ην,
λογῳ συμπληρουμενον και
πνευματι τελειουμενον (<cite>Orat.</cite>
xxxviii. n. 9); and this thought or
idea was a work brought into reality
by the Word, and brought to perfection
by the Spirit.</p>

<p>The eternal idea of creation is
thus explained by S. Thomas, <cite>Summa</cite>,
p. i. quæst. xv. art. 1 (<cite>Utrum
ideæ sint</cite>):</p>

<p>“I answer that it is necessary to
suppose ideas in the mind of God.
Idea is a Greek word, and answers
to the Latin <i lang="la">forma</i>, form. Whence
by the term ideas we understand
the forms of things that exist
external (<i lang="la">præter</i>) to the things
themselves. The form of a thing
existing external to it may serve
two purposes: 1. That it should
be the exemplar (ideal) of that of
which it is said to be the form, or
that it should be, as it were, the
principle of knowledge itself, according
to which the forms of
things that may be known are said
to exist in the understanding. And
in either point of view it is necessary
to suppose ideas, as will be at
once manifest. In all things that
are not generated by chance, it is
necessary that the production of
some form should be the result of
the act of generation. For an agent
would not act with reference to a
particular form, except so far as he
was already in possession of the likeness
of the form in question. In some
agents the form of the thing to be produced
already pre-exists in a natural
manner (<i lang="la">secundum esse naturale</i>), as
in those things which act by natural
laws; but in others the form
pre-exists in the intellect (<i lang="la">secundum
esse intelligibile</i>). Thus the likeness
or form of a house already exists in
the mind of the builder, and this
may be called the idea of a house;
for the architect intends to make
the house resemble the form which
he has conceived in his mind. As,
then, the world is not made by
chance, it follows that there must
exist a <em>form</em> (idea) in the mind of
God, after the likeness of which the
world was made.”</p>

<p>Quite similar to these words of
S. Thomas are the statements of S.
Augustine, Dionysius, and other fathers,
who had to deal on the one
hand with the philosophy of Plato,
which taught that God created the
world out of eternal matter, and
according to an exemplar or ideal
existing externally to himself (κοσμος
νοητος); and on the other
with the Gnostic Pantheism, which
taught that the divine idea after
which the world was created was
identical with God, and creation
consequently no more than an extension
or manifestation of the Godhead.</p>

<p>Similar also is the following passage
of the Abate Rosmini:</p>

<p>“‘Fide intelligimus aptata esse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
secula verbo Dei, ut ex invisibilibus
visibilia fierent’ (Heb. xi. 3). What
ever are these invisible things from
which the things that are visible
have been drawn? They are the
conceptions of the Almighty, which
subsisted in his mind before the
creation of the universe; they are
the decrees which he has framed
from all eternity, but which remained
invisible to all creatures, because
these latter were not yet formed
and the former not yet carried into
execution. These decrees and conceptions
are the design of the wise
Architect, according to which the
building has to be formed. But
this design was never at any time
drawn out on any external material,
on paper or stone, but existed
only in his own mind” (Rosmini,
<cite>Della Divina Providenza</cite>, ed. Milano,
1846, p. 57).</p>

<p>Creation proceeds from the
thought and will of God jointly exercised,
and is something external
to God, which he has brought into
being out of absolute nothing,
to quote Professor Staudenmaier:
“The world is God’s idea of the
world brought into being, and the
perfection of the original world consisted
in the fact that it absolutely
corresponded to the divine idea”
(<cite>Die Lehre von der Idee</cite>, p. 914). “Et
vidit Deus quod esset bonum” (Gen.
i. 10).</p>

<p>The creation which we see, and
of which we are ourselves immediately
a part, bears the appearance
of being an organized system, far
outreaching the powers of our intelligence;
and we conclude intuitively
that not only as an organized
whole it answers to the idea
of God, which contemplated system,
order, harmony, and subordination
of parts, but, further, that every
several part, as it came forth from
the hand of the Creator, was found
good. In creation there are two
principal parts, the material world
and the world of spirits. Matter,
from the first instant of creation,
being without free will or mind,
necessarily obeys the laws of its
Creator, and at once absolutely
answers to the divine idea. But
spirits were created in the image
of God, and were endowed with the
likeness of his power of thought
and will, and with a personality resulting
from the possession of these
gifts. To them, therefore, there is
a moral trial or probation to be
passed through before they finally
correspond to the idea of their
Creator. It is indeed true that
from the instant of their creation
they realize the divine idea, in so
far as that idea contemplates them,
about to enter upon probation; but
their passing through this trial or
probation to the attainment of
their perfection is also contemplated,
and of this perfection the divine
idea is the exemplar or form.</p>

<p>Spirits, then, formed in the image
of God, and endowed with created
being, intellect, and will, in the
present system of creation, pass
through probation; and their probation
consists in learning to possess
these gifts in subordination to
their Creator, who is absolute being,
intellect, and will; and this trial is
necessary to the perfection of their
nature and to their passing into the
possession of their permanent place
(ταξις) in the great order and
harmony of the universe. There is
not, and cannot be, in the mind of
God, any idea of evil. Evil has its
sole origin in the rebellion of the
created spirit when it refuses to
possess and use its power of thought
and will in subordination to the
law and majesty of its Creator. And
hence, although the rebel spirit answered
equally with others at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
first moment of its creation to the
divine idea, yet, inasmuch as in its
subsequent career it has placed itself
against its Creator, it has ceased
to answer to the divine idea; it
has become a contradiction to it,
and henceforward its existence is
evil.</p>

<p>The case as regards the human
creation does not differ at all in
principle. Man is also a spirit,
though his spirit be united to a
body, and he is possessed of the
same trinity of gifts&mdash;being, thought,
and will&mdash;although from the circumstance
of his coming into the world
in the form of an infant, with his
intellect and will in a state of germ,
appointed to acquire their natural
maturity only in process of time,
his probation would seem to require
a longer period than that of the
angels, and to be subject to the
fluctuation of rebellions, succeeded
by repentances, and <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>&mdash;all
which hardly seems probable in
their case. Still man, like the
angels, passes through his probation;
and when he has passed
through it, he is found either realizing
the idea of his Creator, and
happy, or fallen from it, and henceforward
in contradiction with it,
for an eternity of misery. The
idea of the Creator is to man, as
well as to the angels, the exemplar,
or pattern, of his perfection.</p>

<p>Analogous to the first creation
of the world is the second great
work of God&mdash;the redemption or
new creation. Its decree is from
God the Father; the carrying into
effect the Father’s decree is the
work of God the Eternal Son; and
the conducting it to perfection during
the period of its growth and
probation is the work of the Holy
Ghost.</p>

<p>Nor is this work of redemption
based upon any fundamental change
in the eternal idea of God, after
which man was created. The eternal
idea of God is incapable of
change, and the work of grace or
redemption is the restoration to a
state of grace of the whole race,
which, in the person of Adam, fell
into a condition of helpless although
not total contradiction with the divine
idea; and in his restored state
of redemption the power has been
again given to him of issuing out
of his probation through the aid
and guidance of the Holy Ghost,
conformable to the unchanged, eternal
idea of the Father.</p>

<p>To prevent misconception, it
may be further remarked, in the
words of Professor Staudenmaier,
“The second creation (or scheme
of redemption) builds itself, on the
one side, on <em>all that is indestructible</em>
in the divine idea of man, as intelligence
and freedom, and at the
same time labors to restore again
that which was really lost by the
original transgression, viz., the supernatural
principle and the justice
and holiness of life which stands in
connection with it. Hence under
the scheme of redemption man
comes to the perfection of his nature,
in the manner in which that
perfection was contemplated in the
divine idea (<i lang="de">in der Idee gesetz war</i>),
viz., as the union of grace and free
will (<i lang="de">in der Einheit von Freiheit und
Gnade</i>).” (<cite>Die Lehre von der Idee</cite>,
p. 923).</p>

<p>The divine idea, then, is the exemplar
or pattern of perfection
(προορισμος παραδειγμα, forma
seu exemplar, <i lang="de">das Musterbild</i>) which,
under the scheme of redemption,
man is called to realize. And his
term of probation, under the guidance
and influence of God the Holy
Ghost, is so constituted as to be
the trial of both his intellect and
will, which in man, as in God, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
mutually co-operating and co-ordinate
springs of action. But though
in man intellect and will must ever
move hand in hand and in mutual
concert to determine his actions,
yet it is possible for him to go
astray through the special fault of
one or the other, and to be found
at the end of his probation not to
be what he might and ought to
have been, as well through some special
error of the understanding as
through some vicious act of the
will. Hence, after that the sacrifice
had been paid which purchased
man’s restoration to a state of
grace, God the Father, in the Son
and through the Eternal Spirit,
went on to provide the aid that was
found absolutely necessary to protect
the erring intellect and the infirm
will, in order that men might
be preserved in the state of grace,
be guided in it onward to their
perfection, and be furnished with
the medicinal means of restoration
in case they might fall from it.</p>

<p>To this end the great society of
the Catholic Church was instituted
by God the Son, and the command
given to the Apostolic College to go
forth to collect and organize it out
of all the nations of the earth: “As
the Father hath sent me, so send I
you”; while the work of God the
Holy Ghost is the invisible imparting
of spiritual gifts to the baptized
members of this society, according
to the needs of their rank, position,
ministry, and functions; and the
whole work is directed to the end
that man may issue out of his probation
fulfilling and realizing the
divine idea.</p>

<p>Now, as God recognizes, in the
probation of man, the trial of both
intellect and will, and wills that not
without the free exercise of these
he should attain the perfection of
his nature, our first parents, in the
state of innocence, would, from
their then enjoying a communication
with heaven, possess, perhaps,
partly through intuition, partly
from revelation, a knowledge of the
divine Exemplar, into conformity
with which they were called to
bring themselves. But when man
fell and lost the illumination of
sanctifying grace, then the perception
of the divine ideal would be
obscured and would cease to exist,
except in the way of the few mercifully-surviving
glimpses of their
higher destination, which the history
of our fallen race seems to indicate
were never wholly lost.</p>

<p>It must be obvious, then, that a
clear and practical view of the divine
Exemplar, which we are required
to resemble, is as much the natural
guide of the intellect in its
probation as the view of the moral
attributes of God is that which wins
the heart and leads captive the
will. It was, among other reasons,
in order to place this Exemplar before
us, that the Eternal Son became
man, and thus laid before the intellect
of man, in his own most sacred
humanity, the incarnate Exemplar
of that which humanity was to aim
at becoming during the course and
at the issue of its probation. And
if a doubt could for a moment cross
the mind as to the question, What
is the likeness or ideal that a
Christian, as far as the power is
given to him, should seek to aim at
bringing himself to resemble? it is
answered by the fact of the Incarnation
of the Son of God. He is
the incarnate Exemplar, or Pattern,
for our study. His sacred humanity
absolutely answers to the idea
of God the Father; and they who,
through the aid of God the Holy
Ghost, succeed in acquiring a resemblance
to this incarnate Pattern,
will be found at the issue of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
probation so far to realize the
end for which they were created.</p>

<p>The sacred humanity of the Eternal
Son being now no longer visible
in the same manner as in the days
when he taught with his apostles in
Judæa, the church which he has
founded has come to supply his
place, and, by her varied means of
instruction, to bring the knowledge
of this divine Exemplar home to
the minds of all. In the words of
an author quoted by Professor
Möhler, the church is a continuation
of Christ (<i lang="de">ein fortgesetzer
Christus</i>).</p>

<p>And thus with the question of
Christian song. The intellect must
at once feel that it needs a guide,
and cannot be safely entrusted to
itself. Nor can this guide be any
other than the divine idea. And
here, of course, it would be a manifest
impiety for a human mind to
attempt to construct, <i lang="la">à priori</i>, an
idea of music, and then to call its
own work the divine idea; for the
whole value of the inquiry that is
to follow is built on the truth that
the main features and the subsequently-detailed
constituent parts
of the divine idea, as they have
been laid down, are what they
claim to be; and so far as these
are capable of being disputed, the
comparison will of course fail of
its effect. Professor Staudenmaier
justly observes, in treating of the
creation, “Both ideas, the divine
and the human, stand in this relation
to each other: that God realizes
his own eternal idea of the
world in the act of creation, while
man has to acquire his idea of the
world from reasoning and an experimental
examination of the world
as it exists after creation. As the
idea, then, to God is the first, and
the world last, so, on the contrary,
to man the world is first and the
idea last, as that, namely, which he
has had to gain for himself, as the
result of a scientific examination
of the divine work” (<cite>Die Christliche
Dogmatik</cite>, vol. iii. part 1, p. 42.)</p>

<p>But if it be possible for the human
mind to obtain a view of the
divine idea of the creation from the
study of the world as it exists, it
must be also possible, in an analogous
manner, to gain a view of the
divine idea of Christian music from
the history of the church and the
legislation of councils, from the doctrine
of the apostles and fathers of
the church, and, lastly, from the
reason of the thing. The contrary
supposition would involve the inadmissible
alternative that our divine
Redeemer, who had done so much
to furnish our understanding with
its needed measure of guidance in
the fact of his Incarnation and his
living example, has left us without
any principle at all to serve as our
guide in the choice and employment
of sacred music. This cannot
be. The divine Teacher of mankind
cannot, for his mercy’s sake, have
left us to ourselves in so important
a matter, that so much concerns the
adoration he has himself taught us
to pay to his Father and the Holy
Spirit. It must be possible, from
his own sacred words, from those
of his inspired apostles, from the
doctrine of the fathers, from the
history and legislation of the church,
as well as from our own Christian
reason and instinct, as has been
humbly and imperfectly attempted
in the ensuing inquiry, to gather a
view of the divine idea sufficiently
clear and intelligible, sufficiently
trustworthy and decisive, to serve
as a guide for the understandings
of those who feel the deep and dear
interest of the question and their
own liability to fatal error, with all
its destructive consequences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p>And if the means of acquiring
such a view be open, it need not
be said how great a duty there is
to search for it; and in whatever
proportion there be ground for believing
that it has been, even though
imperfectly, attained, it becomes so
far a duty&mdash;an element in our probation,
as well as a sacred and
meritorious work, by every tender,
considerate, legitimate, and untiring
endeavor, to seek to bring Catholic
Church music into conformity
with it.</p>

<h4>I.<br />
<span class="smaller">GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE BASIS OF
THE COMPARISON.</span></h4>

<p>It would be surely a superfluous
labor at the outset of an inquiry
which it is desirable should be as
short and condensed as possible to
prove, in a learned manner, the
great practical importance of the
question, What, under our present
circumstances, is the wisest, the
best, and the most effectual use
of music in the Catholic Church?
The œcumenical and provincial
councils that have made ritual
chant the subject of their legislation;
the authors, such as Cardinal
Bona and Abbot Gerbertus, subsequent
to the Council of Trent, not
to speak of those who lived before
it, who spent their lives in the study
of all that Christian antiquity
has thought and written upon it;
the line of illustrious Roman pontiffs
who made it their study, with
a view to the true direction of its
use in the church, need but to be
recalled to mind to place in its
true light the exceedingly practical
importance of any controversy
which affects its efficiency or mode
of employment in the Catholic
Church.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Moreover, if there were
no such evidence of the importance
of the question at issue to be found
in the history of the past, still the
mere obvious fact that vocal music
enters so naturally into all the feelings
of humanity, and domesticates itself
so easily in every people, would be
sufficient to explain its importance.
People in any society are so insensibly
moulded by all that surrounds
them, are so much the creatures of
the system in which they move,
and grow up so naturally in conformity
with it, that in such a society
as the Catholic Church, organized
by a divine wisdom, with a
view to the training and instruction
of its members, it is simply impossible
that an agency such as music,
possessed of such power for good
or evil, could ever be regarded with
indifference, or that there should
be no definite views with regard to
it, and its employment be abandoned
to the indiscretion and caprice
of individuals.</p>

<p>A question of individual taste,
then, the present inquiry cannot
for an instant be considered. Indeed,
from the moment it were thus
regarded it would have lost its
whole value. Persons are no doubt
to be found who would take a long
journey and pay a large sum to
hear Beethoven’s music for the Ordinary
of the Mass sung among the
performances of a music-meeting,
who, as far as music was concerned,
and setting aside the miracle, would
hardly care to go across the street
to hear S. Gregory sing Mass with
his school of cantors, were they all
to rise from the dead. So that if
music in the Catholic Church could
for a moment be considered as belonging
of right to the dominion of
individual taste, further controversy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
it is plain, would be so far quite
out of the question. The tastes of
individuals, if not only devoid of
rule, still do not go by any rule
sufficiently clear to be made the
subject of a formal controversy.</p>

<p>But in the Catholic Church the
question is not, and cannot be, one
of individual taste. When the divine
Redeemer called his church to
the work of training every nation
and people under heaven, and gave
to it the gift of sacred song, to be
used as a powerful auxiliary agency
in their work, we are bound to conceive
that there existed in his divine
mind a clear and definite intention,
both relatively to the end
it was intended to accomplish in the
midst of Christian society, and to
its application to this end as time
should advance.</p>

<p>Sacred song has certainly a
mission to accomplish upon earth,
as well as the proper manner of its
application to its proposed end;
and both alike have been, in common
with the whole work of creation,
from the beginning contemplated
and intended by Almighty
God.</p>

<p>Now, the end intended by Almighty
God, in his work of redemption
in this world, as say theologians,
is primarily the manifestation
of his own glory; and, secondarily,
the re-establishment of order and
virtue, piety and sanctity, in human
society, with a view to the life to
come, or, in other words, with a
view to the true and eternal, as distinguished
from the false and fleeting,
happiness of his creatures.
From whence it would seem to result
that the true character of the
ecclesiastical song and its true application
will be that in which it
tends, in its own proper degree, to
become an auxiliary in the accomplishment
of this great end. Nor
is it a second or a third rate efficaciousness
that should be deemed
sufficient. For if Almighty God,
as many theologians seem with so
much justice to say, not from any
external necessity, but from his
own perfections, in virtue of which
he is a law to himself, freely
chooses only those means that are
<em>most</em> efficacious to the end he proposes,
so, in like manner, the Catholic
Church, filled as she is with
the outpouring of the divine Spirit,
and called to the imitation of the
divine perfections, cannot but in like
manner feel constrained to choose
that alone for her music which
tends, with the best and most certain
efficacy, to the attainment of
the end which God has designed in
the gift.</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks have, I
hope, now laid the foundation on
which the proposed inquiry may be
conducted. And I think I may be
allowed to say in the outset that
an inquiry which has for its object
to ascertain what that may be in
music and in the manner of its use
which answers best to the idea existing
in the mind of God, unless it
very much belie its pretensions and
profession, may justly claim respect;
and that the whole investigation
is thus at once raised beyond
the horizon of anything like
human partisanship, as well as the
sphere of those little irritabilities
with which discussions upon music
may so easily be disfigured. And
without at all presuming that the
views here advocated ought necessarily
to be adopted, the inquiry is
still not a valueless service rendered
to religion, if it succeed no further
than in impressing upon the minds
of those into whose way it may fall
the fundamental idea upon which
it is built, viz., that the mission of
sacred song in the Catholic Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
is to realize, not the <em>ideas</em> of men,
which may and do differ in each
individual, but the <em>idea</em> of the merciful
and good God, who gave it
for his own purposes of mercy and
benevolence.</p>

<p>And since the idea, as it subsists
in the mind of God, relative to the
use of song in the Catholic Church,
is made the sole keystone of the
whole inquiry, as well to guard an
avenue against possible misconceptions
as also the more clearly to
lay the basis of the discussion, it
will be necessary to state, at a
somewhat greater length, what the
divine idea of sacred song, in its
first broad outline, may be taken
to be.</p>

<p>Sacred song, it has been said, is
to be regarded as the musical associate
and auxiliary of the work of
Christian instruction and sanctification
in the church. It cannot be
anything or everything that is luscious
or pleasing in music; moreover,
it is an idea that goes beyond
the notion of mere tune or melody,
or even of the richest combination
of sound that art ever produced.
Sacred song, in the divine idea,
must be more than mere music.
For though it be true that tunes
and other works of art in music are
so far things by themselves as to
be capable of being written in notation,
and thus preserved, still it
seems impossible that mere tunes
and mere music should answer to
the divine idea of sacred song.</p>

<p>When music has ceased to be
mere sound; when it has been taken
up by the feelings and living intelligence
of the human heart and
mind; when these have wedded it
to themselves, have created in it a
dwelling-place and a home, and out
of it have formed for themselves a
second language and range of expression;
when the charm of melody
has become the organ of a living
soul and an energetic intelligence,
then there results the birth
of an element of the utmost power
for good or evil in the heart of
human society; and it is in this
power, Christianized and reduced
to subservience to the church, that
there may be seen the first outline
of the divine idea of sacred song.</p>

<p>This principle is thus stated by
Mgr. Parisis, Bishop of Langres:</p>

<p>“To preserve the true character
of the ecclesiastical chant it is necessary
to recall to mind the following
essential maxim:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘<em>Music</em> for <em>words</em>, and not <em>words</em> for <em>music</em>.’</p>

</div>

<p>This is not the principle of worldly
music, in which the words are
often nothing but the unperceived
and insignificant auxiliary of the
sound.</p>

<p>“In religion this cannot be, because
articulate language is the essential
basis of all outward worship,
especially public worship. This is
a certain truth of both reason and
tradition. It is a truth of reason;
for language, that marvellous faculty
which the Creator has given to
man alone, is exclusively capable
of finding an adequate expression
for a worship of spirit and truth.
It is also a truth of tradition; for
the Catholic divine Offices have
always been composed of words
either drawn from the Sacred Scriptures
or consecrated by tradition
and chosen by the church. It is
superfluous to press the demonstration
of a principle that has never
even been contested by any sect of
separatists and does not admit of
serious doubt” (<cite>Pastoral Instruction
on the Song of the Church</cite>, part
ii.)</p>

<p>The three great social convulsions
of France have given a remarkable
proof of the above-mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
power of song. Each called
into being, and was furthered in
its rise and progress, by a song,
<cite>La Marseillaise</cite>, <cite>La Parisienne</cite>, and
that whose well-known burden runs
thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“C’est le plus beau sort, le plus digne d’envie</div>
<div class="verse">Que de mourir pour la patrie.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Separate the words of these songs
from their melodies, and the result
would probably be the insignificance
of both. But unite them,
see them pass into the mouths and
hearts of convulsed multitudes, observe
men, under the delirium of
their influence, march up to the
cannon’s mouth and plunge themselves
headlong into eternity, and
we have an instance of what is
meant by saying that music, united
to intelligence, is an agent of nearly
unlimited power for good or evil
in human society.</p>

<p>This, then, is the sense in which
sacred song is to be viewed as contemplated
in the divine idea, viz.,
as the union of music with thought,
feeling, and intelligence; in the
words of the apostle (1 Cor.), <em>I will
sing with the spirit, and I will sing
with the understanding also</em>&mdash;not, of
course, as taking the understanding
out of its natural medium, language,
but as clothing this its natural expression
with a superadded charm,
and a charm too, as will be afterwards
seen, which has the gift of
absorbing and, to a certain extent,
of reproducing the idea annexed to
it. The church music which the
divine idea contemplates is that
vocal song which Christian truth, in
all its varied range, has appropriated,
has taken from the sphere of
music and wedded to herself, with
the view of using the song thus associated
to herself as the instrument
by which she may pass into
the mouths of men, and in this way
find a home in their hearts. Analytically,
then, in the sacred song
contemplated by the divine idea,
two separate elements are to be
acknowledged&mdash;song and truth&mdash;but
practically only one; for in practice
they are indissolubly linked together,
and constitute one moral
whole, as body and soul together
make up but one living being, to
which, even more than to the sacred
architecture of a church, the beautiful
sentiment of the Ritual may be
applied:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“O sorte nupta prospera,</div>
<div class="verse">Dotata Patris gloria,</div>
<div class="verse">Respersa sponsi gratia,</div>
<div class="verse">Regina formosissima,</div>
<div class="verse">Christo jugata principi.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse right"><cite>De Ded. Eccl.</cite></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Turning now, with this view of
sacred song, to inquire what the
Catholic Church possesses, after
1800 years of labor with the people
of every variety of race and climate,
in realization of the idea
above stated, her various rituals,
now for the most part withdrawn
to make way for the beautiful Ritual
of the Roman Church, present themselves
to view. These rituals and
their chant<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> have, we may be sure,
at least in their day, been in the
church the fulfilment, imperfect
indeed and inadequate, as all that
man does in this world necessarily
is, yet still the fulfilment of the
divine idea with respect to song.
More cannot be necessary in support
of this statement than the
fact of the innumerable churches
that have overspread Christendom,
and the innumerable companies of
saintly men whose lives were spent
in the choirs of these churches&mdash;not,
of course, to the exclusion of other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
duties and spheres of labor, yet
mainly spent in the choral celebration
of the offices of the Ritual
and in all that accessory labor of
musical study and tuition which the
organization of a choir and the
becoming celebration of the divine
Office imply. The divine idea, in
accordance with which sacred song
has a fixed and determinate end to
realize in the church, is the only
way to account for this vast phenomenon
in the history of Christendom.
Nothing but an idea in the
mind of God that sacred song is
the living adjunct of the living
truth, which the Catholic Church
was sent to teach, could have had
the power to call into being, not
alone the rituals themselves and
their song, but the innumerable
choirs of Christendom which have
been gathered together and governed
by a more than human wisdom
of organization for the purpose of
their celebration.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind, then, that sacred
song is the combination of music
with the words of inspired truth, I
propose, in the ensuing inquiry, to
draw a detailed comparison between
the Roman liturgy and its traditional
chant, on the one hand, and
the works of the modern art of
music, which constitute the <i lang="fr">corps
de musique</i>, if I may use the expression
now in use, adapted as they
are to parts of the liturgy, and in
their own way contributing to supply
the want that is felt for sacred
music; and this with the view to
ascertain, as far as may be, from
the result of the comparison, in
which of the two the divine idea
and intention is best answered and
fulfilled. The human mind will
not, and indeed ought not to, submit
to any mere human idea, but
ought willingly to accept the idea
of God; and hence nothing but
the divine idea, and this alone, is
or can be the key to the present
inquiry.</p>

<h4>II<br />
<span class="smaller">THE COMPARISON CARRIED INTO ITS
DETAILS.</span></h4>

<p>It has been already laid down
that sacred song is the union of
music to the words of inspired
truth, with the view of its thus becoming
an auxiliary in the work of
Christian instruction and sanctification.</p>

<p>Before passing on to the approaching
details let us stop for a
moment fairly to consider the result
of this principle as it affects the
comparison generally.</p>

<p>Here, on the one hand, we have
the <cite>Canto Fermo</cite>, with its vast variety
of music, embracing an equally
varied range in the stores of divine
revelation, inasmuch as it is the
counterpart in song of the entire
Ritual; on the other hand we have
the works of modern music, of
which I am speaking, embracing
scarcely more than a fraction of the
Ritual. With a vast numerical
rather than a real variety in point
of the one constitutive element of
sacred song&mdash;viz., music&mdash;they are
poverty itself as regards the other&mdash;viz.,
inspired truth&mdash;the <cite>Kyrie</cite>,
<cite>Gloria</cite>, <cite>Credo</cite>, <cite>Sanctus</cite>, and <cite>Agnus
Dei</cite>, from the Ordinary of the Mass,
and a small number of hymns, antiphons,
and scattered verses from
the Holy Scriptures, in the form of
motets, being literally the sum-total
of their possession in this element.</p>

<p>And now to carry the comparison
into its details. The divine idea
of sacred song could not have been
known to us without a revelation,
the very gift itself being, from its
nature, the companion of a revelation.
We are not, therefore, as has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
been remarked in the introduction,
thrown upon our own natural
powers of speculation either for our
general knowledge of the divine
idea itself or for gaining an insight
into its constituent details; indeed,
without revelation this would have
been altogether beyond our natural
capacities. But since God became
man and founded his own society,
the Catholic Church, and both
taught himself and placed inspired
teachers in it to succeed him, the
ideas of God as to questions that
concern the welfare of his church
have, through the Incarnation of
the Son, been brought to the level
of our capacities, and are to be
found in the Scripture and in
Christian theology, and are there to
be sought for as occasion may require.
Thus examined, then, by
the light of the Christian revelation,
the divine idea of sacred song will,
without urging that these are co-extensive
with it, admit of being
resolved into the ensuing points;
the truth of which will be proved
separately, as they come forward
successively in the course of the
comparison. They are as follows:</p>

<p>I. Authority: 1, ecclesiastical;
2, moral.</p>

<p>II. Claim to the completeness
and order of a system.</p>

<p>III. Moral fitness: 1, as a sacrificial
song; 2, as a song for the
offices of the church.</p>

<p>IV. Fitness for passing among the
people as a congregational song.</p>

<p>V. Moral influence in the formation
of character.</p>

<p>VI. The medium or vehicle for
divine truth passing among the
people.</p>

<p>VII. Medicinal virtue.</p>

<p>VIII. Capacities for durable popularity.</p>

<p>IX. Security against abuse.</p>

<p>X. Catholicity, or companionship
of the Catholic doctrines over the
globe.</p>

<p>Upon these, then, the comparison
may be now conducted.</p>

<h3>NEW PUBLICATIONS.</h3>

<div class="hanging">

<p><span class="smcap">The Internal Mission of the Holy
Ghost.</span> By Henry Edward, Cardinal
Archbishop of Westminster. New
York: The Catholic Publication Society.
1875.</p>

</div>

<p>Those who have read the most eminent
prelate’s <cite>Temporal Mission of the Holy
Ghost</cite> will know what a spiritual and intellectual
feast is before them in the present
work, “which traces,” says the
author, in his dedicatory preface to the
Oblates of S. Charles, “at least the outline
of the same subject.”</p>

<p>“The former book,” he explains, “was
on the special office of the Holy Ghost in
the one visible church, which is the organ
of his divine voice. The present volume
deals with the universal office of the Holy
Ghost in the souls of men. The former
or special office dates from the Incarnation
and the day of Pentecost; the latter
or universal office dates from the Creation,
and at this hour still pervades by its operations
the whole race of mankind. It is
true to say with S. Irenæus, ‘Ubi Ecclesia,
ibi Spiritus&mdash;Where the church is,
there is the Spirit’; but it would not be
true to say, Where the church is not,
neither is the Spirit there. The operations
of the Holy Ghost have always pervaded
the whole race of men from the beginning,
and they are now in full activity
even among those who are without the
church; for God ‘will have all men to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
saved and to come to the knowledge of
the truth.’”</p>

<p>“I have, therefore,” he continues, “in
this present volume, spoken of the universal
office of which every living man
has shared and does share at this hour;
and I have tried to draw the outline of
our individual sanctification.”</p>

<p>And then, after expressing a hope that
the Oblate Fathers may be “stirred up to
edit in one volume” certain great treatises,
patristic and scholastic, on the Holy
Ghost and his gifts, as “a precious store
for students and for preachers”&mdash;a wish in
which we most heartily concur&mdash;he goes
on to say:</p>

<p>“My belief is that these topics have a
special fitness in the XIXth century.
They are the direct antidote both of the
heretical spirit which is abroad and of the
unspiritual and worldly mind of so many
Christians. The presence of the Holy
Ghost in the church is the source of its
infallibility; the presence of the Holy
Ghost in the soul is the source of its sanctification.
These two operations of the
same Spirit are in perfect harmony. The
test of the spiritual man is his conformity
to the mind of the church. <cite>Sentire cum
Ecclesia</cite>, in dogma, discipline, traditions,
devotions, customs, opinions, sympathies,
is the countersign that the work in our
hearts is not from the diabolical spirit
nor from the human, but from the divine.”</p>

<p>And again:</p>

<p>“It would seem to me that the development
of error has constrained the
church in these times to treat especially
of the third and last clause of the Apostles’
Creed: ‘I believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church, the Communion
of Saints.’ The definitions of the Immaculate
Conception of the Mother of
God, of the Infallibility of the Vicar of
Christ, bring out into distinct relief the
twofold office of the Holy Ghost, of which
one part is his perpetual assistance in the
church; the other, his sanctification of
the soul, of which the Immaculate Conception
is the first-fruits and the perfect
examplar.</p>

<p>“The living consciousness which the
Catholic Church has that it is the dwelling
place of the Spirit of Truth and the
organ of his voice seems to be still growing
more and more vividly upon its pastors
and people as the nations are falling
away.”</p>

<p>The work consists of seventeen chapters.
The first two are headed respectively
“Grace the Work of a Person,”
and “Salvation by Grace.” Then follow
three on the virtues of faith, hope, and
charity. The sixth treats of “The Glory of
Sons.” From the seventh to the fourteenth
we have the “Seven Gifts of the Holy
Ghost.” The fifteenth is on “The Fruits
of the Spirit”; the sixteenth on “The
Beatitudes.” The last chapter deals
with “Devotion to the Holy Ghost.” We
must refrain from making citations from
these chapters; for if we once began,
we should find it very difficult to stop.
But we would draw special attention to
the ninth chapter, on the “Gift of Piety,”
and again to the seventeenth, on “Devotion
to the Holy Ghost.” This devotion
is one we have very much at heart;
for none, we are persuaded, can so help
us to realize the presence of God with
and in us, and also the intimacy and
tenderness of his love. We believe, with
the Ven. Grignon de Montfort, that devotion
to the Holy Ghost is to have a special
growth, in union with devotion to his
spouse, Our Lady, in these last times of
the church.</p>

<p>We commend, then, this beautiful book
to our readers as one of the most valuable
and at the same time delightful it can
ever be their lot to study. The happy
language and luminous style of the author
make his works intelligible to the ordinary
mind beyond those of most theological
writers. We trust that every encouragement
will be given to the circulation
of this work in America.</p>

<p>We have but to add that this is the only
authorized American edition of the work,
having been printed from duplicate sets
of the stereotype plates of the London
publishers.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to say aught in
praise of so old and well-established a

that the above is identical with the new
and handsome London edition containing
the corrections and additions of the

in 1847, has been some time out of print,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
and the English market was supplied
from this country until the American
plates were consumed in the Boston
fire.</p>

<p>This is not like the common run of
stories; the story is only a slender thread,
on which the garland of flowers culled
by the pious and gifted author in honor
of the Most Holy Virgin Mary is strung.
The style is subdued, poetic, and devout,
and there is just enough of dramatic personality
and incident to relieve the mind
and interest the imagination, while the
reader follows the current of thought and
reflection and pious sentiment which
chiefly demands his attention.</p>

<p>We are now authorized to state that
this work, which has heretofore appeared
anonymously, was written by Edward
Healy Thompson, A.M., so favorably

etc., published under his editorial and

<p><span class="smcap">The Life of Father Bernard.</span> By
Canon Claessens, of the Cathedral of
Malines. Translated from the French.
New York: The Catholic Publication
Society. 1875.</p>

</div>

<p>The many persons who remember the
celebrated Father Bernard, Provincial of
the Redemptorists in the United States,
and director of a great many of the missions
given by his subjects from the year
1851, will be pleased to read this biography.
Father Bernard was a man of
remarkable gifts and very thorough, solid
learning, but still more eminent for apostolic
zeal and personal sanctity. The late
Archbishop Hughes had a very great veneration
for him, and said of him, in his
terse, emphatic style, which had more
weight as he very seldom employed it in
the praise of men: “Father Bernard is a
man of God.” Besides the labors of a
long life, he devoted a large fortune
which he inherited to the service of religion.
He was more celebrated in the
Low Countries, as a preacher in the
French and Flemish languages, than in
the United States and Ireland, where he
was obliged to make use of German and
English. The biography is very interesting,
and gives a full account of the earlier
and later periods of Father Bernard’s life
and his holy death, which occurred at Wittem,
September 2, 1865, at the age of 58.
The history of his administration of the
province of the United States is meagre, although
this was the most distinguished
and useful portion of his public career.
The appendix contains an amusing letter
describing the voyage of Father Bernard
and a band of Redemptorists from Liverpool
to New York. Father Hecker and
Father Walworth came back on this occasion;
and immediately afterwards, during
the Lent of 1851, the mission of S.
Joseph’s, New York, was given, which is
famous and remembered even now.
Father Bernard’s American friends will
be specially interested in the history of
the closing scenes of his life. His death
was like that of the saints; and we may
say without exaggeration that he was in
every way one of the worthiest of the sons
of his great father, S. Alphonsus, who
have adorned the annals of the Congregation
he founded. The portrait at the
head of the volume, though not admirable
as a work of art, is strikingly faithful to
the original.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Story of a Convert.</span> By B. W.
Whitcher, A.M. New York: P. O’Shea.
1875.</p>

</div>

<p>Those who have read the <cite>Widow Bedott
Papers</cite> have not forgotten that humorous
and extremely satirical production.
The authorship of this clever <i lang="fr">jeu
d’esprit</i> was in common between Mr.
Whitcher and his former wife, a lady
who died many years ago. Something
of the piquant flavor of that early work is
to be found in <cite>The Story of a Convert</cite>.
It is, however, in the main, serious, argumentative,
and remarkably plain and
straightforward. Mr. Whitcher was an
Episcopalian minister. He became a
Catholic from reading, conviction, and the
grace of God, which, unlike many others,
he obeyed at a great sacrifice. He has,
since that time, lived a laborious, self-denying,
humble life as a Catholic layman;
and his arguments have therefore
the weight of his good example to increase
their force. The fidelity to conscience
of such men is a severe reproach
to the <i lang="it">dilettanti</i> and amateur theologians
who dabble for amusement in pseudo-Catholicism,
and are ready to sacrifice
their consciences and to mislead others
to their eternal perdition for the sake of
worldly advantages. This little book is
one well worthy of circulation, and likely
to do a great deal of good. We notice
that the author mentions the name of
McVickar among the converts from the
General Theological Seminary. We have
never heard of any convert of that name
who was ever a student at this seminary,
and we think Mr. Whitcher’s memory
must have deceived him in this instance.
We trust that this excellent little
book will find an extensive sale and the
honesty of the author at least a few imitators.</p>

chest, which was bequeathed by the last
of the family to a friend, who published
its contents. It is not so good in execution
as in conception; for, indeed, it would require
the hand of a master to carry out
such an idea successfully. Nevertheless it
is quite interesting and instructive reading.</p>

<p>We do not ordinarily feel called upon

but as the work was not issued by a
Catholic house, it may have escaped the
attention of many of our readers who
would be glad to make its acquaintance.
We perceive that the original work was
submitted to the approval of one of the
Benedictine theologians at Solesmes, and
that Canon Torre Velez has, in an appreciative
introduction, discussed the plan

<h3>THE IRISH WORLD.</h3>

<p>It is not customary nor ordinarily proper
for a magazine to engage in controversies
which are waged among newspapers.
Nevertheless, the one in which
the <cite>Irish World</cite> is engaging itself with a
considerable number of our Catholic
newspapers is of such unusual importance
and violence that we trust we may
be permitted to make a few remarks upon
it. Disunion, division of sentiment
founded on differences of nationality and
race, extreme partisan contests on any
pretext whatever, and violent hostilities,
among those who profess the Catholic religion,
especially just at this time and in
this country, are to be deprecated as more
injurious to the cause of the faith and
church of God than any amount of opposition
from professed enemies of the
Catholic religion. These can only be
avoided by adopting and following out
pure and perfect Catholic principles In
all things whatsoever, and making the
Catholic rule of submission to lawful
authority, and conformity to the Catholic
tradition, the Catholic spirit, and the
common-sense which pervades the whole
body of sound, loyal, hearty Catholics
everywhere, without any exception or
reservation, the standard of judgment
and the law of action. It is necessary to be
first a Catholic and afterwards French,
German, American, English, or Irish, as
the case may be; to be first of all sure that
we understand and receive the teaching
and the spirit of the Catholic Church, in
theology, philosophy, morals, politics, and
that we make her rights and interests,
her advancement and glory, the spiritual
and eternal good of the whole human
race, the triumph of Jesus Christ, and the
glory of God, paramount to everything.
Secondary interests, and ideas, opinions,
projects, which spring merely from private
conviction or characterize nationalities,
schools, parties, associations of human
origin, should always be subordinate
and be kept under the control of
the higher principles of Catholic unity,
charity, and enlightened regard for the
rights of all men. This is the only true
liberality. Liberalism, as it is called,
which is nothing else than the detestable,
anti-Christian Revolution, destroys all
this by subverting the principle of order,
which alone secures harmony, a just
equality, and the rights of all. What is
called Catholic liberalism, and has been
denounced by Pius IX. as more dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
and mischievous among Catholics
than any open heresy could be, is a system
of independence of Catholic authority,
and of separation from the Catholic
common doctrine and sentiment, of disrespect,
disloyalty, irreverence, disobedience,
and opposition to the hierarchy
and the Holy See, in those things which
are not categorically defined as articles
of faith, yet, nevertheless, are doctrinally
or practically determined by authority.</p>

<p>We have not been in much danger in
this country from any clique of ecclesiastical
and theological liberals. But the
line adopted by the <cite>Irish World</cite> shows
an imminent danger from another quarter.
The editor professes submission to
the authority of the Catholic Church in
respect to the faith, and those precepts of
religion and morals which are essential.
We give him credit for sincerity and honesty
and for good intentions. These
are not, however, sufficient guarantees
against principles and opinions which
are erroneous, logically incompatible
with doctrines of faith, tending to subvert
faith in the minds of his readers,
and producing an irreverent and disloyal
spirit contrary to the true Christian
and Catholic submission and respect to
the prelates and the priesthood which is
commanded by the law of God. If the
respected gentleman who edits the
<cite>Irish World</cite> desires to employ his talents
and zeal to a really noble and
useful purpose, with success and honor,
for the spiritual and temporal welfare
of men of his own race and religion,
we recommend to him, in a friendly
spirit, to modify some of his ideas in a
more Catholic sense, and to take counsel
from those who understand thoroughly the
doctrine and spirit of the Catholic Church.
Much greater men than any of us&mdash;Jansenius,
De Lamennais, Döllinger, and a
host of others&mdash;began by professing to be
Catholics in <em>faith</em>. But they preferred
their own private notions in respect to
certain reforms in doctrine, discipline or
morals, and politics, which they considered
to be necessary and important, to the
judgment of their spiritual rulers and the
common Catholic sense. Their end was
in heresy or apostasy, and they misled to
their ruin those who followed them. We
trust we shall be spared the misfortune
of seeing a falling away from the faith
of any part of the Catholic race of Ireland,
either at home or in other countries.
They are in no danger of perversion to
Protestantism, nor are they at present assailable
by open and avowed enemies of
religion. It is by hidden poison only
that they can be gradually infected and
destroyed. This poison must disguise
itself in some way as Liberal Catholicism.
This is precisely the lurking poison
which the unerring Catholic instinct
has detected in the specious, pseudo-Christian,
pseudo-Scriptural, pseudo-Catholic,
and pseudo-Irish communism into which
the conductors of the <cite>Irish World</cite> have
been unwittingly betrayed. A journal so
extensively circulated must necessarily,
unless purged from this foreign and noxious
element, do a great deal of harm. If
the good sense, honesty, and Catholic
faith of its editors are strong enough to
free them from the specious illusions of
Liberalism, the <cite>Irish World</cite> is in a condition
to exert a very great and extensive
influence for good, and we shall heartily
wish it success. We approve of the free
and generous activity of laymen in associations
and through the press. Nevertheless,
the great liberty enjoyed by them
is liable to misdirection, and it is very
necessary to guard against disorders
which may spring from its abuse.</p>

<h3>SPACE.<br />
<span class="smaller">I.</span></h3>

<p>Mathematicians admit three
kinds of continuous quantities, viz.,
the quantity of space measured by
local movement, the quantity of
time employed in the movement,
and the quantity of change in the
intensity of the movement. Thus
all continuity, according to them,
depends on movement; so that, if
there were no continuous movement,
nothing could be conceived
as continuous. The ancient philosophers
generally admitted, and
many still admit, a fourth kind of
continuous quantity, viz., the quantity
of matter; but it is now fully
demonstrated that bodies of matter
are not, and cannot be, materially
continuous, even in their primitive
molecules, and that therefore the
quantity of matter is not continuous,
but consists of a discrete number
of primitive material units. Hence,
matter is not divisible <i lang="la">in infinitum</i>,
and gives no occasion to infinitesimal
quantities, except inasmuch as
the volumes, or quantities of space,
occupied (not filled) by matter are
conceived to keep within infinitesimal
dimensions. We may, therefore,
be satisfied that space, time,
and movement alone are continuous
and infinitely divisible, and that the
continuity of space and time, as
viewed by the mathematicians, is
essentially connected with the continuity
of movement. But space
measured by movement is a <em>relative</em>
space, and time&mdash;that is, the duration
of movement&mdash;is a <em>relative</em> duration;
and since everything relative
presupposes something absolute
which is the source of its relativity,
we are naturally brought to inquire
what is <em>absolute</em> space and <em>absolute</em>
duration; for, without the knowledge
of the absolute, the relative
can be only imperfectly understood.
Men of course daily speak of time
and of space, and understand what
they say, and are understood by
others; but this does not show that
they know the intimate nature, or
can give the essential definition, of
either time or space. S. Augustine
asks: “What is time?” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
he answers: “When no one asks
me, I know what it is; but when
you ask me, I know not.” The
same is true of space. We know
what it is; but it would be hard to
give its true definition. As, however,
a true notion of space and
time and movement cannot but be
of great service in the elucidation
of some important questions of philosophy,
we will venture to investigate
the subject, in the hope that
by so doing we may contribute in
some manner to the development
of philosophical knowledge concerning
the nature of those mysterious
realities which form the conditions
of the existence and vicissitudes
of the material world.</p>

<p><i>Opinions of Philosophers about
Space.</i>&mdash;Space is usually defined “a
capacity of bodies,” and is styled
“full” when a body actually occupies
that capacity, “void,” or
“empty,” when no body is actually
present in it. Again, a space which
is determined by the presence of a
body, and limited by its limits, is
called “real,” whilst the space
which is conceived to extend beyond
the limits of all existing bodies
is called “imaginary.”</p>

<p>Whether this definition and division
of space is as correct as it is
common, we shall examine hereafter.
Meanwhile, we must notice that
there is a great disagreement among
philosophers in regard to the reality
and the essence of space. Some
hold, with Descartes and with Leibnitz,
that space is nothing else than
the extension of bodies. Others
hold that space is something real,
and really distinct from the bodies
by which it is occupied. Some, as
Clarke, said that space is nothing
but God’s immensity, and considered
the parts of space as parts of
divine immensity. Fénelon taught
that space is virtually contained in
God’s immensity, and that immensity
is nothing but unlimited extension&mdash;which
last proposition is much
criticised by Balmes<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> on the ground
that extension cannot be conceived
without parts, whereas no parts can
be conceived in God’s immensity.</p>

<p>Lessius, in his much-esteemed
work on God’s perfections, after
having shown (contrary to the opinion
of some of his contemporaries)
that God by his immensity exists
not only within but also without
the world, puts to himself the following
objection: “Some will say,
How can God be in those spaces
outside the skies, since no spaces
are to be found there which are not
fictitious and imaginary?” To which
he answers thus: “We deny that
there are not outside of the whole
world any true intervals or spaces.
If air or light were diffused throughout
immensity outside of the existing
world, there would certainly be
true spaces everywhere; and in
the same manner, if there is a Spirit
filling everything outside of this
world, there will be true and real
spaces, not corporeal but spiritual,
which, however, will not be really
distinct from one another, because
a Spirit does not extend through
space by a distribution of parts, but
fills it, so to say, by its totalities.…
Hence, when we say that God is
outside of the existing world, and
filling infinite spaces, or that God
exists in imaginary spaces, we do
not mean that God exists in a
fictitious and chimerical thing,
nor do we mean that he exists
in a space really distinct from
his own being; but we mean that
he exists in the space which his
immensity formally extends, and to
which an infinite created space may
correspond.… We may therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
distinguish space into <em>created</em>,
<em>uncreated</em>, and <em>imaginary</em>. Created
space embraces the whole corporeal
extension of the material world.
Uncreated space is nothing less
than divine immensity itself, which
is the primitive, intrinsic, and fundamental
space, on the existence of
which all other spaces depend, and
which by reason of its extension is
equivalent to all possible corporeal
spaces, and eminently contains
them all. Imaginary space is that
which our imagination suggests to
us as a substitute for God’s immensity,
which we are unable to conceive
in any other wise. For, just
as we cannot conceive God’s eternity
without imagining infinite time,
so neither can we conceive God’s
immensity without imagining infinite
space.”<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Boscovich, in his <cite>Theory of Natural
Philosophy</cite>, defines space as “an
infinite possibility of ubications,”
but he does not say anything in regard
to the manner of accounting
for such a possibility. Others, as
Charleton, were of opinion that
real space is constituted by the
real ubication of material things,
and imaginary space by the actual
negation of real ubications.</p>

<p>Among the modern authors,
Balmes, with whom a number of
other philosophers agree on this
subject, gives us his theory of space
in the following propositions:</p>

<p>“1st. Space is nothing but the
extension of bodies themselves.</p>

<p>“2d. Space and extension are
identical notions.</p>

<p>“3d. The parts which we conceive
in space are particular extensions,
considered as existing under
their own limits.</p>

<p>“4th. The notion of infinite
space is the notion of extension in
all its generality&mdash;that is, as conceived
by the abstraction of all
limits.</p>

<p>“5th. Indefinite space is a figment
of our imagination, which
strives to follow the intellectual
process of generalization by destroying
all limits.</p>

<p>“6th. Where no body exists,
there is no space.</p>

<p>“7th. Distance is the interposition
of a body, and nothing more.</p>

<p>“8th. If the body interposed
vanishes, all distance vanishes, and
contiguity, or absolute contact, will
be the result.</p>

<p>“9th. If there were two bodies
only, they would not be distant;
at least, we could not intellectually
conceive them as distant.</p>

<p>“10th. A vacuum, whether of a
large or of a small extent, whether
accumulated or scattered, is an absolute
impossibility.”<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>These assertions form the substance
of Balmes’ theory of space.
But he wisely adds: “The apparent
absurdity of some of these conclusions,
and of others which I
shall mention hereafter, leads me
to believe either that the principle
on which my reasonings rest is not
altogether free from error, or that
there is some latent blunder in the
process of the deduction.”<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Lastly, to omit other suppositions
which do not much differ from the
ones we have mentioned, Kant and
his followers are of opinion that
space is nothing but a subjective
form of our mind, and an intuition
<i lang="la">a priori</i>. Hence, according to
them, no real and objective space
can be admitted.</p>

<p>Amid this variety and discord
of opinions, we can hardly hope to
ascertain the truth, and satisfy ourselves
of its reality, unless we settle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
a few preliminary questions. It is
necessary for us to know, first,
whether any vacuum is or is not to
be admitted in nature; then, we
must know whether such a vacuum
is or is not an objective reality.
For, if it can be established that
vacuum is mere nothingness, the
consequence will be that all real
space is necessarily and essentially
filled with matter, as Balmes and
others teach; if, on the contrary,
it can be established that vacuum
exists in nature, and has an objective
reality, then it will follow that
the reality of space does not arise
from the presence of bodies, and
cannot be confounded with their
extension. In this case, Balmes’
theory will fall to the ground, and
we shall have to borrow from Lessius
and Fénelon, if not the whole
solution of the question, at least the
main conceptions on which it rests.</p>

<p><i>Existence of Void Space.</i>&mdash;The
first thing we must ascertain is the
existence or non-existence of vacuum
in nature. <em>Is there any space
in the world not occupied by matter?</em></p>

<p>Our answer must be affirmative,
for many reasons. First, because
without vacuum local movement
would be impossible. In fact, since
matter does not compenetrate matter,
no movement can take place in
a space full of matter unless the
matter which lies on the way gives
room to the advancing body. But
such a matter cannot give room
without moving; and it cannot
move unless some other portion of
matter near it vacates its place to
make room for it. This other portion
of matter, however, cannot
make room without moving; and it
cannot move unless another portion
of matter makes room for it; and
so on without end, or at least till
we reach the outward limits of the
material world. Hence, if there is
no vacuum, a body cannot begin to
move before it has shaken the
whole material world throughout
and compelled it to make room for
its movement. Now, to make the
movement of a body dependent on
such a condition is absurd; for the
condition can never be fulfilled.
In fact, whilst the movement of the
body cannot begin before room is
made for it, no room is made for it
before the movement has begun;
for it is by moving that the body
would compel the neighboring matter
to give way. The condition is
therefore contradictory, and can
never be fulfilled, and therefore, if
there is no vacuum, no local movement
is possible.</p>

<p>Secondly, it has been proved in
one of our articles on matter<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> that
there is no such thing in the world
as material continuity, and that
therefore all natural bodies ultimately
consist of simple and unextended
elements. It is therefore
necessary to admit that bodies
owe their extension to the intervals
of space intercepted between their
primitive elements, and therefore
there is a vacuum between all the
material elements. This reason is
very plain and cannot be questioned,
as the impossibility of continuous
matter has been established
by such evident arguments as defy
cavil.</p>

<p>Thirdly, bodies are compressible,
and, when compressed, occupy
less space&mdash;that is, their matter or
mass is reduced to a less volume.
Now, such a reduction in the volume
of a body does not arise from
material compenetration. It must
therefore depend on a diminution
of the distances, or void intervals,
between the neighboring particles
of matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>Fourthly, it is well known that
equal masses can exist under unequal
volumes, and <i lang="la">vice versa</i>&mdash;that
is, equal quantities of matter may
occupy unequal spaces, and unequal
quantities of matter may occupy
equal spaces. This shows
that one and the same space can be
more or less occupied, according as
the density of the body is greater
or less. But the same space cannot
be more or less occupied if
there is no vacuum. For, if there
is no vacuum, the space is <em>entirely</em>
occupied by the matter, and does
not admit of different degrees of
occupation. It is therefore evident
that without vacuum it is impossible
to account for the specific
weights and unequal densities of
bodies.</p>

<p>Against this, some may object
that what we call “vacuum” may
be full of imponderable matter,
say, of ether, the presence of which
cannot indeed be detected by the
balance, but is well proved by the
phenomena of heat, electricity, etc.
To which we answer, that the presence
of ether between the molecules
of bodies does not exclude
vacuum; for ether itself is subject
to condensation and rarefaction, as
is manifest by its undulatory movements;
and no condensation or
rarefaction is possible without
vacuum, as we have already explained.</p>

<p>Another objection against our
conclusion may be the following:
Simple elements, if they be attractive,
can penetrate through one another,
as we infer from the Newtonian
law of action. Hence, the
possibility of movement does not
depend on the existence of vacuum.
We answer, that the objection destroys
itself; for whoever admits
simple and unextended elements,
must admit the existence of vacuum,
it being evident that no space can
be filled by unextended matter.
We may add, that natural bodies
and their molecules do not exclusively
consist of attractive elements,
but contain a great number of repulsive
elements, to which they owe
their impenetrability.</p>

<p>The ancients made against the
existence of a vacuum another objection,
drawn from the presumed
necessity of a true material contact
for the communication of movement.
Vacuum, they said, is <i lang="la">contra
bonum naturæ</i>&mdash;that is, incompatible
with the requirements of natural
order, for it prevents the interaction
of bodies. This objection
need hardly be answered, as it has
long since been disposed of by the
discovery of universal gravitation
and of other physical truths. As
we have proved in another place
that “distance is an essential condition
of the action of matter upon
matter,”<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> we shall say nothing
more on this point.</p>

<p><i>Objective Reality of Vacuum.</i>&mdash;The
second thing we must ascertain is
<em>whether space void of matter be a
mere nothing, or an objective reality</em>.
Though Balmes and most modern
philosophers hold that vacuum is
mere nothingness, we think with
other writers that the contrary can
be rigorously demonstrated. Here
are our reasons.</p>

<p>First, nothingness is not a region
of movement. But vacuum is a region
of movement. Therefore, vacuum
is not mere nothingness.
The minor of this syllogism is
manifest from what we have just
said about the impossibility of
movement without vacuum, and
the major can be easily proved.
For, the interval of space which is
measured by movement may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
greater or less, whilst it would be
absurd to talk of a greater or a less
nothing; which shows that vacuum
cannot be identified with nothingness.
Again, void space can
be really occupied, whilst it would
be absurd to say that nothingness
is really occupied, for occupation
implies the presence of that which
occupies in that which is occupied;
hence, the occupation of nothingness
would be the presence of a
thing to nothing. But presence to
nothing is no presence at all, just
as relation to nothing is no relation.
And therefore, the occupation of
void space, if vacuum were a mere
nothing, would be an evident contradiction.
Moreover, nothingness
has no real attributes, whereas real
attributes are predicated of void
space. We find no difficulty in
conceiving void space as infinite,
immovable, and virtually extended
in all directions; whilst the conception
of an extended nothing and
of an infinite nothing is an utter
impossibility. Whence we conclude
that space void of matter is not a
mere nothing.</p>

<p>Secondly, a mere nothing cannot
be the foundation of a real relation:
space void of matter is the foundation
of a real relation; therefore,
space void of matter is not a mere
nothing. In this syllogism the
major is quite certain; for all real
relation has a real foundation, from
which the correlated terms receive
their relativity. Now, all real foundation
is something real. On the
other hand, nothingness is nothing
real. Therefore, a mere nothing
cannot be the foundation of a real
relation. The minor proposition
is no less certain, because space
founds the relation of distance
between any two material points,
which relation is certainly real. In
fact, that on account of which a
distant term is related to another
distant term, is the possibility of
movement from the one to the
other&mdash;that is, the possibility of a
series of successive ubications between
the two terms, without which
no distance is conceivable. But
the possibility of successive ubications
is nothing else than the successive
occupability of space, or
space as occupable. And therefore,
occupable space, or space void of
matter, is the foundation of a real
relation, and accordingly is an objective
reality.</p>

<p>Thirdly, if vacuum were mere
nothingness, no real extension
could be conceived as possible.
For, since all bodies are ultimately
composed of elements destitute of
extension, as has been demonstrated
at length in our articles on matter,
and since the primitive elements
cannot touch one another
mathematically without compenetration,
the extension of bodies
cannot be accounted for except by
the existence of void intervals of
space between neighboring elements.
But, if vacuum is a mere
nothing, all void intervals of space
are nothing, and nothing remains
between the neighboring elements;
and if nothing remains between
them, all the elements must be in
mathematical contact, and therefore
unite in a single indivisible point,
as even Balmes concedes. Whence
it is evident that the existence of
real extension implies the objective
reality of vacuum. We conclude,
therefore, that space void of matter
is not a mere nothing, but an objective
reality.</p>

<p>Against this proposition some objections
are made by the upholders
of a different doctrine. In the first
place, distance, they say, is a mere
negation of contact; and since a
mere negation is nothing, there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
no need of assuming that vacuum
is a reality.</p>

<p>We answer, that, if distance were
a mere negation of contact, there
would be no different distances; for
the negation of contact does not
admit of degrees, and cannot be
greater or less. Distances may be,
and are, greater or less. Therefore,
distance is not a mere negation of
contact. The negation of contact
shows that the terms of the relation
are distinct in space; for distinction
in space is the negation of a common
ubication. But the distinction
of the terms, though a necessary
condition for the existence of the
relation, does not constitute it.
Hence, the relation of distance presupposes,
indeed, the distinction of
the terms and the negation of contact,
but formally it results from a
positive foundation by which the
terms are linked together in this or
that determinate manner. If the
interval between two material
points were nothing, a greater interval
would be a greater nothing,
and a less interval a less nothing.
We presume that no philosopher
can safely admit a doctrine which
leads to such a conclusion.</p>

<p>A second objection is as follows:
It is possible to have distance without
any vacuum between the distant
terms. For, if the whole
space between those terms were
full of matter, their distance would
be all the more real, without implying
the reality of vacuum.</p>

<p>We answer, first, that, to fill
space, continuous matter would be
needed; and, as continuous matter
has no existence in nature, no space
can be filled with matter so as to
exclude real vacuum. We answer,
secondly, that, were it possible to
admit continuous matter, filling the
whole interval of space between
two distant terms, the reality of
that interval would still remain independent
of the matter by which
it is assumed to be filled; for matter
is not space; and, on the other
hand, if all the matter which is
supposed to fill the interval be removed,
the distance between the
terms will not vanish; which shows
that the filling of space, even if it
were not an impossible task, would
not in the least contribute to the
constitution of real distances.
Hence, space, even if it were assumed
to be full of matter, would
not found the relation of distance
by its fulness, but only by its being
terminated to distinct terms, so as
to leave room between them for a
certain extension of local movement.</p>

<p>A third objection may be the following:
True though it is that
real attributes are predicated of
void space, it does not follow that
void space is an objective reality.
For, when we say that space, as
such, is infinite, immovable, etc.,
we must bear in mind that we
speak of a potential nature, and
that those predicates are only potential.
Again, though we must
admit that void space can be measured
by movement, we know that
such a mensuration is not made by
terms of space, but by terms of
matter. Lastly, although space is
the capacity of receiving bodies, it
does not follow that there is in
space any receptive reality; for its
capacity is sufficiently accounted
for by admitting that space becomes
real by its very occupation.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>To the first point of this objection
we answer, that space may, perhaps,
be called a “potential nature” in
this sense, that it is susceptible of
new extrinsic denominations; but
if by “potential nature” the objector<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
means to express a potency of
being, and to convey the idea that
such a nature is not real, then it is
absolutely wrong to say that void
space is a potential nature. Space
is not in a state of possibility, and
never has been, as we shall presently
show. Hence the predicates,
<em>infinite</em>, <em>immovable</em>, etc., by which
the nature of space is explained,
express the actual attributes of an
actual reality. The author from
whom we have transcribed this objection
says that such predicates of
space are real, not <em>objectively</em>, but
only <em>subjectively</em>. He means, if we
understand him aright, that the reality
of such predicates must be traced
to the bodies which occupy space,
not to space itself, and that, though
we conceive those predicates to be
real owing to the real bodies we see
in space, yet they are not real in
space itself. As for us, we cannot
understand how “to be <em>infinite</em>, to
be <em>immovable</em>, to be <em>occupable</em>, etc.,”
can be the property of any body
which occupies space, or be the
property of space, by reason of its
occupation and not by reason of
its own intrinsic nature. Space
must be really occupable before it
is really occupied; and nothing is
really occupable which is not real,
as we have already established.
Whence we conclude that this part
of the objection, as confounding
the possibility of occupation with
the possibility of being, has no
weight.</p>

<p>To the second point we answer,
that the thing mensurable should
not be confounded with that by
which it can be measured. Whatever
may be the nature of the
measure to be employed in measuring,
no mensuration is possible unless
the mensurable is really mensurable.
Hence, no matter by
what measure space is to be measured,
it is always necessary to concede
that, if it is really measured,
it is something real. The assertion
that space is measured “by terms
of matter” can scarcely have a
meaning. Terms, in fact, measure
nothing, but are merely the beginning
and the end of the thing
measured. Space is measured by
continuous movement, not by terms
of matter; but before it is thus
measured, it is mensurable; and its
mensurability sufficiently shows its
objective reality.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>To the third point of the objection
we reply, that space is not a
<em>subject</em> destined to receive bodies;
and therefore it is not to be called
“a capacity of <em>receiving</em> bodies.”
Hence, we admit that space has no
“receptive” reality. But there are
realities which are not receptive,
because they are not intrinsically
potential; and such is the reality
of space, as we shall hereafter explain.
With regard to the assertion
that “space becomes real by its
very occupation,” we observe that,
if space void of matter is nothing,
as the objection assumes, it is utterly
impossible that it become a
reality by the presence of bodies in
it. The presence of a body in
space is a real relation of the body
to the space occupied; and such a relation
presupposes two real terms&mdash;that
is, a real body and a real space.
If space, as such, is nothing, bodies
were created in nothing, and occupy
nothing. Their volumes will
be nothings of different sizes, their
dimensions nothings of different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
lengths, and their movements the
measurement of nothing. It is
manifest that real occupation presupposes
real occupability, and real
mensuration real mensurability;
and, since mensurability implies
quantity (<em>virtual</em> quantity, at least),
to say that occupable and mensurable
space is nothing, is to pretend
that nothingness implies quantity&mdash;a
thing which we, at least, cannot
understand. Moreover, to consider
void space as a potency of being,
destined to become a reality
through the presence of bodies, is
no less a blunder than to admit that
the absolute is nothing until it becomes
relative, or to admit the
relative without the absolute. In
fact, the space occupied by a body
is a relative space, as its determination
depends on the relative dimensions
of the body. On the other
hand, the relative dimensions of the
body are themselves dependent on
space, for without space there are
no dimensions; and the space on
which such relative dimensions depend
must be a reality in itself, independently
of the same dimensions,
it being evident that the dimensions
of the body cannot bestow
reality upon that which is the
source of their own reality. To
say the contrary is to destroy the
principle of causality, by making
the absolute reality of the cause
dependent on the reality of its effects.
The assertion that “the absolute
is nothing until it becomes
relative,” leads straight to Pantheism.
If you say that absolute
space is nothing until it is occupied
by bodies, and thus actuated and
exhibited under determinate figures,
the Pantheist will say, with as
much reason, that the absolute
being is nothing until it is evolved
in nature, and thus actuated and
manifested under different aspects.
If you say that absolute space, as
such, is but an imaginary conception,
he will draw the inference that
absolute being, as such, is similarly
a mere figment of our brains.
If you say that the only reality of
space arises from its figuration and
occupation, he will claim the right
of concluding, in like manner, that
the only reality of the absolute
arises from its evolution and manifestation.
We might dilate a great
deal more on this parallel; for
everything that the deniers of
the reality of void space can
say in support of their view
can be turned to account by the
deniers of a personal God, and
be made to serve the cause of German
Pantheism&mdash;the manner of reasoning
of the latter being exactly
similar to that of the former. This
is a point of great importance,
and to which philosophers would
do well to pay a greater attention
than was done in other times, if
they admit, in the case of space,
that “the absolute is nothing until
it becomes relative,” they will have
no right to complain of the Pantheistic
applications of their own
theory.</p>

<p><i>Vacuum unmade.</i>&mdash;The third thing
we have to ascertain is, <em>whether void
space, absolutely considered as to its
reality, be created or uncreated</em>. This
point can be easily settled. Those
who say that vacuum has no objective
reality have, of course, no
alternative. For them, vacuum
must be uncreated. But they are
probably not prepared to hear that
we too, who defend the reality of
void space, do not differ from them
in the solution of this question.</p>

<p>To prove that space void of matter
is not created, the following
plain reasons may be adduced.
First, space void of matter is
neither a material nor a spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
creature. It is no material creature;
for it excludes matter. It is no
spiritual creature; for, whether
there be spiritual creatures or not,
it is necessary to admit occupable
space.</p>

<p>Secondly, no created thing is
immovable, unchangeable, and unlimited.
Absolute space is evidently
immovable, unchangeable, and
unlimited. Therefore, absolute
space is not a product of creation.</p>

<p>Thirdly, space considered absolutely
as it is in itself, exhibits an
infinite and inexhaustible possibility
of real ubications. But such a
possibility is to be found nowhere
but in God alone, in whom all possible
things have their formal possibility.
And therefore, the reality
of absolute space is all in God
alone; and accordingly, such a reality
not only is not, but could never
be, created.</p>

<p>Fourthly, whatever is necessary,
is uncreated and eternal. Space
considered absolutely as it is in itself
is something necessary. Therefore,
absolute space is uncreated and
eternal. The major of this syllogism
is evident; the minor is thus
proved: Space absolutely considered
is nothing else than the formal
possibility of real ubications; but
the possibility of things contingent
is necessary, uncreated, and eternal;
for all contingent things are possible
before any free act of the creator,
since their intrinsic possibility
does not depend on God’s volition,
as Descartes imagined, but only on
his essence as distinctly and comprehensively
understood by the divine
intellect.</p>

<p>Our next proposition will afford
a fifth proof of this conclusion.
Meanwhile, we beg of our reader
not to forget the restriction by
which we have limited our present
question. We have spoken of space
<em>absolutely considered</em> as it is in itself&mdash;that
is, of absolute space. Our
conclusion, if applied to relative
space, would not be entirely true; for
relative space implies the existence
of at least two contingent terms,
and therefore involves something
created. We make this remark because
men are apt to confound relative
with absolute space, owing to
the sensible representations which
always accompany our intellectual
operations, and also because we
think that the philosophical difficulties
encountered by many writers
in their investigation of the nature
of space originated in the latent
and unconscious assumption
that their imagination of relative
space was an intellectual concept
of absolute space. It is thus that
they were led to consider all space
void of matter as imaginary and
chimerical.</p>

<p><i>Quiddity of Absolute Space.</i>&mdash;It
now remains for us to ascertain <em>the
true nature of absolute space</em>, and to
point out its essential definition. Our
task will not be difficult after the
preceding conclusions. If absolute
space is an uncreated, infinite, eternal,
and unchangeable reality, it
must be implied in some of the attributes
of Godhead. Now, the divine
attribute in which the reason
of all possible ubications is contained,
is immensity. Hence, absolute
space is implied in God’s immensity,
and we shall see that it is nothing
else than <em>the virtuality or the
extrinsic terminability</em> of immensity
itself.</p>

<p>Before we prove this proposition,
we must define the terms <em>virtuality</em>
and <em>terminability</em>. “Virtuality”
comes from <i lang="la">virtus</i> as formality from
<i lang="la">forma</i>. Things that are actual
owe their being to their form;
hence, whatever expresses some actual
degree of entity is styled “a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
formality.” Thus, personality, animality,
rationality, etc., are formalities
exhibiting the actual being of
man under different aspects. Things,
on the contrary, that have no formal
existence, but which may be
made to exist, owe the possibility
of their existence to the power (<i lang="la">virtus</i>)
of the <em>efficient cause</em> of which
they can be the effect, or to the nature
of the <em>sufficient reason</em> from
which they may formally result. In
both cases, the things in question
are said to exist virtually, inasmuch
as they are virtually contained in
their efficient cause or in their sufficient
reason. Hence, every efficient
cause or sufficient reason, as
compared with the effects which it
can produce or with the results of
which it may be the foundation, is
said to have “virtuality”; for, the
virtuality of all producible effects,
as of all resultable relations, is to be
found nowhere but in their efficient
cause and in their formal reason.
Thus all active power has a virtuality
extending to all the acts of
which it may be the causality, and
all formal reason has a virtuality
extending to all the results of which
it may be the foundation. God’s
omnipotence, for instance, virtually
contains in itself the reality of all
possible creatures, and therefore
possesses an infinite virtuality. In
a similar manner, God’s immensity
has an infinite virtuality, as it virtually
contains all possible ubications,
and is the reason of their formal
resultability. Omnipotence has an
infinite virtuality as an <em>efficient</em>
principle; immensity has an infinite
virtuality as a <em>formal</em> source only.</p>

<p>These remarks about virtuality
go far to explain the word “terminability.”
Whenever an efficient
cause produces an effect, its action
is terminated to an actuable term;
hence, so long as the effect is not
produced, the power of the efficient
cause is merely terminable. In the
same manner, whenever a formal
reason gives rise to an actual result,
and whenever a formal principle
gives being to a potential term,
there is a formal termination; and
therefore, so long as the result, or
the actual being, has no existence,
its formal reason is merely terminable.
Hence, terminability has the
same range as virtuality; for nothing
that is virtually contained in
an efficient or in a formal principle
can pass from the virtual to the
actual state except by the termination
of an efficient or a formal act
to a potential term.</p>

<p>We have said that absolute space
is nothing else than the virtuality,
or extrinsic terminability, of God’s
immensity. The first proof of this
conclusion is as follows. Absolute
space is the possibility of all real
ubications. But such a possibility
is nothing else than the infinite
virtuality of God’s immensity.
Hence our conclusion. The major
of our syllogism is obviously
true, and is admitted by all, either
in the same or in equivalent terms.
The minor needs but little explanation;
for we have already seen that
absolute space is an uncreated
reality, and therefore is something
connected with some divine attribute;
but the only attribute in
which the possibility of all real
ubications is contained, is God’s
immensity. Hence, the possibility
of real ubications is evidently nothing
else than the extrinsic terminability
of divine immensity. In
other terms, God’s immensity, like
other divine attributes, is not only
an immanent perfection of the divine
nature, by which God has his
infinite ubication in himself, but
also the source and the eminent
reason of all possible ubications,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
because it contains them all <em>virtually</em>
in its boundless expanse.
Hence, the infinite virtuality of
God’s immensity is one and the
same thing with the possibility of
infinite ubications. And, therefore,
absolute space is nothing but the
virtuality of divine immensity.</p>

<p>Let the reader take notice that
divine immensity is, with regard to
absolute space, the <em>remote principle</em>,
or, as the Schoolmen would say, the
<i lang="la">principium quod</i>, whilst the virtuality
or extrinsic terminability of divine
immensity is the <em>proximate principle</em>,
or the <i lang="la">principium quo</i>. Hence, it
would not be altogether correct to
say that absolute space is nothing
but God’s immensity; for, as we
call “space” that in which contingent
beings can be ubicated, it is
evident that the formal notion of
space essentially involves the connotation
of something exterior to
God; and such a connotation is
not included in divine immensity
as such, but only inasmuch as it
virtually pre-contains all possible
ubications. And for this reason
the infinite virtuality of God’s immensity
constitutes the formal ratio
of absolute space. It is in this
sense that we should understand
Lessius when he says: “The immensity
of the divine substance is
to itself and to the world a sufficient
space: it is an expanse capable
of all producible nature, whether
corporeal or spiritual. For, as the
divine essence is the first essence,
the origin of all essences and of all
conceivable beings, so is the divine
immensity the first and self-supporting
expanse or space, the origin
of all expanse, and the space of all
spaces, the place of all places, and
the primordial seat and basis of all
place and space.”<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>The second proof of our conclusion
may be the following. Let
us imagine that all created things
be annihilated. In such a case,
there will remain nothing in space,
and there will be an end of all contingent
occupation, presence, or
ubication. Yet, since God will remain
in his immensity, there will
remain that infinite reality which
contains in its expanse the possibility
of infinite contingent ubications;
for there will remain God’s
immensity with all its extrinsic terminability.
In fact, God would
not cease to be in those places
where the creatures were located;
the only change would be this, that
those places, by the annihilation of
creatures, would lose the contingent
denominations which they borrowed
from the actual presence of
creatures in them, and thus all
those ubications would cease to be
<em>formal</em>, and would become <em>virtual</em>.
It is plain, therefore, that the reality
of void space must be accounted
for by the fact that, after the
annihilation of all creatures, there
remains God’s immensity, whose
infinite virtuality is equivalent to
infinite virtual ubications. Hence,
space void of matter, but filled
with God’s substance, can be nothing
else than the infinite virtuality
of divine immensity.</p>

<p>A third proof of our conclusion,
and a very plain one, can be drawn
from God’s creative power. Wherever
God is, he can create a material
point; and wherever a material
point can be placed, there is space;
for space is the region where material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
things can be ubicated. Now,
God is everywhere by his immensity;
and therefore, everywhere there
is the possibility of ubicating a material
point&mdash;that is, absolute space
has the same range as God’s immensity.
On the other hand, there
is no doubt that a material point,
by being ubicated in absolute space,
is constituted in God’s presence,
and is thus related to God’s immensity;
and this relation implies
the extrinsic termination of God’s
immensity. Therefore, the ubication
of a material point in space is
the extrinsic termination of divine
immensity; whence it follows that
the possibility of ubications is nothing
but the extrinsic terminability
of the same immensity.</p>

<p>The fourth proof of our conclusion
consists in showing that none
of the other known opinions about
space can be admitted. First, as
to the <em>subjective form</em> imagined by
Kant, we cannot believe that it has
any philosophical claim to adoption,
as it evidently defies common
sense, and is supported by no reasons.
“Kant,” says Balmes, “seems
to have overlooked all distinction
between the imagination of space
and the notion of space; and much
as he labored in analyzing the subject,
he did not succeed in framing
a theory worthy of the name.
While he considers space as a receptacle
of natural phenomena, he
at the same time despoils it of its
objectivity, and says that space is
nothing but a merely subjective
condition, … an imaginary capacity
in which we can scatter and
arrange the phenomena.”<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> “To
say that space is a thing merely
subjective,” continues Balmes, “is
either not to solve the problems of
the outward world, or to deny
them, inasmuch as their reality is
thereby denied. What have we
gained in philosophy by affirming
that space is a merely subjective
condition? Did we not know, even
before this German philosopher
uttered a word, that we had the
perception of exterior phenomena?
Does not consciousness itself bear
witness to the existence of such a
perception? It was not this, therefore,
that we wished to know, but
this only: whether such a perception
be a sufficient ground for affirming
the existence of the outward
world, and what are the relations
by which our perception is connected
with the same outward world.
This is the whole question. He
who answers that in our perception
there is nothing but a merely subjective
condition, Alexander-like,
cuts the knot, and denies, instead
of explaining, the possibility of experimental
knowledge.”<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>As to Descartes’ and Leibnitz’
opinion, which makes the reality of
space dependent on material occupation,
we need only observe that
such an opinion, even as modified
by Balmes, leads to numerous absurdities,
presupposes the material
continuity of bodies, which we have
shown to be intrinsically repugnant,<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
and assumes, by an evident
<i lang="la">petitio principii</i>, that space void of
matter is nothing. The same opinion
is beset by another very great
difficulty, inasmuch as it assumes
that the reality of space lies in
something relative, whilst it recognizes
nothing absolute which may
be pointed out as the foundation
of the relativity. This difficulty
will never be answered. In all
kind and degree of reality, before
anything relative can be conceived,
something absolute is to be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
from which the relative borrows its
relativity. On the other hand, it is
obvious that real space, as understood
by Descartes, and by Balmes
too, is something purely relative;
for “space,” says Balmes, “is
nothing but the extension of bodies
themselves”; to which Descartes
adds, that such a space “constitutes
the essence of bodies.” But
the extension of bodies is evidently
relative, since it arises from the
relations intervening between the
material terms of bodies. The
three dimensions of bodies&mdash;length,
breadth, and depth&mdash;are nothing but
distances, and distances are relations
in space. Hence, no dimension
is conceivable but through relations
in space; and therefore,
before we can have real dimensions
in bodies, we must have, as their
foundation, real space independent
of bodies. Finally, since the opinion
of which we are speaking affirms
that relative space is a reality,
while it denies that space without
bodies is real, the same opinion
lays down the foundation of real
and of ideal Pantheism, as we have
already remarked. This suffices
to show that such an opinion must
be absolutely rejected.</p>

<p>Nothing therefore remains but to
accept the doctrine of those who
account for the reality of absolute
space either by divine immensity
or by the possibility of real ubications.
But these authors, as a little
reflection will show, though employing
a different phraseology, teach
substantially the same thing; for it
would be absurd to imagine the
possibility of infinite real ubications
as extraneous to God, in whom
alone all things have their possibility.
We must, therefore, conclude
that space, considered absolutely
as to its quiddity, may be defined
to be the infinite virtuality, or extrinsic
terminability, of divine immensity.</p>

<p><i>A Corollary.</i>&mdash;Absolute space is
infinite, eternal, immovable, immutable,
indivisible, and <em>formally</em> simple,
though <em>virtually</em> extended without
limits&mdash;that is, equivalent to infinite
length, breadth, and depth.</p>

<p><i>Solution of Objections.</i>&mdash;It may be
objected that absolute space, being
only a virtuality, can have no formal
existence. In fact, the virtuality
of divine immensity is the
mere possibility of real ubications;
and possibilities have no formal existence.
Hence, to affirm that absolute
space has formal being in
the order of realities, is to give
body to a shadow. It would be
more reasonable to say that space is
contained in divine immensity just
as the velocity which a body may
acquire is contained in the power
of an agent; and that, as the power
of the agent is no velocity, so the
virtuality of immensity is no space.</p>

<p>This objection may be answered
thus: Granted that the virtuality
of divine immensity is the mere
possibility of real ubications, it
does not follow that absolute space
has only a <em>virtual</em> existence, but,
on the contrary, that, as the virtuality
of divine immensity is altogether
<em>actual</em>, so also is absolute
space. The reason alleged, that
“possibilities have no formal existence,”
is sophistic. A term which
is only possible, say, another world,
has of course no formal existence;
but its possibility&mdash;that is, the extrinsic
terminability of God’s omnipotence&mdash;is
evidently as actual as
omnipotence itself. And in the
same manner, an ubication which is
only possible has no formal existence;
but its possibility&mdash;that is, the
extrinsic terminability of God’s immensity&mdash;is
evidently as actual as
immensity itself. If absolute space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
were conceived as an array of actual
ubications, we would readily
concede that to give it a reality not
grounded on actual ubications
would be to give a body to a
shadow; but, since absolute space
must be conceived as the mere possibility
of actual ubications, it is
manifest that we need nothing but
the actual terminability of God’s
immensity to be justified in admitting
the actual existence of absolute
space.</p>

<p>Would it be “more reasonable”
to say, as the objection infers, that
space is contained in divine immensity
just as velocity is contained
in the power of the agent?
Certainly not, because what is contained
in divine immensity is the
virtuality of contingent ubications,
not the virtuality of absolute space.
There is no virtuality of absolute
space; for there is no virtuality of
possibility of ubications; as the
virtuality of a possibility would be
nothing else than the possibility of
a possibility&mdash;that is, a chimera.
Hence, the words of the objection
should be altered as follows:
“Contingent ubications are contained
in divine immensity just as
velocity is contained in the power
of an agent; for, as the power of the
agent is no actual velocity, so the
virtuality of immensity is no actual
contingent ubication.” And we
may go further in the comparison
by adding, that, as the formal possibility
of actual velocity lies
wholly in the power of the agent,
so the possibility of actual ubications&mdash;that
is, absolute space&mdash;lies
in the virtuality of divine immensity.</p>

<p>Thus the objection is solved. It
will not be superfluous, however, to
point out the false assumption
which underlies it, viz., the notion
that the extrinsic terminability of
divine immensity has only a virtual,
not a formal, reality. This assumption
is false. The terminability
is the formality under which
God’s immensity presents itself to
our thought, when it is regarded as
the source of some extrinsic relation,
<i lang="la">ut habens ordinem ad extra</i>.
Such a formality is not a mere concept
of our reason; for God’s immensity
is not only conceptually,
but also really, terminable <i lang="la">ad extra</i>;
whence it follows that such a terminability
is an objective reality in
the divine substance. Terminability,
of course, implies virtuality;
but this does not mean that such a
terminability has only a virtual
reality; for the virtuality it implies
is the virtuality of the extrinsic
terms which it connotes, and not
the virtuality of its own being.
Were we to admit that the extrinsic
terminability of God’s immensity is
only a virtual entity, we would be
compelled to say also that omnipotence
itself is only a virtual entity;
for omnipotence is the extrinsic
terminability of God’s act. But it
is manifest that omnipotence is in
God formally, not virtually. In
like manner, then, immensity is in
God not only as an actual attribute,
but also as an attribute
having an actual terminability <i lang="la">ad
extra</i>, which shows that its terminability
is not a virtual, but a formal,
reality.</p>

<p>A second objection may be made.
Would it not be better to define
space as <em>the virtuality of all ubications</em>,
rather than <em>the virtuality of
God’s immensity</em>? For when we
think of space, we conceive it as
something immediately connected
with the ubication of creatures,
without need of rising to the consideration
of God’s immensity.</p>

<p>We answer that absolute space
may indeed be styled “the virtuality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
of all ubications;” for all possible
ubications are in fact virtually
contained in it. But such a phrase
does not express the quiddity of
absolute space; for it does not tell
us what reality is that in which all
ubications are virtually contained.
On the contrary, when we say that
absolute space is “the virtuality of
divine immensity,” we point out the
very quiddity of space; for we
point out its constituent formality
which connects divine immensity
with all possible ubications.</p>

<p>True it is that we are wont to
think of space as connected with
contingent ubications; for it is from
such ubications that our knowledge
of place and of space arises. But
this space thus immediately connected
with existing creatures is
<em>relative</em> space, and its representation
mostly depends on our imaginative
faculty. Hence, this manner of
representing space cannot be alleged
as a proof that <em>absolute</em> space can
be intellectually conceived without
referring to divine immensity.</p>

<p>A third objection may be the following.
Whatever has existence is
either a substance or an accident.
But absolute space is neither a substance
nor an accident. Therefore,
absolute space has no existence,
and is nothing. The major of this
argument is well known, and the
minor is proved thus: Absolute
space does not exist in any subject,
of which it might be predicated;
hence, absolute space is not an accident.
Nor is it a substance; for
then it would be the substance of
God himself&mdash;an inference too preposterous
to be admitted.</p>

<p>This objection will soon disappear
by observing that, although
everything existing may be reduced
either to the category of substance
or to some of the categories of accident,
nevertheless, it is not true that
every existing reality is <em>formally</em> a
substance or an accident. There
are a great many realities which
cannot be styled “substances,”
though they are not accidents.
Thus, rationality, activity, substantiality,
existence, and all the essential
attributes and constituents of things,
are not substances, and yet they are
not accidents; for they either enter
into the constitution, or flow from
the essence, of substance, and are
identified with it, though not formally
nor adequately. Applying this
distinction to our subject, we say
that absolute space cannot be styled
simply “God’s substance,” notwithstanding
the fact that the virtuality
of divine immensity identifies itself
with immensity, and immensity with
the divine substance. The reason
of this is, that one thing is not said
simply to be another, unless they
be the same not only as to their reality,
but also as to their conceptual
notion. Hence, we do not say that
the possibility of creatures is “God’s
substance,” though such a possibility
is in God alone; and in the
same manner, we cannot say that
the possibility of ubication is “God’s
substance,” though such a possibility
has the reason of its being in
God alone. For the same reason,
we cannot say simply that God’s
eternity is his omnipotence, nor
that his intellect is his immensity,
nor that God understands by his
will or by his goodness, though
these attributes identify themselves
really with the divine substance
and with one another, as is shown
in natural theology. It is plain,
therefore, that absolute space is not
precisely “God’s substance”; and
yet it is not an accident; for it is
the virtuality or extrinsic terminability
of divine immensity itself.</p>

<p>A fourth objection arises from
the opinion of those who consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
God’s immensity as the foundation
of absolute space, but in such a
manner as to imply the existence
of a <em>real</em> distinction between the
two. Immensity, they say, has no
formal extension, as it has no parts
outside of parts; whereas, absolute
space is formally extended, and has
parts outside of parts; for when a
body occupies one part of space, it
does not occupy any other&mdash;which
shows that the parts of space are
really distinct from one another;
and therefore absolute space, though
it has the reason of its being in
God’s immensity, is something really
distinct from God’s immensity.</p>

<p>To this we answer, that it is
impossible to admit a <em>real</em> distinction
between absolute space and divine
immensity. When divine immensity
is said to be the foundation,
or the reason of being, of absolute
space, the phrase must not be taken
to mean that absolute space is anything
made, or extrinsic to God’s
immensity; its meaning is that
God’s immensity contains in itself
<em>virtually</em>, as we have explained, all
possible ubications of exterior
things, just as God’s omnipotence
contains in itself <em>virtually</em> all possible
creatures. And as we cannot
affirm without error that there is a
real distinction between divine omnipotence
and the possibility of
creatures which it contains, so we
cannot affirm without error that
there is a real distinction between
divine immensity and the possibility
of ubications which it contains.</p>

<p>That immensity has no parts outside
of parts we fully admit, though
we maintain at the same time that
God is everywhere <em>formally</em> by his
immensity. But we deny that absolute
space has parts outside of
parts; for it is impossible to have
parts where there are no distinct
entities. Absolute space is one
simple virtuality containing in itself
the reason of distinct ubications,
but not made up of them; just as
the divine essence contains in itself
the reason of all producible
essences, but is not made up of
them.</p>

<p>As to the <em>formal extension</em> of immensity,
Lessius seems to admit
it when he says that “God exists
in the space which his immensity
<em>formally extends</em>.” Fénelon also
holds that “immensity is infinite
extension”; whilst Balmes does not
admit that extension can be conceived
where there are no parts.
The question, so far as we can
judge, is one of words. That God
is everywhere <em>formally</em> is a plain
truth; on the other hand, to say
that he is <em>formally</em> extended, taking
“extension” in the ordinary signification,
would be to imply parts
and composition; which cannot be
in God. It seems to us that the
right manner of expressing the infinite
range of God’s immensity
would be this: “God through his
immensity is formally everywhere,
though by a virtual, not a formal,
extension.” In the same manner,
space is formally everywhere, though
it is only virtually, not formally,
extended. And very likely this,
and nothing more, is what Lessius
meant when saying that immensity
“formally extends” space. This
phrase may, in fact, be understood
in two ways; first, as meaning
that immensity causes space to be
<em>formally extended</em>&mdash;which is wrong;
secondly, as meaning that immensity
is <em>the formal</em>, not the efficient,
<em>reason</em> of the extension of space.
This second meaning, which is philosophically
correct, does not imply
the <em>formal</em> extension of space, as is
evident, unless by “formal extension”
we understand the “formal
reason of its extending”; in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
case the word “extension” would
be taken in an unusual sense.</p>

<p>Lastly, when it is objected that
“bodies occupying one part of space
do not occupy another,” and that
therefore “space is composed of
distinct parts,” a confusion is made
of absolute space, as such, and
space extrinsically terminated, or
occupied by matter, and receiving
from such a termination an extrinsic
denomination. Distinct bodies
give distinct names to the places
occupied by them; but absolute
space is not intrinsically affected by
the presence of bodies, as we shall
see in our next article; and, therefore,
the distinct denominations of
different places refer to the distinct
ubications of matter, not to distinct
parts of absolute space. As we
cannot say that the sun and the
planets are parts of divine omnipotence,
so we cannot say that their
places are parts of divine immensity
or of its terminability; for as the
sun and the planets are only extrinsic
terms of omnipotence, so are
their places only extrinsic terms of
immensity. Such places, therefore,
may be distinct from one another,
but their possibility (that is, absolute
space) is <em>one</em>, and has no parts.
But this subject will receive a
greater development in our next
article, in which we intend to investigate
the nature of relative
space.</p>

<h3>ARE YOU MY WIFE?</h3>

<p class="center">BY THE AUTHOR OF “PARIS BEFORE THE WAR,” “NUMBER THIRTEEN,” “PIUS VI.,” ETC.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE DEBUT.</span></h4>

<p>The three days had expanded to
ten when Admiral de Winton opened
the breakfast-room door on Monday
morning, and, standing on the
threshold, said in his most emphatic
manner: “Harness, I’m going up
by the 3.20 this afternoon. Now,
not a word, or I’ll bolt this minute.
… I can bear a good deal, but
there is a limit to everything.
You’ve wheedled me and bullied me
into neglecting my business for a
whole week, in spite of myself; and
I’m off to-day by the 3.20.”</p>

<p>“Well, depart in peace whatever
you do,” said Sir Simon, “and I
suppose you had better have some
breakfast before you start? It’s
struck nine already, but you will
have time to swallow a cup of tea
between this and then.”</p>

<p>“The fact is it serves me right,”
continued the admiral, advancing
to his accustomed seat at the
table; “hard-worked drudges of
my kind ought never to trust themselves
in the clutches of idle swells
like you&mdash;they never know when
they’ll get out of them. Here’s a
letter from the Admiralty, blowing
me up for not sending in that report
I was to have drawn up on the
Russian fleet; and quite right, too&mdash;only
it’s you who ought to get the
blowing up, not me.”</p>

<p>“But, uncle, I thought you had
settled to remain till Thursday,”
said Clide; “you said you would
yesterday.”</p>

<p>“One often says a thing yesterday
that one has to unsay to-day,”
retorted the admiral, clearing for
action by sweeping his letters to
one side; “I’m going by the 3.20.
I tell you I am, Harness!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve not said anything to
the contrary, have I?”</p>

<p>“But you needn’t be trying to
circumvent me, to make me late for
the train, or that sort of thing. I’m
up to your dodges now. Ryder will
be on the look-out; he’s packing
up already.”</p>

<p>“I must say its rather shabby
behavior to Lady Anwyll,” observed
the baronet; “the dinner and
dance on Wednesday are entirely
for you and Clide.”</p>

<p>“Clide must go and make the best
of it for me; an old fellow like me is
no great loss at a dinner, and I don’t
suppose she counted much on me
for the dance. How much longer
do you intend to stay here, eh?”
This was to his nephew.</p>

<p>“What’s that to you?” said Sir
Simon, interrupting Clide, who was
about to answer; “you’d like him to
do as you are doing&mdash;set the county
astir to entertain him, and then decamp
before anything comes off.”</p>

<p>But the admiral was not to be
moved from his determination by
any sense of ill-behavior to the
county. He started by the 3.20.
Sir Simon and Clide went to see
him off, and called at The Lilies on
their way back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s perfectly useless, he never
would consent to it; and in any case
it’s too late now,” Sir Simon remarked,
with his hand on the wicket;
“it’s for Wednesday, and this is
Monday. We should have thought
of it sooner.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll speak to him anyhow;
it may serve for next time,”
urged Clide in a low voice; “it’s
cruel to see her cooped up in this
way.”</p>

<p>It was as Sir Simon guessed.
M. de la Bourbonais would not
hear of Franceline’s going to Lady
Anwyll’s. Why should he? He
did not know Lady Anwyll, and
he was not likely to accept an invitation
that had clearly been sent
at somebody else’s request, at the
eleventh hour. But quite apart
from this he would never have
allowed his daughter to go. He
never went out himself, and his
paternal French instinct repelled as
a monstrous <i lang="fr">inconvenance</i> the idea
of letting her go without him&mdash;above
all, for a first appearance.</p>

<p>“But, happily, Franceline does
not care about those things,” he said;
“she has never been to a party, as
you know. She is happier without
amusements of the sort; her doves
are all the amusement she wants.”</p>

<p>“Hem!… I’m not so sure of
that, Bourbonais,” said Sir Simon;
“we take for granted young people
don’t care for things because we
have ceased to care for them; we
forget that we were young once
upon a time ourselves. Why should
Franceline not enjoy what other
young girls enjoy?”</p>

<p>“She is not like other young
girls,” replied her father, in a tone
of gentle sadness.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately for other girls
and for mankind in general,” assented
Sir Simon.</p>

<p>Raymond smiled.</p>

<p>“I meant that their circumstances
are not alike. You know
they are not, mon cher.”</p>

<p>“You make mountains out of
mole-hills, Bourbonais,” said the baronet;
“however, I give in about this
hop of Lady Anwyll’s. It wouldn’t
quite do to bring Mlle. de la Bourbonais
out in that fashion; she must be
presented differently; those youngsters
don’t consider these important
points.” And he nodded at Clide,
who had sat listening with none
the less interest because he was
silent. “But something must be
done about it; the child can’t be
thrown any longer on her doves for
society; she must have a little
amusement; it will tell on her health
if she has not.”</p>

<p>It was not without intention that
he pointed this arrow at Raymond’s
shield. Sir Simon knew where his
vulnerable spot lay, and that it was
possible to make him do almost
anything by suggesting that it might
affect his child’s health. He had,
so far, no grounds for alarm, or even
anxiety about it; but the memory
of her mother, to whom she bore in
many ways so strong a resemblance,
hung over him like the shadow of
an unseen dread. It was this that
conquered him in the riding scheme,
reducing him into acquiescence
with what he felt was not frankly
justifiable. Sir Simon had indeed
assured him that Lord Roxham had
declined to take Rosebud; but he
did not explain the circumstances.
Clide had taken a fancy to the
spirited bay mare, and on the very
morning after the letter was despatched
he announced his intention
of riding her while he remained;
whereupon the baronet, more keenly
alive to the courtesies of a host
than the obligations of a debtor,
instead of telling him how matters
stood, wrote a second letter on receipt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
of Lord Roxham’s accepting
the offer, to say he could not let
him have the horse for a week or
so, and as Lord Roxham wanted
her immediately as a present for his
intended bride, he could not wait,
and thus £1,000 slipped out of Sir
Simon’s hands. Mr. Simpson, his
incomparable man of business, had,
however, stopped the gap by some
other means, and the rascally architect
was quieted for the present.</p>

<p>Raymond observed that Lord
Roxham was not the only person
in England who was open to the
offer of a mare like Rosebud, though
it might be difficult to meet with
any one willing to give such an exorbitant
price for her; one does
not light on a wealthy, infatuated
bridegroom every day. “Yes, that’s
just it,” replied Sir Simon, grasping
at any excuse for procrastination,
“one must bide one’s time; it’s a
mistake selling for the sake of selling;
if you only have patience
you’re sure to find your man by-and-by.”
And Raymond, feeling
that he had done all that he was
called upon to do in the case, recurred
to it no more, and was satisfied
to let Franceline use the horse.
There was no doubt the exercise
was beneficial to her. Angélique
said her appetite had nearly doubled,
and the child slept like a dormouse
since she had taken the riding;
and as to the enjoyment it
afforded her, there could be no
mistake about that.</p>

<p>Sir Simon had promised to think
over what next should be done to
amuse his young favorite, and he
was as good as his word. He gave
the matter, in ministerial parlance,
his most anxious consideration, and
the result was that he made up his
mind to give a ball at the Court,
where Franceline should make her
<i lang="fr">début</i> with the <i lang="fr">éclat</i> that became
her real station and the hereditary
friendship of the two families. He
owed this to Raymond. It was
only fitting that Franceline should
come out under his roof, and be presented
by him as the daughter of
his oldest and most valued friend.
He was almost as fond of the child,
too, as if she were his own; and besides,
it was becoming desirable at
this moment that her position in
society should be properly defined.
He came down to breakfast big
with this mighty resolution, and
communicated it to Clide, who at
once entered into the plan with
great gusto, and had many valuable
hints to give in the way of decorations;
he had seen eastern pageants,
and Italian and Spanish <i lang="es">festas</i>, and
every description of barbaric gala
in his travels, and his ideas were
checked by none of the chains that
are apt to hamper the flights of
fancy in similar cases. Sir Simon
had never hinted in his presence
at such a thing as pecuniary embarrassments,
and there was nothing
in the style and expenditure at
the Court to suggest their existence
there. Sir Simon winced a little as
Clide unwittingly brought his practical
deception home to him by
speaking as if money were as plentiful
as blackberries with the owner
of Dullerton; but he was determined
to keep strictly within the
bounds of reason, and not to be
beguiled into the least unnecessary
extravagance.</p>

<p>“Bourbonais would not like it,
you see; and we must consider him
first in the matter. It will be better
on the whole to make it simply a
sort of family thing, just a mustering
of the natives to introduce
Franceline. It would be in bad
taste to make a Lord Mayor’s day
of it, as if she were an heiress, and
so on. We’ll just throw all the rooms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
open, and make it as jolly as we
can in a quiet way. I’ll invite everybody&mdash;the
more the merrier.”</p>

<p>So they spent a pleasant hour or
so talking it all over; who were to
be asked to fill their houses, and
what men were to be had down
from London as a reserve corps for
the dancing. They had got the
length of fixing the date of the ball,
when Sir Simon remembered that
there was the highly important
question of Franceline’s dress to be
considered.</p>

<p>“I must manage to get her up to
London, and have her properly
rigged out by some milliner there.
I dare say your stepmother would
put us up to that part of the business,
eh?” And Clide committed
his stepmother to this effect in a
most reckless way. It had already
been mooted with Raymond by Sir
Simon that Franceline should go to
London for a few days to see the
sights, and he could fall back on
this now for the present purpose.
He was surprised to find that Raymond
consented to the proposal,
not merely without reluctance, but
almost with alacrity.</p>

<p>“If you really think the change
will do her good, I shall be only
too grateful to you for taking her,”
he said; “but does it strike you
she wants it?”</p>

<p>Sir Simon felt a slight shock of
compunction at this direct question,
and at the glance of timid inquiry
that accompanied it. He had never
intended to distress or alarm his
friend; he only made the remarks
about Franceline’s health as a means
of compassing his own ends towards
amusing and pleasing her.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it!” he answered
contemptuously; “what could have
put such a notion into my head?
When I say a little change of one
sort or another will do her good, I
only judge from what I hear all the
mothers say; when their daughters
are come to Franceline’s age they’re
constantly wanting change, and if
they are too long without it they
begin to droop, and to look pale,
and so forth, and the doctor orders
them off somewhere. I don’t imagine
Franceline is an exception to
the general rule; and as prevention
is better than cure, it’s as well to
give her the change before she feels
the want of it. It’s a good plan
always to take time by the forelock;
you see yourself that the riding has
done her good.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mon cher, yes,” said M. de
la Bourbonais, tilting his spectacles,
“it certainly has strengthened
her. She has lost that pain in her
side she used to suffer from, though
I never knew it&mdash;I only heard of it
when it was gone. Angélique should
not have concealed it from me,” he
added, a little nervously, and with
another of those inquiring looks at
Sir Simon.</p>

<p>“Pooh, pooh, nonsense! What
would she have worried you about
it for? All young people have pains
in their sides,” returned the baronet
oracularly. “She’s not done growing
yet. Well, then, it’s settled that
I carry her off on Monday. We
will start early, so as to be there to
receive Mrs. de Winton, who arrives
at Grosvenor Square by the
late afternoon train.”</p>

<p>“But there is one thing you must
promise me,” said Raymond, going
up to him and laying a hand impressively
on his arm; “you will go
to no unnecessary expense. You
must give me your word for that.”</p>

<p>“There you are, as usual, harping
on the old string,” laughed the
baronet, with a touch of impatience.
“What expense do you expect
me to go to? The house is
there, and the servants are there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
and whether I’m there or not the
expenses go on. You don’t suppose
Franceline will add very
heavily to them, or Mrs. de Winton
either?”</p>

<p>“But you talked about taking her
to the operas, and so on, and I am
sure she would not care for amusements
of that sort; they would be
too exciting for her. The change
of scene and the sights of the city
will be quite enough.”</p>

<p>“Make your mind easy about all
that. Mrs. de Winton will take
care the child doesn’t overdo herself.
She’s a very sensible woman,
and not at all fond of excitement.”</p>

<p>As the baronet pronounced Mrs.
de Winton’s name, it occurred to
him for the first time to wonder if
it suggested nothing to Raymond,
and whether Clide’s assiduity at The
Lilies, and prolonged stay at Dullerton
after his announcement that
he was only to remain three days,
awoke no suspicion in his mind. The
thing would have been impossible
in the case of any other father; but
Raymond was so absorbed in his
studies, in hunting out and analyzing
the Causes of the Revolution, the
proposed title of the work that was
to be Franceline’s <i lang="fr">dot</i>, and so altogether
unlearned in the common
machinery of life, that he was capable
of seeing the house on fire, and
not suspecting it concerned him
until it singed his pen. He knew
that Clide’s meeting with him had
been a turning-point in the young
man’s life; that it was Raymond’s
advice and influence that determined
him to return to Glanworth, and
enter on his duties there with a
vigorous desire to fulfil them at the
sacrifice of his own plans and inclinations.
He was already acting
the part of mentor to Clide, who
carried him his agent’s letters to
read, and consulted him about the
various philanthropic schemes he
had in his head for the improvement
of the people on his estate&mdash;notably
the repression of drunkenness,
which Raymond impressed on
him must be the keystone of all
possible improvement among the
humbler classes in England. Was
it possible that this demeanor and
the son-like tone of respect which
Clide had adopted toward him suggested
no ulterior motive on Clide’s
part, or awoke no parental fear or
suspicion in Raymond? Sir Simon
was turning this problem up and
down in his mind, and debating
how far it might be advisable to
sound his friend, when Raymond
said abruptly:</p>

<p>“Mr. de Winton is not going
with you, of course?”</p>

<p>“No; he is to run down to his
own place while we are away. I
expect him back when we return.”</p>

<p>Their eyes met. Sir Simon
smiled a quizzical, complaisant
smile, but it died out quickly when
he saw the alarmed expression in
Raymond’s face.</p>

<p>“The idea never struck me before,”
he exclaimed. “How should
it? There was nothing to suggest
it; the disparity is too great.”</p>

<p>“How so? They are pretty well
matched in age&mdash;eighteen and eight-and-twenty&mdash;and
as to Clide’s family,
he cannot certainly count quarterings
with the De Xaintriacs, or
perhaps even the Bourbonais; but
the De Wintons are…”</p>

<p>“Enfantillage,<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> enfantillage!”
broke in Raymond with a gesture of
wild impatience; “as if it signified in
a foreigner living in exile whether his
family be illustrious or not, when it
is decayed and without the smallest
actual weight or position! The disparity
I allude to is in fortune. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
such a barrier between my daughter
and Mr. de Winton, how could
any arrangement have entered into
my imagination?”</p>

<p>“And you have actually lived all
these years in England without getting
to understand Englishmen and
their ideas better than that!” said
Sir Simon. “As if it mattered that”&mdash;snapping
his fingers&mdash;“about any
difference in fortune! Why half
the wealthiest men I know have
married girls without a penny. I
did it myself,” added the baronet,
with a change from gay to grave in
his tone; “my wife had no fortune
of her own, and if she had, I
wouldn’t have taken a penny with
her. No man of spirit, who has a
fortune large enough to support his
wife properly, likes to take money
with her. Clide de Winton has
£15,000 a year, and no end of
money accumulating in the funds;
he hasn’t spent two years’ income
these last eight years, I’ll lay a
wager; it would be a crying shame
if he were to marry a wife with
money; but he’s not the man to do
it.”</p>

<p>M. de la Bourbonais had risen,
and was walking up and down with
his hands behind his back and his
chin on his breast, his usual attitude
when he was thinking hard.
It was the first time that the idea
of Franceline’s marriage had come
home to him in any practical form&mdash;indeed,
in any form but that of a
remote and shadowy abstraction
that he might or might not be some
day called upon to discuss. He
had not discussed his own marriage,
and there was no precedent in his
mind for discussing hers. As far
as his perceptions carried him,
those things were entirely arranged
by outsiders; when everything was
made ready in the business department,
the parties concerned were
brought together, and the wedding
took place. But what business
was there to arrange in
Franceline’s case? If Mr. de Winton
had been a high-born young
gentleman without a penny to bless
himself with, there would have
been some sense in his being proposed
as a candidate for Mlle.
de la Bourbonais; but it was
against all law and precedent that
a millionnaire should dream of marrying
a girl without a <i lang="fr">dot</i>.</p>

<p>“This is very foolish” he said,
taking another turn up the long
room&mdash;they were in the library&mdash;“if
it occurred to you before, you
should have told me.”</p>

<p>“Told you what? That Mlle.
de la Bourbonais was a deuced
pretty girl, and Mr. de Winton
a remarkably good-looking
young man, neither blind nor devoid
of understanding. I should
think you might have found that
out for yourself.”</p>

<p>“It is not a thing to joke about,
Simon. I cannot understand your
joking about it.” And Raymond
halted before Sir Simon, who was
lounging back in his chair, his
coat thrown back, and his thumbs
stuck into his waistcoat, while
he surveyed his friend’s anxious
face with a look of comical
satisfaction. “Has Mr. de Winton
spoken to you on the subject?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Have you said anything to him
about it?”</p>

<p>“Not I!”</p>

<p>“And yet you speak as if you
had something to go upon.”</p>

<p>“And so I have. I have my
eyes and my intelligence. I have
been making use of both during
the last ten days.”</p>

<p>“Then am I expected to speak
to him?”</p>

<p>“You are expected to do nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
of the sort,” said the baronet,
starting from his listless attitude,
and speaking in a determined manner;
“it does not concern you at
this stage of affairs. If you interfere
you may just put your foot in
it. Leave the young people to
manage their own affairs; they understand
it better than we do.”</p>

<p>“Not concern me!” echoed
Raymond, protruding his eyebrows
an inch beyond his nose; “and if
this idea, that seems so clear to you,
should seem clear to others, and
nothing comes of it, how then?
My child is compromised, and I am
not to interfere, and it does not
concern me?”</p>

<p>“You talk like an infant, Bourbonais!”
said Sir Simon, changing
his bantering tone to one of resentment.
“Am I likely to encourage
De Winton if I did not
know him; if I were not certain
that he is incapable of behaving
otherwise than as a gentleman!”</p>

<p>“But you confess that he has not
said anything to you; suppose he
should never have thought of it at
all?”</p>

<p>“Suppose that he’s a blind
idiot! Is it likely that a young
fellow like Clide should be thrown
into daily society with a girl like
Franceline and not fall in love
with her? Tell me that!”</p>

<p>But that was precisely what Raymond
could not see. His mental
vision was not given to roaming
beyond the narrow horizon of his
own experience: this furnished him
with no precedent for the case in
point&mdash;a young man falling in love
and choosing a wife without being
told to do so by his family.</p>

<p>“If it were suggested to him,”
he replied, dubiously, “no doubt
he might; but no one has put it
into his head; even you have not
given him a hint to that effect.”</p>

<p>Sir Simon threw back his head
and roared.</p>

<p>“Really, Bourbonais, you’re too
bad! ’Pon my honor you are. To
imagine that a man of eight-and-twenty
waits for a hint to fall in
love when he has the temptation
and the opportunity! But you
know no more about it than the
man in the moon. You live in the
clouds.”</p>

<p>“I have lived in them perhaps
too long,” replied Raymond, humbly
and with a pang of self-reproach.
“I should have been more
watchful where my child was concerned;
but I fancied that her poverty,
which hitherto has cut her off
from the enjoyments of her age,
precluded all possibility of marriage&mdash;at
least until the fruit of my
toil should have given her a right
to think of it. It seems I was mistaken.”</p>

<p>“And are you sorry for it?”</p>

<p>Raymond walked to the window,
and looked out for a moment before
he answered.</p>

<p>“Admitting that the immense disparity
in fortune were <em>not</em> an insuperable
barrier, there is another
that nothing would overcome in
Franceline’s eyes&mdash;he is not a
Catholic.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is. At least he ought
to be; his mother was a Catholic,
and he was brought up one.</p>

<p>“Strange that he should not have
mentioned that to me!” said Raymond,
musing; “but then how is it
that we did not see him in church
last Sunday?”</p>

<p>“Hem!… I’m not quite sure
that he went; it was my fault.
I kept them both up till the small
hours of the morning talking over
business, and so on,” said Sir Simon,
throwing the mantle of friendship
over Clide’s delinquency.
“You know it does not do to draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
the rein too tight with a young fellow.
He’s been so much abroad,
and unhappy, and that sort of thing,
you see; but a wife would bring
him all right again, and keep him
up to the collar.”</p>

<p>“Franceline would attach paramount
importance to that, Harness,”
said the father, with a certain
accent of humility; he did not
dare insist on it in his own name.</p>

<p>“Of course she would, dear little
puss, and quite right; but she won’t
be too hard on him for all that.”</p>

<p>It required all Sir Simon’s powers
of persuasion to make Raymond
promise that he would leave things
alone, and not speak either to Clide
or Franceline on the subject of
this conversation. He gave the promise,
however, feeling in some intangible
way that the possibility of
Franceline’s marriage under such
unprecedented, such unnatural circumstances,
in fact, was a phenomenon
too far beyond his ken for
him to meddle with in safety. It
was decided that she should go to
London on the day appointed, as
if nothing had transpired between
the friends since the proposed visit
had been agreed to.</p>

<p class="break">A ball anywhere at Dullerton
was always a momentous occasion,
stirring the stagnant waters with
pleasurable agitation; but a ball at
the Court was an event of such
magnitude that it set the neighborhood
in movement like a powerful
electric shock. It was, compared
to ordinary entertainments of the
kind, what a Royal coronation is to
a Lord Mayor’s show. Wonderful
reports were afloat as to the magnificence
of the preparations that
were going on. Nobody had been
allowed to see them; but conjecture
was busy, and enough transpired
to excite expectation to the
highest pitch. It was known that
men had been brought down from
London with vans full of all sorts
of appliances for transforming the
solemn Gothic mansion into a fairy
palace. How the transformation was
to be effected no one had the vaguest
idea, and this made expectation
all the more thrilling.</p>

<p>It was indeed but too true that
Sir Simon had abandoned his first
wise intention of making it no more
than a gay mustering of the clans.
Fate so ordained that just at this
time he got news of the rapidly
declining health of his interesting
relative, Lady Rebecca Harness.
“She cannot possibly hold out over
the autumn; her physician allowed
as much to transpire to a professional
friend of mine, so we must
be prepared for the worst,” wrote
Mr. Simpson; “it is certainly providential
that the £50,000 and the
reversion of her ladyship’s jointure
should fall in at this moment.”
And Sir Simon felt that he could
not better express his grateful sense
of the providential coincidence, and
at the same time cheer himself up
under the impending bereavement,
than by giving for once full play to
the oriental element of hospitality
and magnificence, so long pent up
in him by a sordid bondage to economy.</p>

<p>“Clide, that idea of yours about
turning the Medusa gallery into a
moonlight walk, with palms and
ferns, and so on, was really too
good to be lost. I think we must
have the Covent Garden people
down to do it. And then the Diana
gallery would make a capital pendant
in the Chinese style. It’s really
a pity to do the thing by halves;
I owe it to Bourbonais to do it handsomely
on an occasion like this; and,
hang it! a couple of hundreds more
or less won’t break a man, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span></p>

<p>And Clide being decidedly of
opinion that it would not, the Covent
Garden people were had down,
and preparations went on in right
royal style.</p>

<p>M. de la Bourbonais had been
informed that a dance was in view
for the purpose of introducing Franceline,
and accepted the intelligence
as a part of the mysterious web
that was being woven round him
by unseen hands. Perhaps he
vaguely connected the event with
something like a <i lang="fr">soirée de contrat</i>,
or a forerunner of it, and this would
account for his passive acquiescence,
and the tender, preoccupied
air that marked his manner during
the foregoing week. Sir Simon, like
a wily diplomatist as he was, managed
to keep Clide from going to
The Lilies for nearly the entire
week, by throwing the whole burden
of overseer on him, filling his
hands so full of commissions for
London, and shifting the responsibility
of everything so completely
on his shoulders that he had scarcely
time to eat or sleep, being either
on the railroad or in a state of
workmanlike <i lang="fr">déshabillé</i> that made
it impossible for him to show himself
beyond the precincts of the
scene of action until dinner-hour,
when Sir Simon was always abnormally
disinclined for a walk, and
insisted on being read to or otherwise
entertained by his young friend
till bed-time.</p>

<p>Franceline, meanwhile, had her
own preoccupations. Not about
her dress&mdash;that had been settled
to her utmost satisfaction, being
aided by the combined action of
Mrs. de Winton and that lady’s
French milliner. But there was
another important matter weighing
heavily upon her mind. It was
just three days before the great
day. Mr. de Winton had rushed
down with the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> for
M. de la Bourbonais, apologizing
profusely to Franceline, who was
sitting in the summer-house, for
presenting himself in such a state
of undress, and saying something to
the effect that it was the servants’
dinner-hour, and they were so
much engaged, etc. But he could
not keep the count waiting for the
book, which ought to have been
sent several days ago. No, he
would not disturb the count at that
hour, if Mlle. Franceline would be
kind enough to take the book and
explain about the delay. Franceline
promised to do so; which was
rash, considering that she did not
understand a word about it, or that
there was any delay whatever.</p>

<p>“Oh! I may as well profit by the
opportunity to ask if you are engaged
for the first waltz on Thursday?”
said Mr. de Winton, turning
back after he had gone a few steps,
as if struck by a happy thought.</p>

<p>No, Franceline was not engaged.</p>

<p>“Then may I claim the privilege
of the first-comer, and ask you for
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thank you. I shall be
very happy.”</p>

<p>And she began immediately to be
very miserable, remembering that
she did not know how to waltz,
never having had a dancing lesson
in her life. She shut up her book,
and set out toward the vicarage.
She never felt quite at home with
the Langrove girls; but they were
the essence of good nature, and
perhaps they could help her out of
this difficulty. She was ashamed
to say at once what had brought
her, and went on listening to them
chattering about their dresses,
which were being manufactured out
of every shade of tarlatan in the
rainbow. Suddenly Godiva exclaimed:
“I wonder if you’ll have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
any partners, Franceline? Do you
think you will? You know you
don’t know anybody? You’ve
never even spoken to Mr. Charlton.”
And Franceline, crushed
under a sense of this and another
inferiority, blushed, and said “No.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Mr. de Winton will ask
you? Oh, I should think he’s sure
to. Hasn’t he asked you already?”
And Franceline, painfully conscious
of ten eyes staring at her, blushed
deep crimson this time, and answered
“Yes”; and then, suddenly
recollecting that she had something
important to do, she said good-by
and hurried away. She had not
closed the gate behind her when
the five Misses Langrove who were
“out” had rushed up to the nursery
and informed the five who were
not “out” that Franceline de la
Bourbonais was engaged to that
handsome, rich young Mr. de Winton,
who had £60,000 a year and
the grandest place in Wales. Only
fancy!</p>

<p>“How stupid I was to get red
like that, instead of telling the truth
and asking Isabella to teach me
how to do it!” was Franceline’s
vexed exclamation to herself, as
she entered the garden, and, swinging
her sunshade, looked up at her
doves perched on a branch just behind
the chimney that was curling
its blue rings up against the deeper
purple of the copper-beech.</p>

<p>“What is my child meditating
on so solemnly?” said M. de la
Bourbonais, meeting her at the
door; and taking her face between
his hands, he looked into the dark,
deep eyes that had never had a
secret from him. Had they now?
He had watched her walking up the
garden, and noticed that fold in the
smooth, white brow; he was always
watching her of late, though Franceline
did not perceive it.</p>

<p>“I am worried, petit père. I wish
I were not going to this ball!” And
she leaned her cheek against his
with a sigh.</p>

<p>Raymond started as if he had
been stabbed.</p>

<p>“My child! my cherished one!
what is it? What has happened?”</p>

<p>“O petit père! it’s nothing,” she
cried eagerly, smitten with remorse
by his look of anguish. “It’s not
worth being unhappy about; only
I never thought of it before, and
now I’m afraid it can’t be helped.
They will ask me to dance, and I
don’t know how.”</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu! it is true. We
should have thought of that. It
was very heedless of us all. But
there must be a master here who
could give thee some lessons, my
child. We will speak to Miss
Merrywig. Stay, where’s my hat?
There is no time to be lost.”</p>

<p>But Franceline checked him.
“Petit père, I should be ashamed
to get a master now; every one
would know about it and laugh at
me; all the young girls would make
such fun of me.”</p>

<p>“What dances dost thou want to
dance?” inquired her father, knitting
his brows, as if searching some
forgotten clew in the background
of memory; “I dare say I could
recall the <i lang="fr">minuet de la cour</i> a little,
if that would help thee.”</p>

<p>“I never hear them speak of it.
I don’t think they dance that now;
only quadrilles and waltzes,” said
Franceline.</p>

<p>“Ah! quadrilles were after my
day; but the <i lang="fr">valse à trois temps</i> I
knew once upon a time. Come
and let us see if I cannot remember
it.”</p>

<p>They went into the dining-room,
pushed the table and chairs into a
corner, and M. de la Bourbonais,
fixing his spectacles as a preliminary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
step, put himself into position;
his right foot a little in advance,
his eye-brows very much protruded,
and his head bent forward; he
made the first steps with hesitation,
then more boldly, assisting his memory
by humming the tune of an old
waltz.</p>

<p>Angélique, who was spinning in
the room overhead, came down to
see what the table and chairs were
making all this clatter about, and
burst in on a singular spectacle:
her master pirouetting to the tune
of <i lang="fr">un, deux, trois!</i> round the eight-feet
square apartment, while Franceline,
squeezed against the wall,
held up her skirt so as to afford a
full view of her shabby little boots,
and tried to execute the same evolutions
in a space of one foot square.</p>

<p>“Papa is teaching me to waltz,”
explained the pupil, not looking up,
but keeping her eyes stuck on the
professor’s feet lest she should miss
the thread of their discourse.</p>

<p>“Well, to be sure! To think of
Monsieur le Comte’s remembering
his steps at this time of day! What
a wonderful memory monsieur
has!” was Angélique’s admiring
comment.</p>

<p>“Now, then, shall we try it together?”
said M. de la Bourbonais,
and placing his arm round Franceline,
the two glided round the room,
the professor whistling his accompaniment
with as much emphasis
as possible, while the pupil counted
one, two, three, and Angélique kept
time by clapping her hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, petit père, I shall do it beautifully!”
cried Franceline, suspending
the performance to give
him an energetic kiss that nearly
sent his spectacles flying across the
room. “Now if you only could
teach me the quadrille!”</p>

<p>But this recent substitute for the
art of dancing was beyond the scope
of Raymond’s abilities; quadrilles,
as he said, had come into fashion
long after his time. It was a grand
thing, however, to have accomplished
so much, and Franceline
felt a sense of triumphant security
in her newly-acquired possession
that cleared away all her tremors.
She spent the rest of the afternoon
practising the <i lang="fr">valse à trois temps</i>, so
as to be quite perfect in it. Sir
Simon found her thus profitably
employed when he came down just
before his dinner with a newspaper.</p>

<p>“What were we all thinking about
not to have remembered that?”
was his horrified exclamation.
“Why, of course you must know the
quadrille; you will have to open
the ball, child. You must come up
this evening to the Court, and we’ll
have a private little dancing lesson,
all of us, and put you through the
figures.”</p>

<p>And so they did; and the result
was so successful that, when the
great day came, Franceline felt
quite sure of being able to behave
like everybody else. Her dress
came down with Mrs. de Winton
on the eve of the ball, and she was,
in accordance with that lady’s desire,
to dress at the Court under her
supervision.</p>

<p>It was a new era in Franceline’s
life, finding herself arrayed in a
fairy robe of snow-white tulle, with
wild roses creeping up one side of
it, and a cluster of wild roses in her
hair. Angélique stood by, surveying
the process of transformation
with arms a-kimbo, too much impressed
by the splendors of the
whole thing to vindicate her rights
as <i lang="fr">bonne</i>, and quite satisfied to see
her natural functions usurped by
nimble Croft, Mrs. de Winton’s
maid. But when that experienced
person whipped up the gossamer
garment and shook it like an apple-tree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
and tossed it with a sweep
over Franceline’s head, it fairly
took away her breath, for the pink
petals stuck on in spite of the shock,
and the soft flounces foamed all
round just in the right place, rippling
down from the neck and
shoulders, and flowing out behind
like a sea-wave. Then Croft crowned
it all by planting the pink cluster
in the hair just as if it grew there.
Mrs. de Winton came in at this
crisis, however, and suggested that
they would be more becoming a
little more to the front.</p>

<p>“Well, ma’am, if you’ll take the
responsibility,” demurred the abigail
with pinched lips, and stepping
aside as if to get clear of all participation
in the rash act herself, “in
course you can; but my maxiom
always was and is, as modesty is
the most becoming ornament of
youth; if you put them roses forwarder,
anybody’ll see as how it
was meant to be a set-off to the
complexion&mdash;as you might say, putting
a garding rose alongside of a
wild one, to see which was the best
pink.”</p>

<p>“Oh! indeed, it’s very nicely
done; it could not possibly be better,”
said Franceline earnestly.
She was rather in awe of the fine
lady’s maid, and looked up appealingly
to Mrs. de Winton not to
gainsay her; but that serene lady
paid no more heed to the abigail’s
protest than she might have done
to the snarling of her pet pug.
With deft and daring fingers she
plucked out the flowers, pushed the
rich, bright coils to one side so
as to make room for them, and then
planted them according to her
fancy. If the change were done
with a view to the effect foretold by
Mrs. Croft, there was no denying it
to be a complete success. Angélique,
by way of doing something,
took up a candle and held it
at arm’s length over Franceline’s
head, making short chuckling noises
to herself which the initiated knew
to be expressive of the deepest satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Now, my dear, I think you will
do,” said Mrs. de Winton, looking
up and down the young girl with
a smile of placid assent, while she
washed her long, tapering hands
with the old Lady-Macbeth movement;
“let us go down.”</p>

<p>Sir Simon and the Admiral and
M. de la Bourbonais were assembled
in the blue drawing-room,
where the guests were to be received,
when the two ladies entered.
Mrs. de Winton, in the mellow splendor
of purple velvet, old point, and
diamonds, looked like the protecting
divinity of the cloud-clad
nymph tripping shyly after her. An
involuntary murmur of admiration
burst from the Admiral and Sir
Simon, while M. de la Bourbonais,
all smiles and joy, came forward to
embrace Franceline.</p>

<p>“O my dear child!…”</p>

<p>“Count, take care of her roses!”
cried Mrs. de Winton, ruffled into
motherly alarm as she saw Franceline,
utterly oblivious of her headgear,
nestling into her father’s neck.</p>

<p>Raymond started, and looked
with deep concern to see if he had
done any mischief. Happily not.</p>

<p>“Come here and let me look at
you!” said Sir Simon, holding her
at arm’s length out before him.
“They’ve not made quite a fright
of you, I see&mdash;eh, admiral?”</p>

<p>“Dear Sir Simon, it’s all a great
deal too pretty. It’s like being in a
story-book, my lovely dress and everything?”
said Franceline, standing
on tip-toe to be kissed.</p>

<p>Mr. de Winton came in at this
juncture.</p>

<p>“I say, Clide, it’s rather hard on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
us to have to stand by and not follow
suit,” grumbled the admiral.</p>

<p>Franceline crimsoned up; the
bare suggestion of such a possibility
as the words implied made her
heart leap up with a wild throb. She
did not mean to look at Clide, but
somehow, involuntarily, as if moved
by some mesmeric force, their eyes
met. It was only for a moment, but
that rapid, mutual glance sent the
life-current coursing through her
young veins with strange thrills of
joy. Clide had turned quickly to
point out something in the decorations
to his uncle, and Franceline
slipped her arm into her father’s,
and began to admire the beauty of
the long vista of parlors leading on
to the ball-room, where the orchestra
was already inviting them to the
dance with abrupt flashes of music,
one instrument answering another
in sudden preludes, or chords of
sweetness “long drawn out.”</p>

<p>“You have not seen the galleries
yet,” said Sir Simon; “come and look
at them before the crowd arrives.”</p>

<p>They followed him into the Medusa
gallery, and the transition
from the brilliant glare of wax-lights
to the subdued twilight of
the blue dome, where mimic stars
were twinkling round a silver crescent,
was so solemn and unexpected
that Raymond and Franceline stood
on the threshold with a kind of awe,
as if they had come upon sacred
precincts. Tall ferns and palms nodded
gently in the blue moonlight,
swayed by some invisible agent. The
change from this to the gaudy brilliancy
of the Diana gallery was in
its way as striking; myriads of Chinese
lanterns were swinging from
the ceiling; some peeped through
flowers and plants, and some were
held by Chinese mandarins with
pig-tails and embroidered bed-gowns.</p>

<p>“Are they real Chinamen?” enquired
Franceline in a whisper, as
she passed close by one of them
and met his eyes fixed on her with
the appreciating glance of an outer
barbarian.</p>

<p>“Real! To be sure they are. I
imported a small cargo of them
from Hong Kong, pig-tails and all,
for the occasion,” replied Sir Simon.</p>

<p>But a twinkle in his eye, and a
broad grin on the face of the genuine
John Chinaman, belied this
audacious assertion. Franceline
laughed merrily.</p>

<p>“How clever of you to have invented
it, and how exactly like real
Chinamen they are!” she cried, intending
to be complimentary to all
parties; which the mandarin under
consideration acknowledged by a
slow bend of his skull-capped head
and a movement of the left hand
towards the tip of his nose, supposed
to represent a native salutation.</p>

<p>“Bestow your commendation
where it is due,” said Sir Simon;
“it’s all that young gentleman’s
doing,” pointing with a jerk of his
head towards Clide, who had sauntered
in after them. “But here
comes somebody; we must be under
arms to receive them.”</p>

<p>The baying of the bloodhounds
chained in the outer court announced
the arrival of a carriage;
they reached the reception-room in
time to hear it wheeling up the terrace.</p>

<p>And now the master of Dullerton
Court was in his element. The
tide of guests poured in quickly,
and were greeted with that royal
courtesy that was his especial attribute.
No matter what the worries
and cares of life might be elsewhere,
they vanished as if by enchantment
in the sunshine of Sir
Simon’s hospitality. He forgot nobody;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
the absent ones had their
tribute of regret, and he remembered
the precise cause of the absence:
the daughter who had an inopportune
toothache, the son forced
to remain in town on business, and
the father pinned to his bed by the
gout; Sir Simon was so sorry for
each individual absentee that while
he was expressing it you would
have imagined this feeling must have
damped his joy for the evening;
but the cloud passed off when he
shook hands with the next arrival,
and he was radiantly happy in spite
of sympathetic gout and toothache.</p>

<p>Mrs. de Winton seconded her
host well in doing the honors. If
she was a trifle stiff, it was such a
graceful, well-bred stiffness that
you could not quarrel with it, and
she neglected no one.</p>

<p>“There are Mr. Langrove and
the girls!” exclaimed Franceline,
in high excitement, as if that inevitable
spectacle were an extraordinary
surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh! how gorgeous you are, Franceline,”
was Godiva’s awe-stricken
<i lang="it">sotto voce</i>, as if she feared that loud
speech might blow away the bubble.</p>

<p>“And what a delicious fan! Do
let me look at it!” panted Arabella
in the same subdued tone.</p>

<p>“Oh! but look at her shoes,”
cried Georgiana, clasping her hands
and looking down, amazed, at the
white satin toe, with its dainty pink
rosette, that protruded from under
the skirt.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad you like it all,” said
Franceline, delighted at the <i lang="fr">naïve</i>
and good-natured expressions of
admiration. They were all as artless
as birds, the Langrove girls,
and had not a grain of envy in their
composition.</p>

<p>“Oh! there’s Mr. Charlton,”
whispered Matilda, nudging Alice
to look as the observed-of-all-observers
in Dullerton appeared in
the doorway.</p>

<p>The room was now full to overflowing,
and the crowd, swayed
by one of those spontaneous movements
that govern crowds, suddenly
poured out of the blue drawing-room
into the adjoining ones, leaving
the former comparatively empty.
Franceline was following the stream
when Sir Simon called out to her:</p>

<p>“Don’t run away; come here to
me. I want to introduce you to my
friend Lady Anwyll. Mlle. de la
Bourbonais&mdash;I was going to say,
my daughter, but unfortunately she
is only the daughter of my oldest
friend and second self, the Comte
de la Bourbonais; you have met
him, I believe?”</p>

<p>Lady Anwyll had had that distinction,
and was charmed now to
make his daughter’s acquaintance.
She had none of her own to dispose
of, which the wily Sir Simon perhaps
remembered when he singled
her out for this introduction.</p>

<p>“You’ll see that she has a few
partners. I dare say they won’t be
very reluctant to do their duty with
a little pressing.”</p>

<p>“It’s the only duty young men
seem equal to nowadays,” said
the plump old lady, nodding in the
direction of a group of the degenerate
race; and she drew Franceline’s
hand through her arm, and
bore her off like a conquest.</p>

<p>“Who’s that girl? She’s awfully
pretty! What color are her eyes&mdash;black,
blue, or brown? I’ve not
seen such a pair of eyes this season,
by Jove!” drawled a <i lang="fr">blasé</i> young
gentleman from the metropolis.</p>

<p>“You’re a luckier man than your
betters if you have ever seen a pair
like them,” retorted Mr. Charlton,
superciliously; “that’s the belle of
the evening, Mlle. de la Bourbonais.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ll be a good fellow, and introduce
me&mdash;eh, Charlton?” said his
friend.</p>

<p>But Mr. Charlton turned on his
heel without committing himself
further than by a dubious “I’ll
see about it.” His position as
native gave him the whip-hand over
all interlopers, and he meant to let
them know it.</p>

<p>And now the orchestra has burst
out in full storm, and engaged
couples are hunting for each other
amidst the vortex of tarlatan and
dress-coats. Clide has found his
partner and led her to the top of
the room, where Sir Simon and
Lady Anwyll are waiting for their
<i lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i>. A little lower down, Miss
Merrywig is standing up with Mr.
Charlton.</p>

<p>“How very absurd of him, my
dear,” the old lady is protesting to
Arabella Langrove, who made their
<i lang="fr">dos-à-dos</i>; “but he will have me
dance the first quadrille with him.
Was there ever anything so absurd!”</p>

<p>Arabella was too polite to contradict
her; and Mr. Charlton bent
down to assure Miss Merrywig there
was no one in the room he could
have half as much pleasure in opening
the evening’s campaign with;
a speech which was overheard by
several neighboring young ladies,
who commented on it in their own
way, while Franceline, who beheld
with surprise the ill-assorted couple
stand up together, thought it showed
very nice feeling on the part of
Mr. Charlton to have selected the
dear old lady for such a compliment,
and that she looked very pretty in
her lavender watered silk and full
blonde cap with streamers flying.
But it was quite clear that Miss
Bulpit thought differently. That
estimable and zealous Christian had
with much difficulty been persuaded
by Sir Simon to condescend so
far to sanction the vanities of the
unconverted as to be present at the
ball, and she had discarded her
funereal trappings of black bombazine
for the mitigated woe of black
satin; but the cockade of limp black
feathers that sprouted from some
hidden recess where her back hair
was supposed to be protested sorrowfully
against the glossy levity
of her dress, and bobbed with a
penitential expression that was
really affecting. Mr. Sparks was
hawking her about like a raven in
a carnival. <em>He</em> entered into her
feelings; it was chiefly the desire to
support her by his countenance and
sympathy that had brought him to
this scene of ungodly dissipation.</p>

<p>Franceline was terribly nervous
in the first figure, and Clide felt it
incumbent on him to give her his
utmost help in the way of prompting
beforehand, and commendation
when the feat was over. They got
on swimmingly until the third figure,
when she became hopelessly entangled
in the ladies’-chain, giving her
hand to Lady Anwyll instead of
Sir Simon, and then rushing back
to Clide, while Sir Simon rushed
after her and made everything
inextricable.</p>

<p>“Really, governor, you’re too
bad!” protested Mr. de Winton;
“why don’t you mind what you’re
about? You’re putting my partner
out disgracefully!”</p>

<p>Sir Simon bore the broadside
with heroic magnanimity, apologized
to everybody all round, except
Clide, who ought to have called
him to order in time, and not let
him go bungling on, confusing
everybody. By the time he had
done scolding and they had all got
into position again, the figure was
over. The rest of the quadrille
was got through without any mishaps
to speak of, and when Clide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
carried his partner off for a promenade
in the moonlit gallery, assuring
her that she had done it all
beautifully, Franceline felt that the
praise, for being a trifle strained,
was none the less due. Other
couples followed them in amongst
the ferns and palms, and Franceline
was soon besieged by entreating
candidates for the next dances.
Mr. Charlton came up with the
graceful self-possession that belongs
to six thousand pounds a year and
a decidedly handsome and rather
effeminate face, and requested the
favor of a quadrille. It was promised,
and he stood by her side and
in that earnest tone that was acknowledged
to be so captivating by
all the young ladies of Dullerton
asked Mlle. de la Bourbonais if this
was her first ball.</p>

<p>“Ah! I thought so. One can always
tell by the freshness with
which people enjoy it. For my own
part, I confess I envy every one
their first experience of this kind;
it so soon wears off&mdash;the pleasure, I
mean&mdash;and one feels the insipidity
of it. Perhaps you already anticipate
that?” There was a depth of
expression in her face that suggested
this remark. Mr. Charlton
considered himself a reader of
character&mdash;a physiognomist, in fact.</p>

<p>“Oh! no,” exclaimed Franceline,
with artless vehemence; “I
don’t think I should ever get tired
of it; it’s far more enjoyable than
I imagined!”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed! Well, just so;
it’s as people feel; for my part I
think it’s a mistake&mdash;I mean getting
<i lang="fr">blasé</i> of things;” and he ran a turquoise
and diamond finger through
his curly straw-colored hair.</p>

<p>“I hate people who are <i lang="fr">blasé</i>,”
was the unconventional rejoinder;
“they are always so tiresome and
woe-begone. Papa always says he
feels under a personal obligation to
people for being happy; they do
him good&mdash;like dear little Miss
Merrywig, for instance. I’m sure
she’s not <i lang="fr">blasé</i> of anything; how
she did enjoy herself in the quadrille!
And it was so pretty to see
her dancing her demure little old-fashioned
steps.”</p>

<p>“She’s a very old friend of yours,
is she not, Charlton?” said Clide.</p>

<p>“Oh! yes; since before I was
born. She’s a dear old girl, if she
would only not bother one to guess
what she gave for her buttons,” replied
Mr. Charlton. “But just see
here! Is our Christian friend trying
to deal with Roxham?”</p>

<p>Miss Bulpit was coming across
the conservatory out of the Diana
gallery, leaning on Lord Roxham,
with whom she was conversing in
an earnest manner.</p>

<p>“Oh! here you are, Roxham.
I’ve been hunting for you this quarter
of an hour,” called out Sir Simon,
appearing from behind a
mandarin who was holding a tray
full of tea-cups to the company.
“Franceline, my friend Lord Roxham
has threatened to shoot me if
I don’t get him a dance from you;
so in self-defence I had to make
over my right to the first waltz. I
couldn’t do more, or less. What do
you say, Miss Bulpit?”</p>

<p>Miss Bulpit considered Sir Simon
was behaving very handsomely.</p>

<p>“It’s easy to be generous at other
people’s expense,” observed Mr.
de Winton, tightening his grasp on
the light arm that was obediently
slipping from him; “it so happens
that Mlle. de le Bourbonais has
promised the first waltz to me.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to disappoint you, my
dear fellow, but you might have
had a little thought for other people’s
rights. You won’t deny that I
deserve an early favor?” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
baronet, with playful peremptoriness.</p>

<p>“Dear Sir Simon, I never thought
of your asking me,” said Franceline
penitently.</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s it,” said the baronet,
shaking his head; “that’s sure to
be the way of it; we poor old
fogies get shoved out of the way
by the youngsters. Well, you see
I’m letting you off easier than you
deserve. Roxham, we’ll change
partners, if Miss Bulpit does not
object to taking an old man instead
of a young one.”</p>

<p>Franceline was again going to
draw her arm away, but again the
tightening grasp prevented her. She
looked up at Clide; but he was
looking away from her, his mouth
set in a rigid expression, and an
angry fold divided the straight
brows that lay like bars across his
forehead.</p>

<p>“Mlle. de la Bourbonais promised
me this dance,” he said, coldly,
to Lord Roxham.</p>

<p>“But I overrule the promise; she
had no business to give it without
consulting me, naughty, unfeeling
little person! Come, De Winton,
make way for my deputy!” And
with a nod and a laugh that were
clearly not to be trifled with, he
beckoned Clide to follow him.</p>

<p>Franceline looked up with the
beseeching glance of a frightened
fawn as Clide released her arm, and
with a low bow walked away. She
was ready to cry; but there was
nothing for it but to accept Lord
Roxham’s proffered arm, and go into
the ball-room where in a moment
she was caught up and was
whirling mechanically along with
the waltzers. She was too preoccupied
to be nervous about the performance
that she had looked forward
to with so much trepidation,
and so she acquitted herself admirably.
Her partner stopped after
the first round to let her take
breath.</p>

<p>“Yes, thank you, I am a little
giddy; I am not accustomed to
dancing.”</p>

<p>So they stood under the colonnade.
Lord Roxham would have been a
pleasant partner if Franceline had
been in a mood to enjoy his lively
talk on all sorts of subjects. He
saw there were likely to be breakers
ahead between Clide and some one
about this dance; but he had had
nothing to say to that. He felt rather
aggrieved than otherwise, being
forced, as it were, on a girl against
her will, or at any rate without her
being consulted. And it was hard
on De Winton, whether he particularly
held to his pretty partner
or not. What the dickens did Harness
mean by meddling in it at all?
He was not given to putting spokes
in other people’s wheels. Lord
Roxham was very intelligent, but
though furnished with an average
share of masculine conceit, it never
occurred to him to think that the
falling through of his marriage lately,
and the fact of his being the
eldest son of a peer with a fine estate&mdash;a
good deal encumbered, but
what of that?&mdash;might afford any
clue to Sir Simon’s odd behavior.</p>

<p>“No, I did not mean in the political
issue of the contest; ladies
are not expected to take much interest
in that part of the business,”
he was saying to his partner; “but
they are apt to get up very warm
partisanship for the candidates, irrespective
of politics.”</p>

<p>“Who are the candidates?” inquired
Franceline.</p>

<p>Lord Roxham laughed.</p>

<p>“Poor wretches! They <em>are</em> to
be pitied. Sir Ponsonby Anwyll
on the Conservative side and Mr.
Charlton for the Liberals.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Charlton! He is then
clever? Can he make speeches?”</p>

<p>Lord Roxham laughed again, and
hesitated a little before he replied:
“It’s rather a case, I fancy, of the
man who could not say whether he
could play the fiddle, because he
had never tried. We none of us
know what we can do till we try.
Charlton does not strike you as
having the making of an orator in
him, I see.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t know. I spoke to
him to-night for the first time; he
did not give me the idea of a person
who could make speeches and
laws; one must be very clever to
get into Parliament, must he not?”</p>

<p>“If elections were conducted on
the competitive examination system,
one might assume that; but
I’m afraid we successful candidates
can hardly take our success as the
test of merit,” said her companion.
“I see you have rather a high standard
about electioneering.”</p>

<p>Franceline had no standard at
all, and was full of curiosity to hear
about the mysteries of canvassing
and constituents, and the poll, from
some one who had gone through
the various stages of the battle, from
being pelted with rotten eggs on
the hustings to the solemn taking
possession of a legislator’s seat
in the Imperial Parliament. A
legislator must be a kind of hero.
She was glad to have met one.
Lord Roxham, who liked to hear
himself talk, proceeded to enlighten
her to the best of his ability; he
had no end of droll electioneering
stories to tell, and scandalous tales
of corruption through the medium
of gin-shops, etc.; he opened her
eyes in horror by his account of
the rotten-borough system, and the
rottenness of the law-making machine
in general, touching the heroes
of the Liberal party with a light dash
of satire and caricature that brought
the dimples out in full force in Franceline’s
cheeks, and made her laugh
merrily; in short, he was so lively
and entertaining that she was quite
sorry when he held out his arm for
them to start off again in the dance.
As they stepped from under the
colonnade, she saw Clide leaning
against a pillar at the other side,
with his eyes fixed on her.</p>

<p>“Oh! stop, please,” pleaded
Franceline, after one turn over
the spacious floor, and they rested
for a moment; just as they did so,
a couple flew past&mdash;Mr. de Winton
and a very beautiful girl, as tall as
Franceline, but in no other way resembling
her; her hair was black
as ebony, with black eyes and a
clear olive complexion.</p>

<p>“Who is that lady?”</p>

<p>“Lady Emily Fitznorman, a
cousin of mine.”</p>

<p>“How beautiful she is! I never
saw any one so handsome!”</p>

<p>“Did you not?” with an incredulous
smile, then looking quickly
away. “She is a very striking person;
she is the belle of <em>our</em> county.
You look warm; shall we
take a turn in the galleries?”</p>

<p>Franceline assented. Passing
through the conservatory, they came
upon two persons seated in a recess,
partly screened by a large fan-leaved
plant. It was Clide and Lady
Emily; she was talking with great
animation, gesticulating with her
fan, while he sat in an attitude of
deep attention, his elbows resting
on his knees, and his head bent
forward. Franceline felt a sudden
shock at her left side, as if her heart
had stopped, while a spasm of pain
shot through her, making every
fibre tingle. What was this olive-skinned
beauty saying to Clide that
he was listening to with such rapt
attention? He did not even look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
up, though he must have seen who
was passing. Poor Franceline! what
tremor is this that shakes her from
head to foot, convulsing her whole
being with one fierce throb of angry
emotion! Poor human heart! the
demon of jealousy had but to blow
one breath upon it, and she whose
life had hitherto been a sort of inverse
metempsychosis of a lily and
a dove, was transformed into a woman
fired with passionate vindictiveness,
longing to snatch at another
human heart and crush it.
But the woman’s pride, that woke
up with the pain, came instinctively
to her assistance. She began talking
rapidly to Lord Roxham, sinking
her voice to the <i lang="it">sotto voce</i> of confidence
and intimacy, so that he had
to lower his head slightly to catch
what she was saying; thus they
swept by the two in the recess,
without glancing towards them.</p>

<p>Clide meantime had seen it all.
He had been straining every nerve
to catch what Franceline was saying,
and was voting his friend Roxham
a confounded puppy, whose
conceited head he would have much
pleasure in punching on the first
opportunity. He could not punch
Sir Simon’s, though he deserved it
more than Roxham.</p>

<p>“May I ask you for an explanation
of your behavior to me just
now, Sir Simon?” he had said to
his host as soon as Miss Bulpit had
set him free; “what did you mean
by interfering with me in that manner?”</p>

<p>“Did I interfere with you?” was
the supercilious retort, with a bland
smile. “I’m very sorry to hear it;
but I think I had a right to the
second dance from a young lady
whom I consider my adopted
daughter.”</p>

<p>“If it had been for yourself I
should have yielded without a
word; but it was for Roxham you
shoved me aside.”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose I choose to elect
a deputy to do my duty? I had a
right to choose Roxham.”</p>

<p>“I fancied I might have had a
prior claim.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Then you should have
told me so. How was I to know
it?&mdash;Well, vicar, I see your young
ladies are in great request; how
does Miss Godiva happen to be in
your company?”</p>

<p>“What can he be driving at?”
muttered Clide, as his host turned
away to get a partner for Godiva
Langrove; “has he been fooling
me all this time&mdash;is he playing
me off against Roxham? And is
she&mdash;” He walked into the ballroom,
and there saw, as we know,
Lord Roxham and Franceline very
happy in each other’s society.</p>

<p>He went straight to Lady Emily
Fitznorman, and asked her for the
waltz that was going on. She was
<i lang="fr">fiancée</i> to a friend of his, he knew;
so he was safe so far, and she had
plenty to say for herself, and he must
talk to some one. He was not a man
to show the white feather, whatever
he might feel. He kept steadily
aloof from Franceline after this,
and Lord Roxham, taking for granted
that he had been mistaken in his
first impressions, secured her for
three more dances, which was all
he dared do in the face of Dullerton.</p>

<p>Franceline was grateful to him.
She felt suddenly forsaken in the
midst of the gay crowd, as if some
protecting presence had been withdrawn.
Her father was playing
<i lang="fr">piquet</i> in some distant region where
there were card-tables. But even
if he had been within reach, there
was something stirring in her newly-awakened
consciousness that would
have prevented her seeking him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
Clide should not see that he had
grieved her. She could enjoy herself
and be merry without him, and
she would let him see it!</p>

<p>“Has the honor of taking you
in to supper been already secured,
mademoiselle?” said Mr. Charlton,
making sure at this early stage that
it had not, and coming up to claim
it with the air of elaborate grace
that springs from the habit of easy
conquest.</p>

<p>“Yes, it has,” replied Lord Roxham,
quickly taking the answer out
of Franceline’s mouth. “I was
before you in the field, Charlton, I
am happy to say.”</p>

<p>“How could you tell such a
story?” whispered Franceline, with
an attempt to look shocked when
Mr. Charlton had gone away.</p>

<p>“I told you everything was considered
fair in electioneering,” replied
the member of Parliament.</p>

<p>“Then electioneering must be
very bad for everybody who has to
do with it, if it teaches them to tell
stories and call it fair.”</p>

<p>But she promised, nevertheless,
to act as accomplice in this particular
case of badness, and to let him
take her in to supper. He came to
claim his privilege in due time, and
they went in together. But the
tables were already so crowded that
they could not find two contiguous
seats. Some one beckoned to Lord
Roxham that there was a vacant
chair higher up, on a line with
where they stood. He elbowed his
way through the crowd, and seized
the chair, and placed Franceline
in it. She was sitting down before
she noticed that her next neighbor
was Clide de Winton. He was
busily attending to the wants of
Lady Emily, but turned round
quickly on feeling the chair taken,
and moved his own an inch or so
to make more space. At the same
moment he looked up to see who
Franceline’s attendant was. “Can’t
you find a seat, Roxham? I’ll make
way for you presently. We have
nearly done.” There was not a
trace of vexation in his manner, or
in his face.</p>

<p>“No hurry! I can bear up for ten
minutes more,” replied his friend,
good-humoredly; “but help me to
attend to Mlle. de la Bourbonais.
What will you begin with?” bending
over her chair.</p>

<p>Franceline did not care. Anything
that was at hand.</p>

<p>“Then let me recommend some
of this jelly; it is pronounced excellent
by my partner,” said Clide,
politely, and scanning the well-garnished
table to see what else he
could suggest.</p>

<p>“Thank you. I will take some
of these chocolate bonbons.”</p>

<p>“Nothing more substantial?”</p>

<p>“Bonbons are always nourishment
enough for me. I think I
could live on them without anything
stronger; I have quite a passion
for them&mdash;my French nature
coming out, you see.”</p>

<p>She spoke very gayly. He helped
her without looking at her. She
made a feint of nibbling the <i lang="fr">pralines</i>,
but she could not swallow;
her heart was beating so hard and
loud she fancied Clide must hear it.</p>

<p>“Roxham, suppose you made
yourself useful and get a glass of
champagne for these ladies,” said
Clide. “Waylay that fellow with the
bottle there.”</p>

<p>Lord Roxham charged valiantly
through the crowd, snatched the
bottle from the astonished flunky,
and bore it away in triumph over
the heads of the multitude.</p>

<p>“Well done! That’s what I call
a brilliant manœuvre,” said Clide,
laughing. “No, you must help them
yourself; you deserve that reward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
after such a feat of arms, and
Mlle. de la Bourbonais, who has a
great admiration for heroes, will
drink to your health I daresay.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been trying to excite her
admiration by the recital of my heroic
exploits at the last elections;
but I’m afraid I rather scandalized
her instead,” said the young man, as
he poured the sparkling wine into
her glass.</p>

<p>“Served you right,” said Lady
Emily, with cousinly impertinence;
“when people fish for compliments
they generally catch more snakes
than eels.”</p>

<p>“Roxham, will you reach me
those sandwiches?” cried a gentleman
struggling with a lady on his
arm beyond arm’s length of the
table. Lord Roxham immediately
went to his assistance, and some one
else instantly pressed into his place
behind Franceline.</p>

<p>“We had better go now, if you
have quite finished,” said Clide to
Lady Emily.</p>

<p>Franceline made a movement to
rise, but sat down again; Clide’s
chair was on her dress.</p>

<p>“Oh! I beg your pardon. Have
I done any mischief?” he exclaimed,
starting up and lifting his chair;
the foot had caught in the tulle and
made a slight rent.</p>

<p>“Oh! I am so sorry. I beg your
pardon a thousand times!” he said
with great warmth and looking deeply
distressed.</p>

<p>“It’s of no consequence; it will
never be noticed,” she answered,
gently.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry!” Clide repeated.
Their eyes met at last; he was disarmed
in an instant.</p>

<p>“Will you dance with me now?”
he said almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>They were soon in the ball-room
again.</p>

<p>“Why did you turn me off in that
way? Was it that you preferred
dancing with Roxham?”</p>

<p>“O Clide!” The words escaped
her like the cry of a wounded
bird, and, with as little sanction of
her free will, the tears rose.</p>

<p>He made no answer&mdash;no audible
one at least; but there is a language
in a look sometimes that is more
eloquent than speech. Franceline
and Clide dwelt for a moment in
that silent glance, and felt that it
was drawing their hearts together
as flame draws flame.</p>

<p>She never knew how long the
dance lasted; she only knew that
she was being borne along, treading
on air, it seemed to her, and encompassed
by sweet sounds of music as
in a dream. But the dream was
over, and she was being steadied on
her feet by the strong protecting
arm, and Clide was looking down
upon her from his six feet of height,
the frown that had made the dark
bars over his eyes look so formidable
a little while ago quite vanished.</p>

<p>“Is Sir Simon angry with us?”
she asked, looking up into his face.</p>

<p>“Not he! Why should he be
angry with us? And if he were,
what does it matter?” he added, in
a voice of low-toned tenderness;
“what does anything matter so long
as we are not angry with each
other?”</p>

<p>He drew her hand within his arm,
and they walked on in silence.
Franceline’s heart was too full for
words. Was it not part of her happiness
that this new-found joy
should be overshadowed by a
vague and nameless fear?</p>

<h3>THE CARDINALATE.<br />
<span class="smaller">SECOND AND CONCLUDING PAPER.</span></h3>

<p>The manner of creating Cardinals
has differed in different ages.
Moroni<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> (<cite>Dizionario</cite>, ix. p. 300,
<i lang="la">et seq.</i>) gives a description of the
ancient, the mediæval, and the
modern ceremonies used on the occasion.
In the earliest period of
which there are details we know
that the pope created the cardinals
on the ember-days of Advent
in the churches of the Station.
There were three stages in the
proceeding: the first on Wednesday
at S. Mary Major’s, the
second in the Twelve Apostles’, and
the third in S. Peter’s. The subjects
of the cardinalate were called
out in the first two churches by
a lector after the pope had read
the Introit and Collect of the solemn
Mass; but in the last one, the
pope himself declared such an one
to be elected cardinal-priest, or
deacon, by a formula the beginning
and essential words of which were:
“Auxiliante Domino Deo et Salvatore
Nostro Jesu Christo, <i lang="la">eligimus</i>
in ordinem diaconi Sergium
(for instance) subdiaconum.” The
cardinal-elect then received from
the pope “inter missarum solemnia,”
the necessary Order of the
diaconate or priesthood. In those
days there was a much stricter connection
required between the (sacred)
character of a subject and his
order in the cardinalate than there
now is, when a bishop often belongs
to the presbyterial and a priest to
the diaconal order. In the Middle
Ages, cardinals were no longer
created during Mass or in church
in presence of the people; but at
the pope’s residence of the Lateran,
before the Sacred College. The
season was still the same and the
custom of creating them only on a
fast-day of December lasted for
over six hundred years.</p>

<p>In the mediæval creations three
consistories were held in the Apostolic
Palace, of which two were
secret and one was public. In the
first consistory the pope deputed
two cardinals to go around to the
house of every sick or legitimately-absent
cardinal and get his opinion
on these points: Ought there to be
a creation? And if so, of how
many?</p>

<p>On the return of the deputies the
pope asked the cardinals present the
same questions. All voted thereon;
and after the votes had been
counted, if the pope saw fit he
pronounced that he followed the
advice of those who were in favor&mdash;“Nos
sequimur consilium dicentium,
quod fiant.” Then the cardinals
voted on the number to be
created, and after the counting of
the votes, the pope said that he
followed the advice of those who
proposed that six (for instance)
should be created&mdash;“Nos sequimur
consilium dicentium, quod fiant
sex.” After a recommendation to
reflect maturely, and deliberate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
upon the persons proper to be elected,
the consistory broke up. On
the Friday following it assembled
again, and when two cardinals, sent
out for the purpose as on the first
day, had returned with the names
of those suggested by the absent
ones, the pope commanded an
empty chair to be brought&mdash;“Portetur
nuda cathedra.” Then the
cardinals all stood up behind the
two rows of benches that ran down
the great <i lang="la">aula consistorialis</i>, and the
senior advanced and, sitting down
beside the pope, was made acquainted
in a low voice with the names of
those whom the pope wished to
create, and was asked his opinion.
“Quid tibi videtur?” As soon
as the cardinal had answered, the
next one went up, and so on until
all had been heard. The pope then
announced the result of this auricular
consultation and declared such
and such persons created cardinals
of the Holy Roman Church. The
next day a public consistory was
held in which they were solemnly
published; after which the elect
were introduced and heard an
allocution addressed to them by
the pope on the duties and dignity
of their office, and received from
his hands the large hat, with the
designation of their churches. All
the cardinals dined that day with
the pope, and in the afternoon the
new ones went in grand cavalcade
to take possession of their Titles or
Deaconries, as the case might be.</p>

<p>In more recent times, that is,
about 1646, when Lunadoro wrote
his celebrated account of the Roman
court,<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> the manner of creating
was almost as at present, except
that the now unheard-of Cardinal
<em>Nephew</em> (who was called in
Italian&mdash;<i lang="la">vae, vae!</i>&mdash;Il cardinale <i lang="it">Padrone</i>)
had a large share in the ceremonies,
as he doubtless had a decided
influence in the nominations, and
that the red <i lang="it">beretta</i>, or cap, was
placed on the head of the elect by
the pope himself, with the words
<i lang="la">Esto cardinalis</i>, and the sign of the
cross. According to the modern
ceremonial, the pope summons a
consistory, and, after delivering an
appropriate address, asks the cardinals
their opinion with the customary
(but, since the XVth century,
rather perfunctory) formula, “What
think ye?” Then they rise, take
off their caps, and bow assent;
whereupon the pope proceeds to
create the new cardinals in the
words: “By the authority of Almighty
God, of the blessed apostles
Peter and Paul, and of our own,
etc.”</p>

<p>On account of the present Piedmontese
occupation of Rome, the
subsequent ceremonial has to be
dispensed with in the case of those
cardinals who may be there at the
time of their elevation to the dignity.
Those who are absent receive
the lesser insignia of their
rank from two papal messengers;
one of whom is a layman and member
of the Noble Guard, carrying
the <i lang="it">zucchetto</i>, or skull-cap, the
other an ecclesiastic of some minor
prelatic rank in the pope’s household,
bringing the <i lang="it">beretta</i>. If the
head of the state be a Catholic, he is
permitted to place the cap (brought
by the ablegate) upon the new cardinal,
the function taking place in
the royal chapel; but in other
countries a bishop or archbishop is
appointed by the pope for the purpose.</p>

<p>At one period, particularly during
the XVIth century, many serious
scandals were occasioned by the
practice of betting on or against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
the advancement of certain individuals
to the cardinalate, and some
who had staked heavily were convicted
of resorting to infamous calumnies
to hinder the nomination
of those against whom they had
betted. Things finally became so
outrageous that Gregory XIV., in
1591, issued a bull in which excommunication,
already declared, was
pronounced against any one who
should presume to wager on the
promotion of cardinals (Bul. 4, Gregory
XIV. <i lang="la">cogit nos</i>).</p>

<p>The expression applied to a cardinal
of being or having been reserved
<i lang="la">in petto</i>, means to be created
but (for reasons known only to the
pope) not published or promulgated
as such. It is not certainly known
when this practice began, and the
subject has been so often confounded
with that of <em>secret</em> creation that
it is difficult to assign a precise
date. The secret creation was
simply the creation of a cardinal
without the usual ceremonial. It
originated with Martin V. (Colonna),
probably urged thereto by the
jealousies and dangers that still
lingered after the great schism of
the West was happily ended. The
other cardinals were consulted, and
notice was given to the honored
individual, who was not, however,
allowed to assume the distinctive
ornaments or the station of his
rank. In the <i lang="la">in petto</i> appointments,
only the pope and perhaps his
<i lang="la">Uditore</i>, or some extremely confidential
person bound to secrecy,
know the names of those reserved.
It is related of a certain prelate,
Vannozzi, who was much esteemed
by Gregory XIV. for his varied learning
and long services, that having
been commissioned one day to take
note of the names of a few cardinals
to be created in the next consistory,
he had the satisfaction to
be ordered to write his own name
in the list. Although bound to
secrecy, he was weak enough to
give in to the importunate solicitations
of the Cardinal Nephew and
show him the paper, which coming
to the pope’s ears, he called the
prelate and made him erase his
name&mdash;and that was the end of
Vannozzi.</p>

<p>A cardinal created, but reserved
<i lang="la">in petto</i>, if he be subsequently published,
takes precedence of all others
(in his order) created subsequently,
notwithstanding the reservation.
If the pope wish to create and reserve
in this manner, after publishing
the names of the cardinals
created in the ordinary way, he uses
the formula: “Alios autem duos
(for example) in pectore reservamus
arbitrio nostro quandocumque
declarandos.” It is believed
that Paul III. (Farnese, 1534-49)
was the first to reserve <i lang="la">in petto</i>;
and we think that he may have done
so to reward attachment to faith and
discipline in that heretical age without
seeming to do so too openly, to
avoid its having an interested look.
The celebrated Jesuit (himself a
cardinal) and historian of the
Council of Trent, Sforza Pallavicini,
gives a curious reason&mdash;that certainly
shows how great was the idea
entertained in his day, the middle of
the XVIIth century, of the Roman
cardinalate&mdash;why the expression
<em>creation</em> of a cardinal is officially
used; and says (vol. 1. p. xiii.)
that it is meant to intimate by the
word that the excellence of the
dignity is so exalted that all degrees
of inferior rank are as though they
were not; so that when the pope
makes a man a cardinal, it is as if
in the sphere of honors he called him
out of non-existence into being.</p>

<p>In the first consistory held, in
which the newly-created cardinals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
appear, the pope performs on them
the ceremony of Sealing the Lips
(more literally of Closing the
Mouth). It is done in the following
formula: “Claudimus vobis os,
ut neque in consistoriis neque in
congregationibus aliisque functionibus
cardinalitiis sententiam vestram
dicere valeatis.” At the end of
the consistory, when the junior
cardinal-deacon rings a little bell,
the pope unseals their lips by saying
(in Latin): “We open your
mouths, that in consistories, congregations,
and other ecclesiastical
functions, ye may be able to speak
your opinion. In the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost, Amen”; making over
them meanwhile three times the
sign of the cross. This custom
must be pretty old, for it is mentioned
in the XIIIth century by Cardinal
(Stefaneschi) Gaetani, nephew
of Pope Boniface VIII., as already
in existence. It has been conjectured
that the intention of such a
ceremony was to pass the newly-created
cardinals through a kind
of novitiate before receiving what
is called, in canon law, the active
and passive voice, <i>i.e.</i>, the right of
electing and of being elected to
the pontificate; but it may also
have been intended to impress
upon them the necessity of prudence
and modesty of speech in
such august assemblies.</p>

<p>The College of Cardinals is the
seed and germ of the papacy, and
the greatest act that one of its
members can perform is to take
part in a papal election. This is
done in a convention called the
<em>Conclave</em>, which is subject to many
regulations, as becomes so important
an occasion. The present
order of this assembly dates
from the pontificate of Gregory
XV., in 1621. When Rome was
not occupied by some sacrilegious
invader, it took place in the Quirinal
Palace by secret voting, the
votes being opened and counted in
a chapel called, from the circumstance,
<em>Capella Scrutinii</em>. When the
election was complete, the senior
cardinal-deacon, whose office corresponds
to that of the ancient archdeacons
of the Roman Church,
announced it to the people. Originally,
however, the cardinals were
not the only electors of the pope,
but any foreign bishop in communion
with the Holy See, who
happened to be present during a
vacancy, was permitted to take
part in the election. Thus, when
Cornelius was exalted to the Chair
of Peter, in 254, sixteen such bishops,
of whom two were from
Africa, concurred in the act. The
rest also of the Roman clergy
had some voice in the election, but
it was greatly weakened by Pope
Stephen III. <i lang="la">alias</i> IV., in a council
held at the Lateran in the year 769,
who made it obligatory to elect a
member of the Sacred College.
Alexander III., by the advice and
with the approval of the eleventh
General Council (third of Lateran),
in 1179, considering the difficulties
arising out of a great number of
electors (no less than thirty-three
schisms having already been occasioned
thereby), solemnly decreed
that in future the cardinals alone
should have the right to choose, confirm,
and enthrone the pope, and that
two-thirds of the votes cast would be
necessary for a canonical election.
Lucius III., his successor in 1181,
was the first pope elected in this
manner by the exclusive action of
the Sacred College. This wise provision
was confirmed for the edification
of the faithful, and to show
that the bishops dispersed throughout
the church did not claim any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
share in the election of its head, by
the general councils of Lyons (IId)
in 1274, and Vienne in 1311. But
once since have any others had an
active voice in the matter, which
was at Constance, when the twenty-three
cardinals, to put an end to
the schism, opened the conclave
for this time only to thirty prelates,
six from each of the five great nations
represented there. This resulted
in the election of Martin V.
(Colonna) on November 11, 1417.
Since the year 1378 no one not a
cardinal has been elected pope;
but before that time a good many,
despite the decree of Stephen III.
(or IV.), were elected without being
cardinals; six in the XIth, two in
the XIIth, three in the XIIIth, and
three in the XIVth century. Of
these were S. Celestine V. and, before
him, Blessed Gregory X. A
curious circumstance attended the
election of the latter, in which the
cardinals were treated as jurymen
who are locked up until they agree
upon a verdict. After the death
of Clement IV., in 1268, the Holy
See was vacant longer than ever before,
viz., two years nine months
and two days, on account of the
dissensions of the eighteen cardinals
who composed the Sacred College.
The conclave was held at
Viterbo; but, although King Philip
III. of France and Charles I. of
Sicily went there to hasten the
election, and S. Bonaventure, general
of the Franciscans, induced the
towns-people to keep the fathers
close prisoners in the episcopal palace,
nothing availed, until the happy
thought struck Raniero Gatti,
captain of the city, to take off the
roof, so that the rain would pour
in on wet, and the sunshine on hot
days.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> This had the desired effect,
and after S. Philip Beniti, general
of the Servites, had refused the offer
of election, the cardinals promptly
agreed upon Theobald Visconti,
archdeacon of Liege, and apostolic
legate in Syria. It was on this occasion
that an episcopal quasi-poet
improvised the leonine verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Papatus munus tulit Archidiaconus unus,</div>
<div class="verse">Quem Patrem Patrum fecit discordia Fratrum.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>About this time it became customary
for the cardinals to act as
“protectors” of nations, religious
orders, universities, and other great
institutions, which were liable to
be brought into relations with the
Holy See more frequently then than
at present; but Urban VI., in 1378,
without absolutely prohibiting this
species of patrocination, forbade
cardinals to accept gifts or any kind
of remuneration from those whose
interests they guarded. Martin V.
in 1424, Alexander VI. in 1492,
and Leo X. in 1517, issued various
decrees to moderate or entirely
abolish such an use of their influence
by the cardinals for private parties,
because it might easily, under certain
circumstances, stand in the way
of that impartial counsel to the
pope and equity of action to which
they were bound before all things.
Yet it shows the immense importance
of the cardinalate in the
XIVth and XVth centuries, that
powerful sovereigns gave to individuals
in the Sacred College the
high-sounding title of protectors of
their kingdoms. At the present
day, cardinals are allowed to assume,
gratuitously, a care of the interests
of religious orders, academies, colleges,
confraternities, and other institutions,
mostly in Rome, which
may choose to pay them the compliment
of putting themselves under
their patronage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span></p>

<p>In the IXth century, S. Leo IV.
made a rule that the cardinals
should come to the apostolic palace
twice a week for consistory, and John
VIII., towards the end of the same
century, furthermore ordered them
to meet together twice a month to
treat of various affairs appertaining
to their office. We find here the
beginning of those later celebrated
assemblies called Roman Congregations,
which are permanent commissions
to examine, judge, and expedite
the affairs of the church
throughout the world. Each cardinal
is made a member of four or
more of these congregations, and a
cardinal is generally at the head&mdash;with
the name of prefect&mdash;of each
of those the presidency of which
the pope has not reserved to himself.
It is always from among the
cardinals that the highest officials
of the Church in Rome and of the
Sacred College are chosen. The
former are the palatine cardinals,
so called because they are lodged
in some one of the pontifical palaces
and enjoy the fullest share of the
sovereign’s confidence and favor.
They are at present four in number,
viz., the pro-datary, secretary of
briefs, of memorials, of state.
Next come the cardinal vicar,
grand penitentiary, chamberlain,
vice-chancellor, librarian. The cardinal-archpriests
are at the head
of the three great patriarchal basilicas
of S. John of Lateran, S. Mary
Major, and S. Peter. The officials
of the Sacred College number five,
who are all, except one, <i lang="la">ex-officio</i>;
these are: the dean, who is always
Bishop of Ostia and Velletri, is head
of the Sacred College, and represents
it on certain occasions of state,
as when he receives the first visit
of princes and ambassadors, and
expresses to the Holy Father any
sentiments that he and his colleagues
may wish to announce in a
body. The sub-dean supplies his
place when absent, or incapacitated
from whatever cause. The First
Priest and First Deacon, who were
anciently called the Priors of their
order, have precedence, other things
being equal, over those of the same
class, besides certain rights and
privileges of particular importance
during a vacancy of the See. The
chamberlain is appointed annually
in the first consistory held after
Christmas. His office is not so
venerable or so significant as the
others are in times of extraordinary
occurrences; but in days of peace
it is of the highest practical importance.
It was instituted under Leo
X., but received its present development
under Paul III., in 1546.
Each cardinal habitually residing
in Rome must serve in his turn, beginning
with the dean and ending
with the junior deacon. From this
arrangement it may be imagined
that few cardinals live long enough
in the dignity to have to assume
more than once the rather onerous
duties of the office.</p>

<p>The pope gives the chamberlain
possession in the same consistory
at which he has been named, by
handing him a violet silk purse
fringed with gold and containing
certain consistorial papers and the
little balls used by the cardinals to
vote with in the committees in
which they treat of their corporate
affairs. The principal duties of the
chamberlain are of a two-fold character:
as chancellor, to sign and
register all cardinalitial acts, and as
treasurer, to administer any property
that may be held in common by
the cardinals. He is assisted in his
office by a very high prelate, who is
secretary of the Sacred College and
consistory. The archives are in a
chamber of the Vatican palace assigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
for the purpose by Urban
VIII., in 1625. The chamberlain
is also charged to sing the Mass at
the solemn requiem of a cardinal
dying during his tenure of office,
and on November 5 for all deceased
cardinals. But if he be of
the order of deacons, even if he have
received the priesthood, he must invite
a cardinal of the higher order
to officiate. This anniversary was
established by Leo X. in 1517.</p>

<p>On account of the great antiquity
of the cardinalate, there are many
things of minor importance connected
with it that are buried in
the obscurity of ages. Such are
appellations of honor and distinctions
in dress; but all writers agree
that after the IXth century there
was a remarkable increase in what
we might call the accessories of this
great office. Passing over a decree
which Tamagna (who yet is an authority
on cardinalitial matters)
ascribes to the Emperor Constantine,
in which the cardinals of the Holy
Roman Church were put on the
same footing before the state with
senators and consuls, and received
other marks of imperial favor, it is
certain that during the Middle Ages
they were frequently called senators,
were styled individually <i lang="la">Dominus</i>,
and addressed as <i lang="la">Venerande
Pater</i>, as we learn from a memorandum
drawn up by a Roman canonist
in 1227. In the accounts of
the Sacred College from the beginning
of the XIVth century up to
the year 1378, the cardinals are called
<i lang="la">Reverendi Patres et Domini</i>. But
from this period they assumed the
superlative, and up to the whole
of the XVth century were styled
<i lang="la">Reverendissimi</i>.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Urban VIII., on
the 10th of June, 1630, gave them
the title of eminence, which was
not, however, unknown to the
early Middle Ages, when it was
given to certain great officers of
the Byzantine Empire in Italy.
Urban’s immediate successor, Innocent
X., forbade cardinals to
use any other designation than
that of cardinal, or title than
that of eminence, or to put any
crown, coronet, or crest above their
arms, which were to be overarched
by the hat alone. When Cardinal
de’ Medici read the decree, with
what was then in such a personage
considered exemplary submission,
he requested his friends and the
members of his household never to
call him highness any more, and
immediately had the grand-ducal
crown removed from wherever it
was blazoned. In course of time,
however, cardinals of imperial or
royal lineage were allowed to assume
a style expressive of their birth; thus
the last of the Stuarts, the Cardinal
Duke of York, etc., was always called
Royal Highness at Rome. The
pope writes to a cardinal-bishop as
“Our venerable brother,” but to a
cardinal-priest or deacon as “Our
beloved son”; and a cardinal writing
to the pope who has raised him
to the purple should add at the end
of his letter, after all the other formulas
of respectful conclusion, the
words, <i lang="la">et creatura</i>. Although the
cardinals hold a rank so exalted,
they are in many ways made to remember
their complete dependence
in ecclesiastical matters upon the
sovereign pontiff. There is a
peculiar act of homage due by them
to the pope, which is called <em>Obedience</em>,
and consists in going up publicly
one by one in stately procession,
with <i lang="la">cappa magna</i> of royal
ermine, and outspread trailing scarlet
robe, to kiss the ring after making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
a profound inclination to the
pontiff sitting on his throne. This
is surely the grandest sight of the
Sistine Chapel, and we have often
thought in seeing it what a good
reminder it was to those most eminent
spiritual princes that, how
great soever they might be, they
were after all but the rays of
a greater luminary without which
they would have no existence.
The obedience is done at Mass and
Vespers; but never twice on the
same day, nor in services for the
dead.</p>

<p>The color of a cardinal’s dress is
red, unless he belong to a religious
order, in which case he retains
that of his habit, but uses the
same form of dress as the others.
In 1245, Innocent IV. conferred
upon the cardinals at the first
Council of Lyons the famous
distinction of the red hat, which
is so peculiarly the ornament of
their rank that, in common parlance,
to “receive the hat” is the same as
to be raised to the cardinalate.
The special significance of the hat
is, that it is placed by the hands of
the pope himself upon the dome of
thought and seat of that intellect by
which the cardinal will give learned
and loyal counsel in the government
of the church; and its color
signifies that the wearer is prepared
to lose the last drop of his blood
rather than betray his trust. Our
readers will be reminded here of
that angry vaunt of Henry VIII.
about Fisher, Bishop of Rochester,
who was lying in prison because he
would not acknowledge the royal
supremacy in matters of religion.
When news came to England that
Paul III. had raised him to the purple,
the king exclaimed, “The
pope may send him the hat, but I
will take care that he have no head
to wear it on”; in fact, the bishop
was shortly afterwards beheaded.
This hat is now one of ceremony
only, and serves but twice: once,
when the cardinal receives it in
consistory, and next when it rests
upon the catafalque at his obsequies.
It is then suspended from the ceiling
of the chapel or aisle of the
church in which he may be buried.
The form is round, with a low crown
and wide, stiff rim, from the inside
of which hang fifteen tassels attached
in a triangle from one to five.
At the ceremony of giving the hat
the pope says, in Latin: “Receive
for the glory of Almighty God and
the adornment of the Holy Apostolic
See, this red hat, the sign of the
unequalled dignity of the cardinalate,
by which is declared that even
to death, by the shedding of thy
blood, thou shouldst show thyself
intrepid for the exaltation of the
blessed faith, for the peace and
tranquillity of the Christian people,
for the increase and prosperity of
the Holy Roman Church. In the
name of the Father ✠; and of the
Son ✠; and of the Holy ✠ Ghost.
Amen.” Paul II., in 1464, added
other red ornaments, and among
them the red <i lang="it">beretta</i> or cap to be
worn on ordinary occasions; but
cardinals belonging to religious
orders continued to use the hood
of their habit or a cap of the same
color, until Gregory XIV. made
them wear the red. This point of
costume is illustrated by an anecdote
which we have heard from an
eye-witness; it also shows that one
should not be sure of promotion&mdash;until
it comes.</p>

<p>Pope Gregory XVI. was a great
admirer of a certain abbot in Rome,
whose habit was white, and rumor
ran that he would certainly be
made a cardinal. Some time before
the next consistory, the pope,
with a considerable retinue&mdash;it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
thought significantly&mdash;went to visit
the monastery, the father of which
was this learned monk, and there refreshments
were served in the suite
of apartments called, in large Roman
convents, the cardinal’s rooms,
because reserved for the use of that
dignitary, should one be created belonging
to the order. When the trays
of delicious pyramidal ice-creams
were brought in, the pope deliberately
took the <em>white</em> one presented to
him on bended knee by a chamberlain
and handed it to the Lord Abbot
sitting beside and a little behind
him, then took a <em>red</em> one for himself.
No one, of course, began until Gregory
had tasted first, and while all
eyes were on him he took the top off
his own ice-cream, turned and put it
on his neighbor’s, saying with a
smile as he looked around him,
“How well, gentlemen, the red
<em>caps</em> the white!” Alas! the poor
abbot; he understood it as doubtless
was meant he should, but
he was foolish enough to act
upon it, and procure his scarlet
outfit. This came to the ears of
the pope, who was so displeased
that he scratched him off the list,
nor could any friends ever get him
reinstated; and it was only when
Cardinal Doria said that he was
positively wasting away with the
disappointment and mortification,
that the pope consented to make
him an archbishop <i lang="la">in partibus</i>.</p>

<p>In the greater chapels, in the
grand procession on Corpus Christi,
and on other occasions the cardinal-bishops
wear copes fastened by a
pectoral jewel called <em>Formale</em>, which
is of gold ornamented with three
pine cones of mother-of-pearl, the
priests (even though they may have
the episcopal character) wear chasubles,
and the deacons dalmatics,
but all use white <em>damask</em> mitres with
red fringes at the extremity of the
bands. In their Titles and Deaconries,
also elsewhere, when they officiate,
the cardinals have the use of
pontificals. The custom of wearing
mitres is said to have begun for
cardinals of the two lower orders
only in the XIth century. One of
the distinctive ornaments of a cardinal
is the gold ring set with a
sapphire, and engraved on the metal
surface of the inside with the arms
of the pope who has created him.
It is put on his finger by the Sovereign
Pontiff with these words, some
of which are omitted in the case of
deacons: “For the honor of Almighty
God, of the holy apostles
SS. Peter and Paul, and of the
blessed N. N. (naming the Title) we
commit unto thee the church of &mdash;&mdash;
(naming it), with its clergy, people,
and succursal chapels.” The actual
value of this ring is only twenty-five
dollars, but for many centuries
the newly-created cardinal has
been expected to give a large sum
of money for some pious purpose,
which was different under different
popes, but was perpetually allotted
by Gregory XV., in 1622, to the Sacred
Congregation for the Propagation
of the Faith. Students of the
Propaganda will remember the elegant
tablet and commemorative inscription
originally set up in the
college church, but now encased
in the wall near the library. For a
long time the sum was larger than at
present and was paid in gold, but
in consideration of the general
distress in the early part of this
century Pius VII. reduced it to six
hundred scudi of silver, equal to
about seven hundred and fifty dollars
of our paper money. The last cardinal
who gave the full amount before
the reduction was Della Somaglia, in
1795.</p>

<p>The Roman ceremonial shows
the singular importance of the cardinalate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
by the disposition ordered
to be made of its members even after
death. It is prescribed that
when life has departed a veil be
thrown over the face, and the body,
dressed in chasuble if bishop or
priest, otherwise in dalmatic, shall
lie in state.</p>

<p>The hat used in his creation must
be deposited at his feet, and after
his funeral be suspended over his
tomb. His body must be laid in a
cypress-wood coffin in presence of
a notary and his official family, a
member of which&mdash;the major-domo&mdash;lays
at his feet a little case containing
a scroll of parchment on
which has been written a brief account
of the more important events
of his life. Then the first coffin is
enclosed in another of lead, and the
two together in a third one of some
kind of precious wood, each coffin
having been sealed with the seals
of the dead cardinal and the living
notary. The body thus secured is
borne by night with funeral pomp
of carriages and torches and long
array of chanting friars to the
church of requiem, where it remains
until the day appointed for the
Mass, at which the cardinals and
pope are present, and the latter
gives the final absolution.</p>

<p>When carriages first came into
use in Italy, which was about the
year 1500, they were considered
effeminate and a species of refined
luxury, so much so that Pius IV.,
at a consistory held on November
27, 1564, in a grave discourse exhorted
the cardinals not to use a
means of conveyance fit only for
women, but to continue to come to
the palace in the virile manner that
had been so long the custom&mdash;that
is, on horseback; and reminded them
that when the Emperor Charles V.
returned into Spain from his visit
to Italy, he had said that no sight
pleased him there so much as the
magnificent cavalcade of the cardinals
on their way to the chapels
and consistories. After this they
always rode or were carried in litters
or sedan-chairs, until the beginning
of the XVIIth century, when
it became impossible any longer to
hinder them from using the new
and more convenient style which
had become general for all people
of means. Urban VIII., in 1625, by
ordering cardinals to put scarlet
head-gear on their horses, seemed
to sanction the change; but it appears
to have been abused, by some
at least, in a manner described by
Innocent X. (1676), in a pathetic
address, as ill becoming those who
had renounced the pomps and vanities
of the world. We may get an
idea of the ostentation, when we
know that but a few years previously
Maurice of Savoy (who afterwards
by permission renounced the cardinalate
for reasons of state) used
to go to the Vatican with a following
of two hundred splendid equipages
and a numerous escort of horsemen
in brilliant uniforms. The
modern custom (which has been
interrupted by the Italian usurpers)
is certainly very modest.</p>

<p>The cardinals proceed to the minor
functions with a single carriage
and two on gala days, but princes
by birth have three.</p>

<p>Each carriage is red, finished with
gilt ornaments, and drawn by a pair
of superb black horses from a particular
breed of the Campagna.
The scarlet umbrella carried by one
of the somnolent footmen behind
is seldom taken out of its cover,
being merely a reminiscence of the
old fashion when their eminences
rode, and it might be of service
against the rain or the sun.</p>

<p>Cardinals belonging to a religious
order of monks or friars who wear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
beards retain them after their exaltation;
but others must be clean
shaven. There have been considerable
changes in this matter, and
cardinals wore no beards in the
XVth century. In fact, the long,
silky, and well-cultivated beard of
Bessarion (a Greek) lost him the
election to the papacy after the
death of Nicholas V., in 1455. It
was also the occasion of his death
with chagrin at an atrocious insult
offered him by Louis XI. of France;
for being on an embassy to compose
the differences between that
monarch and the Duke of Burgundy,
he wrote to the latter stating
the object of his mission before
having made his visit to the former,
which so enraged that punctilious
king that when the legate came
the first thing he did was to pull his
magnificent beard and say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Barbara graeca genus retinent quod habere solebant.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Under the pontificate of Julius
II., who gave the example, cardinals
wore long beards; but in the
next century only mustaches and
<i lang="it">la barbetta</i> (the “goatee”)&mdash;varied
among the more rigid by just a little
bit beneath the under lip, and called
a <i lang="fr">mouche</i> by the French&mdash;were retained
until, in the year 1700, Clement
XI. introduced the perfectly
beardless face, which now shows itself
under the <i lang="it">beretta</i> (Cancellieri,
<cite>Possessi de’ Papi</cite>, page 327).</p>

<p>Not to mention S. Lawrence,
who is generally reckoned an archdeacon
(<i>i.e.</i>, cardinal first deacon)
of the Roman Church, or S. Jerome,
in vindication of whose cardinalate
Ciacconius wrote a special treatise
(Rome, 1581), the Sacred College
counts among its members fifteen
saints either canonized or beatified.
The first is S. Peter Damian, in
1058, and the last Blessed Pietro-Maria
Tommasi, in 1712. The
cardinals have the privilege of
a <i lang="la">Proprium</i> for these in the Office.
There are besides nine others popularly
venerated as Blessed, but
without warrant from the Holy
See that we are aware of. The
noblest families of Europe, imperial,
royal, and of lower rank, have
been represented in the Sacred
College, those of Italy, of course,
preponderating: and no other one,
we believe, has had so many cardinals
as that of Orsini, which
claims over forty-two, beginning
with Orsino, cardinal-priest A.D.
500. Yet merit has never been refused
a place among its members
because it made no “boast of heraldry”
or other pretension to social
superiority. Where so many have
been distinguished in a very high
degree, it is difficult to select half a
dozen names from as many different
nations that have been represented
in the Sacred College, and that stand
out above all the rest in their several
countries. Among the Germans,
Nicholas de Cusa, in 1448, is superior
to all others for his intrepid defence
of the Holy See and his immense
learning, especially in mathematics.
He discovered the annual revolution
of the earth around the sun
before Copernicus or Galileo were
born. Among the Spaniards, Ximenes,
in 1507, is easily chief, as a
minister of state and encourager of
education. In England, Wolsey,
created by Leo X., in 1515, although
Panvinius (<cite>Epitome</cite>, p. 377) insolently
calls him “the scum and
scandal of the human race,” is
the greatest figure, and needs no
praise. In Scotland, Beaton is
first as state minister and patron
of learning. He was put to
death in hatred of the faith which
could not be subverted while he
lived. Among the Italians, Bellarmine
may be placed first; certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
no other cardinal has filled
so often and so long the minds of
the adversaries of the faith. Clement
VIII., in 1599, when he created
him, said that there was no
one his equal for learning in all
the church. In France, Richelieu,
the greatest prime minister that
ever lived, and the savior of the
government and the church by effectually
putting down the rebellious
Huguenots. Everything that
is good and very little comparatively
that is bad has been represented
in the Sacred College; but
lest we should be thought to flatter
we will give a few examples
that show how no body of men is
entirely above reproach. Moroni
has a special article on pseudo-cardinals
and another on cardinals
who have been degraded from their
high and sacred office. We say
nothing of the former, or we would
be led into an interminable article
on the ambition, intrigue, and
schisms that have disgraced individuals
and injured the church.
Boniface VIII. was obliged to degrade
and excommunicate the two
turbulent Colonnas, uncle and
nephew; but doing penance under
his successor, they were restored.
Julius II. and Leo X. had difficulties
with some of their cardinals, and
one of them, Alfonso Petrucci, for
conspiring against the sovereign,
was decapitated in Castle Sant’
Angelo on July 6, 1517. Odet de
Coligni, who had been made a cardinal
very young at the earnest request
of Francis I., afterwards embraced
Calvinism, and, as usual with
apostates, embraced something else
besides. Although he had thrown
off his cassock, yet when Pius IV.
pronounced him degraded and excommunicated,
he resumed it, out
of contempt, long enough to get
married in his red robes. Cardinals
Charles Caraffa<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> and Nicholas
Coscia<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> in Italy; de Rohan<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> of
the Diamond Necklace affair, and de
Loménie de Brienne<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> in France, <em>if</em>,
on the one hand, they have not been
what we would expect from those
so highly honored, on the other,
they give us proofs of the impartial
justice of the popes, and that
no one in their eyes is above the
law. Among the curiosities of the
cardinalate is that of Ferdinand
Taverna, Bishop of Lodi, who was
raised to the purple in 1604, and
died of joy. This reminds us
that Cancellieri, with his usual singularity
of research, has a passage
in his work on the <cite>Enthronement of
the Popes</cite>, about “persons who have
gone mad or died of grief because
they were not made cardinals,” and
tells of one in particular who hoped
to make his way by his reputation for
learning, and had a little red hat
hung up above his desk to keep
himself perpetually in mind of the
prize he was ambitiously seeking&mdash;and,
of course, never found. Poor
human nature! The importance
of the telegraph as a means of
avoiding inconvenient nominations
is shown by a good many cases of
men elevated to the cardinalate
when they were already dead.
Three occurred in the XIVth century;
but as late as 1770 Paul de
Carvalho, brother of the infamous
Pombal, was published (having been
reserved <i lang="la">in petto</i>) on January 20,
three days after he had expired.</p>

<p>The Orsini are noted for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
longevity, and it has shown itself in
the cardinals as well as in others of
the family. Giacinto Bobò Orsini
was made a cardinal at twenty by
Honorius II., and after living
through sixty-five years of his dignity
and eleven pontificates, was
himself elected pope (being only
a deacon) at the age of eighty-five,
and reigned for nearly seven
years as Celestine III. (1191-1198).
Another one, Pietro Orsini,
after having three times refused
the honor, was at length induced to
accept it, wore the purple for fifty-four
years and finally became Benedict
XIII. (1724-1730).</p>

<p>Gregory XI., who brought back
the See from Avignon, was made a
cardinal by his uncle at seventeen;
Paul II. by his, at twenty-one; Pius
III. by his, at twenty; and Leo X.
by his, at fourteen&mdash;but not allowed
to wear his robes until three
years later. The last example, we
believe, of a very young cardinal is
that of a Spanish Bourbon, Don Luis,
created at twenty-three by Pius VII.,
in 1810; he was permitted afterwards
to renounce it. Although exceptions
may occasionally be made in
future, a mature age has for many
pontificates come to be considered
absolutely necessary before being
raised to the dignity. Artaud de
Montor has an anecdote in his <cite>Life
of Pius VIII.</cite>, about the inexorable
Leo XII. in connection with the
young Abbé Duc de Rohan-Chabot,
a Montmorency, and as such, one
would think, quite the equal of an
Orsini, Colonna, or the son of any
other great Italian family. Whenever
Leo was pressed on the subject,
and he was urged by many and very
influential persons, to confer the
dignity upon the princely, learned,
and virtuous priest, he had a new
Latin verse ready in praise of him,
but always ending with his inevitable
youth, as this one for example:
Sunt mores, doctrina, genus&mdash;sed
deficit ætas (<cite>Artaud</cite>, i. p. 205).
He was thirty-seven at the time.</p>

<p>We conclude with a few words
the bibliography of the cardinalate.
Not to mention the almost innumerable
separate lives of cardinals
which have been published in
all countries, particularly Italy,
the greatest work or series of works
connected with the subject is undoubtedly
that of the Spanish Dominican,
Chacon, who wrote a <cite>History
of the Popes and Cardinals</cite> up
to Clement VIII. His work was
corrected and continued by the
Italian Jesuit, Oldoini, up to Clement
IX. inclusive, all with beautiful
portraits and arms. At the request
of Benedict XIV., a learned
prelate named Guarnacci continued
this work to the pontificate
of Clement XII. inclusive. It was
sumptuously brought out in 1751.
There is a continuation of this, containing
the whole of Benedict XIV.’s
pontificate, and later matter from
MSS. left by Guarnacci and from
other sources, that appeared in
1787, and is actually (if our memory
does not deceive us) rarer at Rome
than the other parts of the work, although
published so much later.
We have understood that there are
still some precious MS. collections
on the same subject in the possession
of the noble Del Cinque family,
which are probably waiting for a
Mæcenas to accept the dedication
before being published. These are
the full titles of the works referred
to:</p>

<span class="smaller">WE ALL MEET TO PART.</span></h4>

<p>A second time I recovered. I
was still in the same place, and the
same hand was supporting me.
Some brandy was forced down my
throat, and it revived me.</p>

<p>“Now listen,” he said. “I have
good news for you. Why, the man
is going off again! Here, Roger,
take another nip. So. Now you
are much nearer being a dead man
than your father, only you will not
let me tell you quietly. Hush,
now! Not a word, or I am dumb.
You lie still and listen, and let me
talk. Everything is well here. That
is about as much information as you
can bear at present. There is
nothing the matter with anybody,
except with yourself. Miss Herbert,
in consequence of a lucky
little telegram received this afternoon
commissioned me to await
your arrival here, and tell you just
that much. Everything else was to
be explained at the Grange, where
your father and some friends are
waiting to receive with open arms
the returned prodigal. This much
I may add: Your father has been
ill, very ill. But he has recovered.
Now, another nip and I think we
may be moving. That was Sir
Roger at whose feet you fell outside.
The noble old veteran never
moved a foot, or your brains might
have been dashed out. He is a
truer friend than I, Roger, for he
knew you at once, pricked up his
ears, bent down his head towards
you, and gave a low whinny that
told me the whole story in a second.
I’ll be bound you have had nothing
to eat all day. That is bad. Why,
you are the sick man after all. Do
you feel equal to moving now?
Well, come: easy&mdash;in&mdash;hold this
skin up to your chin&mdash;so! And
now we are off. Mr. Roger Herbert,
I wish you a very merry
Christmas!”</p>

<p>I sat silent with that delicious
sense of relief after a great danger
averted while the shadow of that
danger has not quite passed away.
Kenneth did all the talking.
The snowfall had ceased and the
moon was up. How well I remembered
every house we passed, as
the cheery lights flashed out of the
windows, and the sounds of merry
voices, whose owners I could almost
name, broke on my ear. Leighstone
seemed fairy-land, which I
had reached after long wanderings
through stony deserts and over
barren seas. There is the old
Priory, rising dark and solemn out of
the white snow, with the white gravestones
standing mute at the head
of white graves all around it. The
moonlight falls full on the family
tomb. I shuddered as I looked upon
it, not yet quite assured that it is
not open for another occupant. I can
see the frozen figure of Sir Roger
stiff and stark with his winter grave-clothes
upon him as we roll by the
Priory gates. And there, at last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
are the gleaming windows of the
Grange, and the faint feeling again
steals over my heart.</p>

<p>The heavy snowfall deadens the
sound of the wheels, and we are
within the house before our arrival
is known. Miss Herbert is called
out quietly by a servant, a stranger
to me. Dear hearts! What these
women are! She does not cry out,
she does not speak a word; watching
and suffering had made her so
wise. She clings to me, and weeps
silently on my breast a long while,
smothering even the sobs that
threaten to break her heart. When
at last we look around for Kenneth
he is nowhere to be seen, but there
is a strange hush over all the house,
and the voices that I heard on my
entrance are silent.</p>

<p>“Papa is alone in the study&mdash;waiting,”
whispered Nellie. “I
received your telegram. O Roger!
that little scrap of paper was like a
message from heaven. He is growing
anxious, but expects you. Hush!
follow me.”</p>

<p>She stole along on tiptoe, and I
after her. The door of the study
was ajar. She opened it softly, and,
standing in the shadow, I peeped
in. He was seated in an easy-chair
and had dozed off. His face wore
that gentle, languid air of one who
has been very ill and is slowly recovering;
of one who has looked
death in the face and to whom life
is still new and uncertain. Ten
years seemed to have been added
to his life. Whether owing to his
illness or to some other cause, I
could not tell, but it seemed to me
that a certain look of firmness and
resolve, that was at times too prominent,
had quite disappeared. Instead
of his own brown locks he
wore a wig. He had suffered very
much. The door creaked as Nellie
entered, disturbing but not awakening
him. He sighed, his lips moved,
and I thought he muttered my
name.</p>

<p>“Papa!” said Nellie, touching
his arm lightly. How matronly the
Fairy looked! “Papa!”</p>

<p>“Ah! Yes, my dear. Is that
you, my child? Is&mdash;is nobody
with you?” What a wistful look in
the eyes at that last question!</p>

<p>“Do you feel any better, papa?
It is time to take your medicine.”
How slow the demure minx is
about it.</p>

<p>“Is it? I don’t think I will take
any now. I want nothing just now,
my darling.”</p>

<p>“What&mdash;no medicine! Nothing
at all, papa?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all. Is not that
train arrived yet?” he asked, looking
around anxiously at the clock.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I think so, papa. And it
brought such a lot of visitors.”</p>

<p>“Any&mdash;any&mdash;for us, Nellie?” He
coughed, and his voice trembled
into a feeble old treble as he asked
this question.</p>

<p>“Only one, papa. May he come
in?”</p>

<p>He knew all in an instant. He
rose and tottered towards the door,
where he would have fallen had
I not caught him in my arms.
Only one word escaped him.</p>

<p>“Roger!”</p>

<p>After some time Kenneth stole
in, and seeing how matters stood insisted
on bearing me off to dinner.
He took me into the parlor, which
was blazing with lights and decorated
with holly and red berries in
good old Christmas fashion. The
first object to meet my eyes was a
great “Welcome Home” which
flashed in letters of fragrant blossoms
cunningly woven in strange
device about my portrait. Mrs.
Goodal came forward and kissed
me while the tears fell from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
eyes. “You don’t deserve it, you
wicked boy, but I can’t help it,”
she said. Mr. Goodal had seized
both my hands in his. A beautiful
girl stood a little apart watching
all with wondering eyes, and in
them too there were tears, such is
the force of example with women.
I had never seen her before, but I
needed no ghost to tell me that she
was Kenneth’s sister.</p>

<p>“This is Elfie, Roger,” said
Fairy. “She wants to welcome
you too. Elfie is my sister. I
stole her. Oh! a sister is so much
nicer than a great rough brother
who runs away!”</p>

<p>“And this,” said Mrs. Goodal,
leading forward a tall, spare gentleman,
with that closely shaven face
and quiet lip and eye that, with or
without the conventional garb,
stamp the Catholic priest all the
world over&mdash;“this is our dear
friend and father, the friend and father
of all of us, Father Fenton.”</p>

<p>There was a general pause at this
introduction. I suppose that my
countenance must have shown some
perplexity, for a general laugh followed
the pause. Mrs. Goodal
came to the rescue.</p>

<p>“You expected to meet Mr.
Knowles, I suppose, sir, or the Abbot
Jones. Kenneth has told me
about the Abbot Jones. But you
must know that the present Archdeacon
Knowles is far too high and
mighty a dignitary for Leighstone,
and the abbot is laid up with the
gout. Your father has not been to
the Priory for a very long time&mdash;for
so long a time that he thinks he
would no longer be known there.
The Herbert pew is very vacant;
and Nellie has had no one to take
her. Still mystified? You see
what comes of silly boys running
away from home and never writing.
They miss all the news.”</p>

<p>She led me to the other end of
the parlor, and I stood before a
lofty ivory crucifix. The light of
tapers flashed upon the thin pale
face; blood gleamed from the
nailed hands and feet, from the
pierced side, from the bowed and
thorn-crowned head. It was the
figure of “the Man of Sorrows,”
and the artist had thrown into the
silent agony of the face an expression
of infinite pity. My own heart
bowed in silence.</p>

<p>“We are all Papists, Roger.
What are you?” whispered Mrs.
Goodal at my elbow.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” I murmured. “Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Nothing yet,” she whispered
again. “But do you think that we
have all been praying to <em>Him</em> all
this time for <em>nothing</em>?”</p>

<p>“And my father?”</p>

<p>“The most inveterate Papist of
us all!”</p>

<p>There was a tone of triumph in
her voice that was almost amusing.</p>

<p>“How did it all come about?”</p>

<p>“She did it,” broke in Kenneth,
pointing to his mother. “Did I
not tell you that she was the sweetest
woman to have her own way?
If I were a heretic, I would sooner
face the Grand Inquisitor himself
than this most amiable of women.
Set a thief to catch a thief, Roger.
But come; heretics don’t abstain as
do wicked creatures like these ladies.
I forget, they do, though; and
my heretic, fair ladies, has had nothing
to eat all day; so I insist upon
not another word until the fatted
calf is disposed of by our returned
prodigal.”</p>

<p>That was a merry Christmas eve.
We all nestled together, and bit by
bit the whole story came out. On
the receipt of my first letter, after
a fruitless inquiry for me, Kenneth
and his mother posted down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
Leighstone. Their arrival was most
opportune; for my father, on hearing
of my departure, suffered a relapse
that laid him quite prostrate.
Poor Nellie was in despair, brave
heart though she was. By unremitting
care he was partially restored,
and then followed the long dreary
months and the weary waiting, day
after day, for some scrap of news
from me. In such cases, the worst
is generally dreaded save when the
worst actually takes place, and my
father drooped gradually. He was
prevailed upon to pay a visit to the
Goodals, and there it was that his
heart, pierced with affliction, and
bowed down with sorrow, opened to
the holier and higher consolation
that religion only affords. Father
Fenton, who was invalided from a
severe course of missionary labors,
was staying with them, and the intercourse
thus begun developed into
what we have seen. On his return
to Leighstone, the silent house
opened up the bitter poignancy of
his grief. Every familiar object on
which his eye rested only served to
remind him of one who had passed
away; whom he accused himself of
having driven away by an order
that he could only now regard with
abhorrence. A cold, something
slight, seized him, and soon appeared
alarming symptoms. In view
of the recent changes, Nellie knew
not to whom of our relatives to apply
in this emergency, and could
only write to Mrs. Goodal, who flew
to her assistance. The arrival of
my letter brought down Kenneth,
“like a madman,” his mother said.
The letter arrived just at the crisis
of the fever in which my father lay;
the good news was imparted to him
in one of his lucid intervals, and
the crisis took a favorable turn.
The Christmas holy-days brought
Elfie from her convent; and finally
all came together, awaiting my expected
return. How that letter
had been kissed, petted, wept over,
laughed over, spelt out inch by
inch! I wonder that a fragment
of it remained; but even had it
been worn to dust by reverent fingers,
it would not have mattered:
the women knew every word of it
by heart. It formed the staple topic
of conversation whenever they
met. There never yet was such a
letter written, and the idea that the
writer of it should only receive ten
dollars&mdash;how much money was ten
dollars?&mdash;a week was proof positive
that the American people did not
appreciate true genius when it found
its way among them. Mr. Culpepper,
indeed! Who cared what he
would think? The idea of a person
of the name of Culpepper having
to do with men of genius! They
wondered how I could consent to
write for such a person at all. And
Mrs. Jinks! Good gracious! that
dreadful Mrs. Jinks and her “littery
gents”; Mrs. Jinks and the
beefsteak; Mrs. Jinks and the pork
chops; Mrs. Jinks and her “mock
turtle” soup; Mrs. Jinks and “her
Jane,” etc. etc. Poor old Roger!
Poor, dear boy! How miserable
it made them all, and yet how absurdly
ridiculous it all was. It
made them laugh and cry in the
same breath.</p>

<p>What a hero I had become!
What was all my fancied triumph
to this? What is all the success
one can win in this world to the
genuine love and the foolish adoration
of the two or three hearts that
made up our little world before we
knew that great wide open beyond
the boundary of our own quiet garden?
And all this fuss and affection
was poured out over me, who
had run away from it, and thought
of it so little while I was away. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
was, speaking reverently, like the
precious ointment in the alabaster
vase, broken and poured out over
me, in the fond waste of love.
Why, indeed, was this waste for
me? This ointment was precious,
and might have been sold for many
pence and given to the poor&mdash;the
poor of this great world, who were
hungering and thirsting after just
such love as this, that we who have
it accept so placidly, and let it run
and diffuse itself over us, and take
no care, for is not the source from
which it comes inexhaustible, as the
widow’s cruse of oil? But so it is,
and so it will continue to be while
human nature remains truly human
nature. The good shepherd, leaving
the ninety-nine sheep, will go after
the one which was lost, and finding
him, bear him on his own travel-weary
and travel-worn shoulders in
triumph home. The father will kill
the fatted calf for the prodigal
who has lived riotously and
wasted his inheritance, but the
faint cry of whose repentant anguish
is heard from afar off. The
mother’s heart will go out after the
scapegrace son who is tramping the
world alone, turned out of doors
for misbehavior; and all the joy
she feels in the good ones near her
is as nothing compared with the
thought that <em>he</em> at last has come
back, sad and sorrowful and forlorn,
to the home he left long ago, in
the brightness of the morning, with
so gay a step and so light a
heart. It is unjust, frightfully
unjust, that it should be so. Did
not the good son so feel it, and
was his protest not right? Did
not the laborers in the vineyard so
find it when those who came at
the eleventh hour, and had borne
naught of the heat and the burden
of the day, received the same reward
as they? And who shall say
that the laborers were not right
and the lord of the vineyard unjust?
What trades-union could
ever take into consideration such
reasoning as this, forbidden by the
very book of arithmetic? Wait
awhile, friends. Some day when
we, who now feel so keenly the injustice
of it all, are fathers and
mothers, let us put the question
then to ourselves: “Why
this waste of precious ointment on
one who values it not? I will seal
up the alabaster jar, let the ointment
harden into stone, and no
sweetness shall flow out of it.” Do
so&mdash;if you can, and the world will
be a very barren place. It would
dry and shrivel up under arid justice.
Did not the Master tell us
so? Did he not say that he came
to call not the just but sinners to repentance?
And is it not this very injustice
that makes earth likest heaven,
where we are told there shall
be more joy over one sinner doing
penance than over the ninety-nine
just who need not penance?</p>

<p>And here am I preaching, instead
of spending my Christmas merrily
like a man. But the thought of all
this affection wasted on so callous
a wretch as I had proved myself to
be, was too tempting to let pass.
Suddenly the chimes rang out
from the old steeples, and we were
silent, listening with softened hearts
and moistening eyes.</p>

<p>“There is another surprise for
you yet,” said Mrs. Goodal, mysteriously.
“Come, I want to show
you your room.”</p>

<p>She took me upstairs, paused a
moment at the door to whisper:
“It has another Occupant now,
Kenneth. Go in and visit him,”
opened the door and pushed me
gently in.</p>

<p>The room was lighted only by a
little lamp, through which a low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
flame burned with a rosy glow. The
flame flickered and shone on an
altar with a small tabernacle, before
which Father Fenton was kneeling
in silent prayer. My old room had
been converted into a chapel, and
there they had knelt and prayed
for me. Presently the chapel was
lighted up, and my father was assisted
to a chair that had been prepared
for him. Mr. Goodal took
up his position near a harmonium,
in one corner, while I retired into
the other. One or two of the household
came in and took their places
quietly. Father Fenton rose up,
and, assisted by Kenneth, vested
himself, and the midnight Mass
began. Soon the harmonium was
heard, and then in tones that trembled
at first, but in a moment cleared
and grew firm and strong and
glorious, Elfie, laughing Elfie, who
now seemed transformed into one
of those angels who brought the
glad tidings long, long ago, burst
forth into the <cite>Adeste Fideles</cite>.</p>

<p>All present joined in the refrain,
Nellie’s sweet voice mingling with
the strong, manly tones of Kenneth.
I saw his face light up as a soldier’s
of old might at a battle cry. How
happy are the earnest!</p>

<p>Before the Mass was ended, Father
Fenton turned and spoke a
few words:</p>

<p>“One of old said, ‘When two or
three are gathered together in my
name, there am I in the midst of
them.’ I need not point out to
you the solemn manner in which a
few moments since he who made
that promise fulfilled it, for he has
spoken to your own hearts. But
I would call your attention to
the wonderful and special manner
in which Christ has visited and
blessed the two or three gathered
together here this night in his
name. We are here like the shepherds
of old, come to adore the
Christ born in a manger. One by
one have we dropped in, taken in
hand and led gently, as though by the
Lord himself. This great grace has
not been given us for nothing. It
has been the answer to fervent, earnest,
and unceasing prayer, which,
though it may sometimes seem to
knock at the gates of heaven a long
while in vain, has been heard all
the while, and at length, entering in,
falls back on our hearts laden with
gifts and with graces. The two or
three have increased now by one,
now by another, and under Providence
are destined to increase until
the Master calls them away unto
himself. Happy is the one who
comes himself to Christ, thrice happy
he who helps to lead another!
He it is who answers that bitter
cry of anguish that rang out from
the darkness and the suffering of
Calvary&mdash;‘I thirst.’ He holds up
the chalice to the lips of the dying
Saviour filled with the virtues of a
saved soul. It was for souls Christ
thirsted, and he gives him to drink.
But when a conversion is wrought,
when a stray sheep is brought into
the fold, the work is only begun.
All the debt is not paid. It is well
to be filled with gratitude for the
wonderful favor of God in bringing
us out of the land of Egypt and the
house of bondage into the land
flowing with milk and honey, where
the good shepherd attends his
sheep, where we draw water from
the living fountain. We have left
behind us the fleshpots of Egypt.
But there is ingratitude to be remembered
and wiped out. Many
weary years have we wandered in
desert places seeking rest and finding
none. Yet the voice of the
shepherd was calling to us all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
while. Peace, peace, peace! Peace
to men of good-will has been ringing
out of the heavens over the
mountains of this world these long
centuries, yet how many ears are
deaf to the angels’ song! The star
in the East has arisen, has moved
in the heavens, and stood over his
cradle&mdash;the star of light and of
knowledge&mdash;yet how many eyes
have been blind to its lustre and
its meaning. It is because it points
to a lowly place. In Bethlehem
of Judæa Christ is born, not in the
city of the king; in a stable, not in
the palace of Herod; in a manger
he is laid, wrapped in swaddling-clothes,
not in the purple of royalty.
He is lowly; we would be
great. He is meek; we would be
proud. He is a little innocent child;
we would be wise among the
children of men. The birth-place
of Christianity is humility. We
must begin there, low down, for he
himself has said it: ‘Suffer little
children to come unto me’; ‘Unless
ye become as one of these little
ones, ye shall not enter the kingdom
of heaven.’</p>

<p>“My brethren, my dear children,
little flock whom Christ
has visited really and truly in
his body and blood, soul and divinity,
this is our lesson&mdash;to be
humble as he is. In this was his
church founded on this memorable
night, at this solemn hour, while
day and night are in conflict. The
day dawned on the new birth and
the night was left for ever behind.
There is no longer excuse for being
children of the darkness, for the
light of the world has dawned at
length. It dawned in lowliness,
poverty, suffering&mdash;these are its
surroundings. Christ’s first worshippers
on this earth were the one
who bore him and her spouse,
Joseph the carpenter. His second,
the poor shepherds, whose watchful
ears heard first the song of peace.
The kings from afar off followed
who were looking and praying for
light from heaven, and it came.
The angels guided the ignorant
shepherds to where he lay; but
of those to whom more was given,
more was expected. The gifts of
intellect, learning, and the spirit of
inquiry are gifts of God, not of
man, or of Satan. They are to be
used for God, not sharpened against
him. Happy are those to whom he
has given them, who, like the Kings
of the East, though far away from
the lowly place where he lies,
hearken to the voice of God calling
to them over the wildernesses that
intervene, and make answer to the
divine call. Search in the right
spirit&mdash;search in the spirit of humility,
and honesty, and truth. To
them will the star of Truth appear
to guide them aright over many
dangers and difficulties, and disasters
mayhap, to the stable where
Christ is sleeping, to lay at his feet
the gifts and offerings he gave them&mdash;the
gold of faith, the frankincense
of hope, the myrrh of charity.”</p>

<p>I suppose it is intended that sermons
should apply to all who hear
them. That being the case, how
could Father Fenton’s words apply
to me? There was not a single
direct allusion to me throughout.
What he said might apply equally
to all, and yet surely of all there I
was the most guilty. I alone did
not adore; and why? After all, was
humility the birthplace of Christianity?
But was not I humble as
the rest of them? “You! who are
so fond of mounting those stilts,”
whispered Roger Herbert senior&mdash;“you,
who spend your days and
nights dreaming of the <i lang="la">divinus afflatus</i>&mdash;you,
who would give half your
life, were it yours to give, to convert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
those little stilts into a genuine
monument, and for what purpose?
That men might point and look up at
the dizzy height and say, Behold
Roger Herbert, the mighty, his feet
on earth, his head among the gods
of heaven!” And was it true that
Truth had been speaking all this
time, all these centuries, to so little
purpose? Why was it? how could
it be if the voice was divine? “The
devil, the world, and the flesh,
Roger; forget not the devil, the
world, and the flesh. Were there
only truth, we should all be of one
mind; but unfortunately, truth is
confronted with falsehood.” What
is truth&mdash;what is truth? Ay, the
old agony of the world. One alone
of all that world dared to tell us
that he was the Truth, he was the
Way, he was the Life. “Let us find
him, Roger. Father Fenton says
he is in the midst of those gathered
together in his name.”</p>

<p>Christmas passed, and a New
Year dawned on us&mdash;a happy new
year to all except myself. I was
the only unhappy being at the
Grange. Elfie went back to her
convent school. My father’s health
was on the high road to restoration,
and the growing attachment between
Kenneth and Nellie was evident
even to my purblind vision. Strange
to say, I did not like to talk to Kenneth
as openly as at first about my
doubts and difficulties, and Father
Fenton’s company, when alone, I
avoided, although he was the most
amiable of men, gifted with wit
softened by piety, and a learning
that not even his modesty could
conceal. He must have observed
how studiously I shunned him, for,
after seeking ineffectually once or
twice to draw me into serious conversation,
he refrained, and only
spoke on ordinary topics. I began
to grow restless again.</p>

<p>The season had advanced into
an early spring; the green was already
abroad and the birds beginning
to come, when one afternoon,
that seemed to have strayed out of
summer, so soft and balmy was the
air, Nellie and I sat together out
on the lawn as in the old days.
My father was taking a nap within;
the Goodals had driven to Gnaresbridge
to meet a friend whom they
expected to pass by the up-town
train to London. Nellie was working
at something, and I was musing
in silence. Suddenly she said:</p>

<p>“Roger, do you remember the
promises you made me the night
before you ran away?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Fairy.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir?”</p>

<p>“Well, madam?”</p>

<p>“Is that all?”</p>

<p>“Is what all?”</p>

<p>“Do you only remember your
promise?”</p>

<p>“Is not that a great deal?”</p>

<p>“No; unless you have kept it.”</p>

<p>“Ah&mdash;h&mdash;h!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by ah&mdash;h?”</p>

<p>“What did I promise?”</p>

<p>“That from that day forward
you would not only try not to do
harm, but to do some good for
others as well as for yourself.”</p>

<p>“That is a very big promise.”</p>

<p>“No bigger now than it was
then.”</p>

<p>“But it means more now than it
did then.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit, not a bit, not a bit!”</p>

<p>“Things look to me so differently
now. One grows so much older
in a year sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Then you have not kept your
promise? O Roger!”</p>

<p>“Good, though you can spell it
in four letters, is a very large word,
Nellie, and means so much; and
others mean so many. Not to do
much harm is one thing; but to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
good, not once in a while, but to
be constant in it&mdash;that is another
thing, Nellie, and that was what I
promised. That promise I cannot
say I have kept.”</p>

<p>Nellie bent her head lower over
her work, and I believe I saw some
tears fall, but she said nothing. I
went on:</p>

<p>“Now Kenneth does good.”</p>

<p>There was no mistake about the
tears this time, although the head
bent a little lower still. “Kenneth
does a great deal of good. He
goes about among the poor as
regularly as a physician, and whatever
his medicine may be it seems
to do them more good than any
they can get at the druggist’s. He
has sent I don’t know how many
youngsters off to school, where he
pays for them. In fact, he seems
to me to be always scheming and
thinking about others and never
dreaming of himself, whereas I am
always scheming and thinking about
myself and never seem to see anybody
else in the world. Why, what
are you doing with that stuff in
your hands, Nellie? You are sewing
it anyhow.”</p>

<p>“O Roger! You&mdash;you&mdash;” she
could say no more, but hid her face,
that was rosy and pure as the dawn,
on my breast.</p>

<p>“A very pretty picture,” said a
deep voice behind us, and Nellie
started away from me, while all the
blood rushed back to her heart.
She was so white that Kenneth&mdash;for
it was he who had stolen up unobserved
at the moment&mdash;was
frightened, and said:</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Miss Herbert, if I
have startled you. I have only this
instant come, and quite forgot that
the grass silenced the sound of my
footsteps. Take this chair&mdash;shall I
bring a glass of water?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you; I am better
now. It was only a moment. We
did not hear you.”</p>

<p>“May I join you, then? Or was
it a <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>?”</p>

<p>“No; sit down, Kenneth. The
fact is, we were just discussing the
character of an awful scamp.”</p>

<p>“Who arrived just too late to
hear any evil of himself&mdash;is that
it?”</p>

<p>“No, he was here all the time,”
said Nellie, laughing, and herself
again.</p>

<p>“But what brings you from
Gnaresbridge so soon, Kenneth,
and all alone? Where have you
left Mr. and Mrs. Goodal?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Goodal had some shopping
to do at Gnaresbridge, and Mr.
Goodal, as in duty bound, waited
patiently the results of that interesting
operation. His patience makes
me blush for mine. The shopping
is such a very extensive operation
that I preferred a walk back, and
even now you see I have arrived
before them.”</p>

<p>“How very ungallant, Mr. Goodal!
I am surprised at you. I thought
Roger was the only gentleman who
didn’t like shopping.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I am quite
fond of it. I used to do all my
own shopping in New York. I got
Mrs. Jinks to buy me some things
once, but as she, woman-like, measured
everybody by Mr. Jinks, the
articles, though an excellent fit for
him, were an abomination on me.”</p>

<p>“And what did you do with
them?”</p>

<p>“What could I do with them?
Gave them to Mrs. Jinks, of course,
and for the future did my own
shopping. Indeed, I am getting
quite lazy here. There is nothing
for a fellow to do&mdash;is there, Kenneth?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of that as I came
along.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thinking of what?”</p>

<p>“The great puzzle&mdash;What to do.
I put it in every imaginable form.
The question was this: ‘Kenneth
Goodal, what are you going to do
with yourself?’ and the whole
eight miles passed before I could
arrive at anything like a satisfactory
conclusion. I finally resolved
to leave the question to arbitration,
and get others to decide for me. I
have already applied to one.”</p>

<p>He paused, and his gaze was fixed
on the ground. His face was
flushed, and his broad brow knitted
as though trying to find the right
clue to a puzzling query. I glanced
at Nellie, and observed that her
face had whitened again, while her
eyes were also bent upon the ground,
and her breath came and went
painfully.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he went on without raising
his head&mdash;Nellie was seated between
us&mdash;“I determined to leave
my case to arbitration. Your father
was one of the arbiters; you were
to be another, Roger; and a certain
young lady was to be a third. I
had intended to attack the members
of this high court of arbitration
singly; but as I find two of them
here together, I see no reason why
I should not receive my verdict at
once.. ..”</p>

<p>A further report of this most important
and interesting case it is
not for me to give, inasmuch as I
was not present. I saw at once
that the decision rested now with
the third arbiter, and that my opinion
was practically valueless in the
matter. How the case proceeded
I cannot tell. Thinking that there
was little for me to do, and how
deeply engaged were the other two
parties, I took advantage of the
noiseless grass to slink away without
attracting the attention of either,
heartily ashamed of myself for being
so persistent an intruder where
it was clear I was not particularly
wanted. It was a lovely evening,
and I took a long quiet ramble all
by myself. How much longer the
court was in session I do not know,
I only know that it was broken up
before I entered, just in time for
dinner. I noticed that in my father’s
eyes there was a softer look
than usual; that Mrs. Goodal took
Nellie’s place at table, opposite to
my father; that Mr. Goodal and
myself were neighbors, while opposite
to us sat the adjourned court
of arbitration, looking&mdash;looking as
young persons look only once in
their lives. There was a rather
awkward silence on my entrance,
which I found so unpleasant that I
rattled away all through dinner. I
must have been excellent company
for once in my life; for though at
this moment I do not recollect a
single sentence that I uttered, there
was so much laughter throughout
the dinner, laughter that grew and
grew until we found ourselves all
talking at length, all joining in, all
joking, all so merry that we were
astounded to find how the evening
had passed. My father looked
quite young again.</p>

<p>As I was retiring to my own room
for the night, Nellie caught me, put
both her arms around my neck, and
looked up into my eyes a long time
without saying a word, until at last
she seemed to find in them something
she was looking for, and when,
kissing her, I asked if I should blow
the candle out again, as I did on a
former memorable confession, she
flew away, her face lost amid blushes,
laughter, and tears. I was congratulating
myself on seeing an end
to a long day, when a guilty tap
came to my door, and Kenneth
stole in with the air of a burglar
who purposed making for the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
valuable he could lay hands on, and
vanishing with it through the window.
He closed the door as cautiously
as though a policeman, whom
he feared to disturb, was napping
without, and sat down without saying
a word. I looked at the ceiling;
he sat and stared at me. In
his turn, he began examining my
eyes. I could bear it no longer,
but burst out laughing, and held out
my hand, which he almost crushed
in his.</p>

<p>“You are as true a knight as ever
was old Sir Roger,” said Kenneth,
wringing my hand till I cried out
with pain. “I went on talking for
I don’t know how long, and saying
I forget now what, but, on looking
up, I found there was only one
listener. Well, we did without
you.”</p>

<p>“So now you know what to do
with yourself. Happy man! What
a pity Elfie is only fourteen! She
might tell me what to do with Roger
Herbert.”</p>

<p>I saw the two who, after my father,
I loved the best in all the world
made one. I waited until they returned
from the bridal trip, by which
time my father was fully restored
to health. We spent that season in
London, and when it was over returned
to Leighstone. The brown
hand of autumn was touching the
woods, when one morning I began
packing my trunk again, and that
same evening ate my last dinner at
the Grange. It was not a pleasant
dinner. The ladies were in tears
at times, and the gentlemen were
inclined to be taciturn. I did my
best to rally the party as on a former
occasion, but the effort was not
very successful.</p>

<p>“Oh! you are all Sybarites here,”
was my closing rejoinder to all
queries, tears, and complaints;
“and I should never do anything
among you. Not so fortunate as
Kenneth, who has found some one
to tell him what to do with himself,
I am driven back on my own resources,
and must work out that
interesting problem for myself. I
was advancing in that direction
when called away. I go back to
resume my labors in the old way.
You cannot realize the delicious
feeling that comes over one at times
who is struggling all alone, and
groping in the darkness towards a
great light that he sees afar off and
hopes to reach. I leave my father
with a better son than I, and my
sister with something that even sisters
prefer to brothers. I am only
restless here. There is work to be
done beyond there. I may be
making a mistake: if so, I shall
come back and let you know.”</p>

<h3>AN OLD IRISH TOUR.</h3>

<p>It was the long vacation in Dublin,
186-. Summer reigned supreme
over the Irish capital. The
long, bright afternoons, still and
drowsy, seemed never to have an
end. The soft azure overhead, so
different from our deep blue skies,
was whole days without a cloud&mdash;rare
phenomenon in Irish weather.
It was hot. The leaves drooped
and the insects hummed, till I, a
solitary American student, holding
my chambers in college for a couple
of weeks after all others had left&mdash;waiting
for some friends to make
up a party for the seaside&mdash;began
to think of the fierce blaze of the
Broadway pavement in July. The
four o’clock promenade on Grafton
and Westmoreland streets seemed
almost abandoned by the tall, fresh-colored
Dublin belles; and even
the military band on Wednesday
afternoons in Merrion square drew
few listeners. It was dull as well
as hot.</p>

<p>Taking down volume after volume
at a venture from the shelves
of the house library, I happened
on Arthur Young’s <cite>Tour in Ireland
in 1776-9</cite>. I opened it at the account
of his visit to the Dargle. I
had not yet visited the glen, and
was interested by his description.
“What!” said I, laying the book
open on my knee, “shall I stay here
broiling for another week? I will
run down to Bray and Wicklow for
a day or two, and have a look at
the lions.” From my windows
every morning I used to look out
at the distant hills, till they seemed
to me like old acquaintances. The
next day I started. The trip is
still a pleasant one in my memory;
but it is not of my own short Wicklow
tour I am going to write, although
in these fast days it also
might now be called ancient.</p>

<p>This was my first acquaintance
with Arthur Young’s celebrated
<cite>Tour</cite>. Not long ago I met with his
work again. It was a copy of the
second edition, “printed by H.
Goldney for T. Cadell in the
Strand, <span class="smcapuc">MDCCLXXX</span>.” I recognized
my old friend at a glance.
The quaint engraving of the “Waterfall
at Powerscourt, I. Taylor,
<i lang="la">sculp.</i>,” renewed old associations,
and led to a second and more attentive
reading.</p>

<p>Although Young’s works are still
the standard authority on the agricultural
condition of England and
Ireland, one hundred years ago,
recognized in those countries, he
is not so well known on this side
of the water, and a few facts concerning
his life and writings may
be given. He was born in 1741.
He was the son of the Rev. Arthur
Young, rector of Bradford, and
sometime chaplain to Speaker Onslow.
His father was noted for
some fierce blasts against “Popery,”
but our author, in many passages
of a just and humane spirit,
shows that he did not imbibe the
iconoclast zeal of Arthur Young
the elder. His works are voluminous,
comprised in twenty volumes.
They relate almost exclusively to
the state of agriculture in the two
kingdoms and in France. His
<cite>Travels</cite> in the East, West, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
North of England, in Wales, in
Ireland, and in France, and his
<cite>Political Economy</cite>, are the chief
titles. But Arthur Young was
more than a practical farmer,
honorable as that vocation is.
He was a man of liberal education
and cultivated taste, and his works
often rise above the dull level of
the fields and are pervaded with a
true Virgilian flavor. They have
been warmly praised by such widely
different authorities as McCulloch,
De Tocqueville, and the
<cite>Times</cite> Commissioner in 1869; and
Miss Edgeworth, herself now grown
a little antiquated, says of his <cite>Tour
in Ireland</cite>: “It was the first faithful
portrait of its inhabitants.” Arthur
Young died in 1820. An extended
but not complete list of his
works will be found in Allibone.</p>

<p>Young had a high but well-grounded
idea of the place that
agriculture holds in the economy
of the state.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The details,” he says, “of common
management are dry and unentertaining;
nor is it easy to render them interesting
by ornaments of style. The tillage with
which the peasant prepares the ground;
the manner with which he fertilizes it;
the quantities of the seed of the several
species of grain which he commits to it;
and the products that repay his industry,
necessarily in the recital run into chains
of repetition which tire the ear, and fatigue
the imagination. Great, however, is
the structure raised on this foundation;
it may be dry, but it is important, for these
are the circumstances upon which depend
the wealth, prosperity, and power of nations.
The minutiæ of the farmer’s
management, low and seemingly inconsiderable
as he is, are so many links of a
chain which connect him with the state.
Kings ought not to forget that the splendor
of majesty is derived from the sweat
of industrious and too often oppressed
peasants. The rapacious conqueror who
destroys and the great statesman who
protects humanity, are equally indebted
for their power to the care with which the
farmer cultivates his fields. The monarch
of these realms must know, when he
is sitting on his throne at Westminster,
surrounded by nothing but state and
magnificence, that the poorest, the most
oppressed, the most unhappy peasant, in
the remotest corner of Ireland, contributes
his share to the support of the gaiety
that enlivens and the splendor that
adorns the scene.”</p>

</div>

<p>Our author, it will be seen, lived
close enough to the great Dr. Johnson
to catch something of the swelling
and sonorous rotundity of style
which he impressed upon the Georgian
era. And, in truth, there is a
weighty and nervous energy about
the prose writing of that age which
contrasts, not to our advantage,
with the extenuated and sharply
accented style of our day.</p>

<p>The careful investigation of his
special study led Young into minute
inquiries and much experimental
journalizing, into which it would
not be possible or even desirable
for us to follow him. We shall
therefore content ourselves with a
notice of his more general observations
in the character of tourist.</p>

<p>Arthur Young started from Holyhead
for Dunleary&mdash;as Kingstown
was then called, before the “First
Gentleman in Europe” set his august
foot upon its quay&mdash;on the 19th
of June, 1776. What a tremendous
turn of the wheel has the world taken
since then! These colonies had
just plunged slowly but resolutely
into that great struggle for independence,
the centennial commemoration
of which we shall celebrate
next year. Progress in Ireland,
though not so radical, has been
such as would have been derided
as a day-dream by the generation
then living. In the arts and sciences
the advance has been as amazing
as in politics. As we read of
Young’s tedious passage of twenty-two
hours on board the small sailing
packet of those days, we take in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
at a glance the difference of times
which has substituted for those
“Dutch clippers” the magnificent
steamships which now make the
passage between those ports with
undeviating regularity in four hours.</p>

<p>Young’s tour was made under the
auspices of the English Board of
Agriculture. It was his intention
to make a complete survey of the
state of the art in the island. He
complains, however, of the want of
encouragement his project met with
in England; the Earl of Shelburne,
“Edmund Burke, Esq.,” and a few
others being the only persons of
eminence who took the trouble to
interest themselves in the undertaking.
“Indeed,” says our author,
commenting on this indifference,
“there are too many possessors of
great estates in Ireland who wish
to know nothing more of it than
the collection of their rents”&mdash;a
remark which has not lost its force
in our own day.</p>

<p>The reception he met with in
Dublin, however, when the purpose
of his visit became known,
seems to have compensated him for
the coldness he had experienced on
the other side of the Channel.
The most distinguished persons of
the Irish capital&mdash;a title then to
some extent real&mdash;warmly encouraged
him in his project, treated
him with true Irish hospitality in
their own houses, and provided
him with letters of introduction to
facilitate his inquiries. Thus equipped,
Young felt sure of bringing his
undertaking to a successful issue;
nor did he disappoint his subscribers.
But before going further, let
us first note his impressions of the
capital.</p>

<p>Dublin exceeded his anticipations.
Its public buildings, which
still recall its old glories to the Irish-American
tourist, “are,” he says,
“magnificent; very many of the
streets regularly laid out, and exceedingly
well built.” The Parliament
House, within the walls of
which Grattan and Flood were then
exerting their growing powers, attracted
his admiration, although
some of its architectural features
seemed to him open to criticism.
Young found the subject of Union
an unpopular one wherever broached,
and, although an advocate of the
scheme, does not appear to have
imagined that in a little over twenty
years the doors of the Parliament
House would be closed upon the
representatives of Ireland. The
cold and business-like precincts of
the Bank of Ireland, as the building
is now called, make stronger by contrast
the recollection of the fervid
eloquence once heard within its
walls. Young attended the debates
frequently; but, whether it was from
English phlegm, or perhaps it would
be more just to him to say, from
the recollection of the transcendent
powers of Burke and Chatham, he
does not appear to have been carried
away by the <i lang="la">perfervidum ingenium</i>
of the Irish orators. After
naming Mr. Daly, Mr. Flood (who
had dropped out of the scene), Mr.
Grattan, Serjeant Burgh, and others,
he says: “I heard many eloquent
speeches, but I cannot say they
struck me like the exertion of the
abilities of Irishmen in the English
House of Commons.”</p>

<p>Young’s opinion of the musical
talent of Dublin would be apt also
to excite the ire of its present
opera-goers. No city in the United
Kingdom flatters itself more upon
its correct musical taste and warm
encouragement of talent. But this
is what our unabashed tourist says:
“An ill-judged and unsuccessful
attempt was made to establish the
Italian opera, which existed but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
with scarce any life for this one
winter; of course, they could rise
no higher than a comic one. ‘La
Buona Figliuola,’ ‘La Frascatana,’
and ‘Il Geloso in Cimento’ were
repeatedly performed, or rather
murdered, except the part of Sestini.
The house was generally empty
and miserably cold.” This is
no doubt an honest description of
the fortunes of the opera in his day,
but those who have witnessed the
successive appearances of Grisi, of
Piccolomini (in light <i lang="fr">rôles</i>), of Titjens,
and Patti will not accuse a
modern Dublin audience of want
of sympathy.</p>

<p>Dublin, always a gay city socially,
was enlivened in Young’s day
by the presence of a larger resident
aristocracy than ever since. The
greater power and state of the “Castle”
before the Union, the splendid
hospitality of the old Irish nobility,
the beauty of its fair dames&mdash;the
toast of more than one court, the
gallant, open-handed manners of
the native landed gentry, made it
then one of the most brilliant capitals
in Europe. Young supposes
the common computation of its inhabitants,
two hundred thousand, to
be exaggerated; he thinks one hundred
and forty or one hundred and
fifty thousand would be nearer the
mark. Although Dublin, to-day,
nearly if not quite doubles the latter
figures, and in countless ways
shares in the general progress of
the age, she misses the independent
spirit her native parliament gave
her, and which filled the smaller
city of the last century with an exuberant
life that is now absent in
her streets and along her quays.</p>

<p>Young thus sums up his observations
on the city: “From everything
I saw, I was struck with all
those appearances of wealth which
the capital of a thriving community
may be supposed to exhibit.
Happy if I find through the
country in diffused prosperity the
right source of this splendor!”
Whatever the gaiety of the capital,
the impartial observer, as Young
himself soon found, could not fail
to note through the country, notwithstanding
some gleams of better
times, the fixed wretchedness of a
whole people, bowed down under
the yoke of those penal laws the
unspeakable horror of which no
later English legislation, however
beneficent, can ever redeem. But
the native buoyancy of the Irish
character was well exemplified in
the comparatively cheerful and
quiescent spirit with which they
bore their hard lot in the breathing
space, if one may so term it, between
1750 and 1770. For some
years previous to Young’s <cite>Tour</cite>,
the general state of the country,
contrasted with what it had been
seventy years previously, was what
might almost be called prosperous.
The population was increasing, and
was not suffering from want of food;
and the penal laws in some instances
were allowed to fall into
abeyance. The country was comparatively
free from agrarian disturbances.
Whiteboys and “Hearts
of Steel” had sprung up in some
counties after Thurot’s landing in
1759, but were quickly suppressed;
their indiscriminate attacks upon
private property in some instances
causing the Catholic country people
to rise against them. The trade
of Ireland was still oppressed by
the English prohibitory laws, but
some mitigation had been granted;
and in 1778 the threatening attitude
of the Irish Volunteers at last
wrung a tardy measure of justice
from the English government. The
value of land in many counties had
more than doubled in the previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
thirty years. Much of this rise in
value was undoubtedly due to natural
causes&mdash;improved and extended
cultivation, and the increase of
population&mdash;but it is plain from
Young’s testimony, without going
to Catholic contemporary evidence,
that the rents were raised artificially
in numberless cases by the grinding
agents of the absentee landlords.
The Irish woollen trade had been
annihilated by English monopoly.
The manufacture of linen, which
was at its height in 1770, had
greatly declined in consequence
of the American difficulties, but was
beginning to revive a little. The
effect of the war had also been to
check the emigration, which was
chiefly confined, however, to the
North. Young gave particular attention
to this subject, noting down
the emigration in each parish he
visited; and the result of his observations
is summed up in these
words: “The spirit of emigrating
in Ireland appeared to be confined
to two circumstances, the Presbyterian
religion and the linen manufacture.
I heard of very few emigrants
except among the manufacturers
of that persuasion.” This
remark has of course been completely
nullified in later years by
the famine and continued misgovernment,
which at last, breaking
down the Irishman’s strong love of
home, have sent him forth as a
wanderer, but, in the designs of
Providence, to carry with him his
faith and build up a greater Catholic
Church in America&mdash;happy
also in the country and the laws
which enable him by his own exertions
to gain a position equal to
any other citizen’s, and to throw
off that poverty and servility which
too often weighed down his spirit
at home.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, it may be said
that the time of Arthur Young’s
visit was a favorable one, if any
time might be accounted favorable
in that long night of oppression
which was still brooding over Ireland,
and which had yet to reach
its darkest hour before the first
faint streaks of dawn gladdened the
eyes of its weary watchers. The
country was just touching on that
short period of flickering prosperity,
culminating in the assertion of its
constitutional independence in 1782,
but destined to set in fire and blood
in the tragedy of ’98 and the ill-starred
Union of 1800.</p>

<p>Leaving Dublin, Young first made
a short tour through Meath and
Westmeath, returning by way of
Carlow, Wexford, and Wicklow to
the capital before entering on his
more extensive circuit of the island.
In this first excursion he at once
exhibits the plan of his journal,
noting down with minuteness the
character of the soil, the course of
the crops, the nature of the tenancy,
and the condition of the people.
Potatoes were the great article of
culture, alternating with barley,
oats, and wheat. Much of the best
land was given to grazing. The
average rent of the county of Westmeath,
exclusive of waste, was nine
shillings&mdash;including it, seven shillings;
but in this, as in the other
counties near Dublin, the best land
let from twenty shillings to as high
as thirty-five shillings sterling an
acre. The rise in the price of
labor for ten years was from fivepence
and sevenpence to eightpence
and tenpence per day, but
the laborers worked harder and better.
Women got eightpence a day
in harvest. Lands in general were
leased to Protestants for thirty-one
years or three lives, but Catholics
were in almost all cases at the
mercy of their landlords. The law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
allowing Catholics to hold leases
for lives was not yet passed. June
28th, he notes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Took the road to Summerhill, the
seat of the Right Hon. H. L. Rowley;
the country cheerful and rich; and if the
Irish cabins continue like what I have
seen, I shall not hesitate to pronounce
their inhabitants as well off as most English
cottagers. They are built of mud
walls, eighteen inches or two feet thick,
and well thatched, which are far warmer
than the thin clay walls in England.
Here are few cottars without a cow, and
some of them two, a bellyful invariably
of potatoes, and generally turf for fuel
from a bog. It is true they have not always
chimneys to their cabins, the door
serving for that and window too; if
their eyes are not affected with the smoke
it may be an advantage in warmth.
Every cottage swarms with poultry, and
most of them have pigs. Land lets at
twenty shillings an acre, which is the
average rent of the whole county of
Meath to the occupier, but if the tenures
of middlemen are included it is not
above fourteen shillings. This intermediate
tenant between landlord and occupier
is very common here. The farmers
are very much improved in their circumstances
since about the year 1752.”</p>

</div>

<p>Although we may partially agree
in Arthur Young’s opinion that
some amelioration was visible in the
material surroundings of the Irish
peasant during the quarter of a
century preceding his visit, no equal
concession can be made regarding
his political rights. These remained
absolutely nil. The comparative
tranquillity that prevailed was the
lethargy not the security of freedom.
In a slightly altered sense might
have been uttered of the whole nation
what Hussey Burgh said of a
year or two later, referring more
particularly to the Volunteers:
“Talk not to me,” he exclaimed,
“of peace; it is not peace, but
smothered war!”</p>

<p>Contrasted with this description
of the cabins of the peasantry, the
following account of an Irish nobleman’s
country mansion in the same
county one hundred years ago will
be found interesting. Headfort is
still one of the principal residences
in that part of the country:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“July 1st: Reached Lord Bective’s in
the evening through a very fine country,
particularly that part of it from which is
a prospect of his extensive woods. No
person could with more readiness give
me every sort of information than his
lordship. The improvements at Headfort
must be astonishing to those who
knew the place seventeen years ago, for
then there were neither building, walling,
nor plantations; at present almost everything
is created necessary to form a considerable
residence. The house and
offices are new-built. It is a large plain
stone edifice. The body of the house
145 feet long, and the wings each 180.
The hall is 31½ by 24, and 17 high. The
saloon of the same dimensions; on the
left of which is a dining-room 48 by 24,
and 24 high. From the thickness of the
walls, I suppose it is the custom to build
very substantially here. The grounds
fall agreeably in front of the house to a
winding narrow vale, which is filled with
wood, where also is a river which Lord
Bective intends to enlarge. And on the
other side, the lawn spreads over a large
extent, and is everywhere bounded by
large plantations. To the right the town
of Kells, picturesquely situated among
groups of trees, with a fine waving country
and distant mountains; to the left, a
rich tract of cultivation. Besides these
numerous plantations, considerable mansion,
and an incredible quantity of walling,
his lordship has walled in 26 acres
for a garden and nursery, and built six or
seven large pineries, each 90 feet long.
He has built a farm-yard 280 feet square,
surrounded with offices of various
kinds.”</p>

</div>

<p>July 4th, there is an entry of
interest, as showing the position of
Catholic tenants at that day even
under the best landlords. Young
was then a guest of Lord Longford’s
at Packenham Hall. We give the
passage in his own words, as it is a
favorable index to our author’s
character:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Lord Longford carried me to Mr.
Marly, an improver in the neighborhood,
who has done great things, and without
the benefit of such leases as Protestants
in Ireland commonly have. He rents
1,000 acres; at first, it was twentypence
an acre; in the next term, five shillings, or
two hundred and fifty pounds a year; and
he now pays eight hundred and fifty
pounds a year for it. Almost the whole
farm is mountain land; the spontaneous
growth, heath, etc.; he has improved 500
acres.… It was with regret I heard
the rent of a man who had been so spirited
an improver should be raised so exceedingly.
He merited for his life the
returns of his industry. But the cruel
laws against the Roman Catholics of this
country remain the marks of illiberal
barbarism. Why should not the industrious
man have a spur to his industry,
whatever be his religion; and what industry
is to be expected from them in a
country where leases for lives are general
among Protestants, if secluded from terms
common to every one else? What mischiefs
could flow from letting them have
leases for life? None; but much good
in animating their industry. It is impossible
that the prosperity of a nation
should have its natural progress where
four-fifths of the people are cut off from
those advantages which are heaped upon
the domineering aristocracy of the small
remainder.”</p>

</div>

<p>Young made many inquiries here
concerning the state of the “lower”
classes, and found that in some respects
they were in good circumstances,
in others indifferent. They
had, generally speaking, plenty of
potatoes, enough flax for all their
linen, most of them a cow and
some two, and spun wool enough for
their clothes; all, a pig, and quantities
of poultry. Fuel, and fish from
the neighboring lakes, were also
plenty.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Reverse the medal,” says Young:
“they are ill clothed, make a wretched appearance,
and, what is worse, are much oppressed
by many, who make them pay too
dear for keeping a cow, horse, etc. They
have a practice also of keeping accounts
with the laborers, contriving by that means
to let the poor wretches have very little
cash for their year’s work. This is a great
oppression; farmers and gentlemen keeping
accounts with the poor is a cruel
abuse. So many days’ work for a cabin&mdash;so
many for a potato garden&mdash;so many
for keeping a horse&mdash;and so many for a
cow, are clear accounts which a poor
man can understand; but farther it ought
never to go; and when he has worked
out this, the rest ought punctually to be
paid him every Saturday night. They are
much worse treated than the poor in
England, are talked to in more opprobrious
terms, and otherwise very much
oppressed.”</p>

</div>

<p>Passing through the county Wexford,
Young diverged a little from
his route to visit the baronies of
Forth and Bargy, the peculiar character
of the people of which had
always attracted the attention of
tourists. They are supposed to
have been completely peopled by
Strongbow’s followers, and have
retained a language peculiar to
themselves. They had the reputation
even then of being better farmers
than in any other part of Ireland.</p>

<p>“July 12th: Sallied from my inn,
which would have made a very
passable castle of enchantment in
the eyes of Don Quixote in search
of adventures in these noted baronies,
of which I had heard so
much.” He did not find, however,
as much difference in the husbandry
as he expected, but the people
appeared more comfortable. Potatoes
were not the common food all
the year through, as in other parts
of Ireland. Barley bread and pork,
herrings and oatmeal, were much
used. The cabins were generally
much better than any he had yet
seen; larger, with two and three
rooms in good order and repair, all
with windows and chimneys, and
little sties for their pigs and cattle.
They were as well built, he says, as
was common in England. The girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
and women were handsomer, having
better features and complexions
than he saw elsewhere in Ireland.
Young was a poor authority on this
point, however; for he says, in the
most ungallant manner, that “the
women among the lower classes in
general in Ireland are as ugly as
the women of fashion are handsome.”
A remark equally composed
of truth and falsehood: a
handsome Irish lass being as easily
found in any townland as in any
Dublin drawing-room. Young was
a good man and a good farmer, but
we fear in this case his cockney
prejudices deceived him.</p>

<p>Understanding that there was a
part of the barony of Shellmaleive
inhabited by Quakers, rich men and
good farmers, our tourist turned
aside to visit them. A farmer he
talked to said of them: “The Quakers
be very cunning, and the d&mdash;&mdash;l
a bad acre of land will they hire.”
This excited Young’s admiration
for these sagacious Friends. He
found them uncommonly industrious,
and a very quiet race. They
lived very comfortably and happily,
and many of them were worth several
hundred pounds.</p>

<p>Returning through Wicklow to
Dublin, he passed through the Glen
of the Downs and the Dargle, as
we have already noticed. His description
of the scenery of these
noted spots is picturesquely written,
but too long to quote. July
18th, he set out for the North.
Leaving Drogheda, he made a visit
to the Lord Chief Baron Foster at
Cullen. This “great improver,” “a
title,” he says, “more deserving estimation
than that of a great general
or great minister,” had reclaimed in
twenty years a barren tract of land,
containing over 5,000 acres, which,
when Young visited it, was covered
with corn. In conversation with
him, the Chief Baron said that in
his circuits through the North of
Ireland he was on all occasions
attentive to procuring information
relative to the linen manufacture.
It had been his general observation
that where linen manufacture
spread tillage was very bad. Thirty
years before, the export of linen and
yarn had been about £500,000 a
year; it was then £1,200,000 to
£1,500,000. In 1857, the export of
linens, according to McCulloch, was
£4,400,000. In 1868, there were 94
flax-spinning factories in Ireland,
driving 905,525 spindles, employing
about 50,000 (<i lang="la">vide</i> I. N. Murphy’s
valuable work, <cite>Ireland&mdash;Industrial,
Political, and Social</cite>, London, 1870).</p>

<p>In conversation upon the “Popery”
laws, Young expressed his surprise
at their severity. The Chief
Baron said they were severe in the
letter, but were never executed.
It was rarely or never, he said
(he knew no instance), that a Protestant
<em>discoverer</em> got a lease by
proving the lands let under two-thirds
of their real value to a
Catholic. But it is plain the Chief
Baron took a more roseate view of
the situation than it deserved; the
explanation of the last-mentioned
circumstance being, as we have
seen in the case of Mr. Marly,
already mentioned, that the landlord
generally took good care to
keep the rent well up to the two-thirds
value. The penalties for
carrying arms or reading Mass were
severe, the Chief Baron admitted,
but the first was never executed
for merely poaching (rare clemency!),
and as to the other, “Mass-houses
were to be seen everywhere.”
The Chief Baron did
justice, Young says, to the merits
of the Roman Catholics, by observing
that they were in general
a very sober, honest, and industrious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
people. Arthur Young winds
up this conversation with Chief
Baron Foster, however, with the following
spirited remark, which shows
that he had not listened in vain to
the great orator of that age: “This
account,” he says, “of the laws
against them brought to mind
an admirable expression of Mr.
Burke’s in the English House of
Commons: <em>connivance is the relaxation
of slavery, not the definition of
liberty</em>.”</p>

<p>The Chief Baron was of opinion
that the kingdom had improved
more in the last twenty years than in
a century before. The great spirit
began, he said, in 1749 and 1750.
With regard to the emigrations,
which then made so much noise in
the North of Ireland, he believed
they were principally idle people,
who, far from being missed, benefited
the country by their absence.
They were generally dissenters, he
said; very few Churchmen or Catholics.</p>

<p>Coming to Armagh, Young found
the “Oak Boys” and “Steel Boys”
active in that part of the country.
He attributes their rise to the increase
of rents and the oppression
of the tithe-proctors. The manufacture
of linen was at its height;
the price greater, and the quantity
also. A weaver earned from one
shilling to one shilling and fourpence
a day, a farming laborer eightpence.
The women earned about
threepence a day spinning, and
drank tea for breakfast.</p>

<p>July 27th, in the evening, he
reached Belfast. He gives an animated
description of the town and
its trade and manufactures. “The
streets,” he says, “are broad and
straight, and the inhabitants, amounting
to about fifteen thousand, make
it appear lively and busy.” The
population of Belfast is now probably
one hundred and twenty-five
thousand. It was then already noted
for its brisk foreign trade with the
Baltic, Spain, France, and the West
Indies. The trade with North America
was greatly affected by the contumacious
behavior of the “rebels.”</p>

<p>Thence our tourist wended his
way through the North, through
the mountains and moors of Donegal,
and down the wild west coast
of Sligo and Galway. Here he describes
a wake, and the “howling”
of the “keeners” “in a most horrid
manner,” in a tone of alarm and
amazement which would put to
shame the stage “English officer”
of some of our modern Irish melodramas.</p>

<p>Continuing his route through
Clare and Limerick, he arrived at
Cork September 21st. This is his
description of the city one hundred
years ago:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Got to Corke in the evening, and
waited on the Dean, who received me with
the most flattering attention. Corke is
one of the most populous places I have
ever been in; it was market-day, and I
could scarce drive through the streets,
they were so amazingly thronged; the
number is very great at all times. I
should suppose it must resemble a Dutch
town, for there are many canals in the
streets, with quays before the houses.
Average of ships that entered in nineteen
years, eight hundred and seventy-two
per annum. The number of people
in Corke, upon an average of three calculations,
as mustered by the clergy, by the
hearth-money, and by the number of
houses, sixty-seven thousand souls, if
taken before the first of September; after
that, twenty thousand increased.”</p>

</div>

<p>These last figures appear large.
The population of Cork in 1866
was estimated at eighty thousand.
Ships entered and cleared in 1859,
4,410.</p>

<p>From Cork, Young set out for
Killarney. The lakes were already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
a great point of attraction for the
tourist. Young was in raptures
with the mingled beauty and sublimity
of the scenery. His description
of Glena, Mucross Abbey, Mangerton,
and the other wild and
beautiful features of lakes and
mountain, might almost be taken
for an account of their appearance
within the last ten years. Of Innisfallen,
he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“September 29th: Returning, took
boat again towards Ross Isle, and as Mucruss
retires from us nothing can be more
beautiful than the spots of lawn in the
terrace opening in the wood; above it,
the green hills with clumps, and the
whole finishing in the noble group of
wood above the abbey, which here appears
a deep shade, and so fine a finishing
one, that not a tree should be touched.…
Open Innisfallen, which at this
distance is composed of various shades,
within a broken outline, entirely different
from the other islands. No pencil could
mix a happier assemblage. Land near a
miserable room where travellers dine.&mdash;Of
the isle of Innisfallen it is paying no
great compliment to say it is the most
beautiful in the king’s dominions, and
perhaps in Europe. It contains twenty
acres of land, and has every variety that
the range of beauty, unmixed with the
sublime, can give. The general feature
is that of wood; the surface undulates
into swelling hills, and sinks into little
vales; the slopes are in every direction,
the declivities die gently away, forming
those slight inequalities which are the
greatest beauty of dressed grounds. The
little vallies let in views of the surrounding
lake between the hills, while the
swells break the regular outline of the
water, and give to the whole an agreeable
confusion. Trees of large size and commanding
figure form in some places natural
arches; the ivy mixing with the
branches, and hanging across in festoons
of foliage, while on the one side the lake
glitters among the trees, and on the other
a thick gloom dwells in the recesses of
the wood. These are the great features of
Innisfallen. Every circumstance of the
wood, the rocks, and lawn are characteristic,
and have a beauty in the assemblage
from mere disposition.”</p>

</div>

<p>With the exception of the “miserable
room where travellers dine,”
which happily has disappeared, this
is a good picture of the scene when
the writer visited this lovely spot.
Young elsewhere complains of the
“want of accommodations and extravagant
expense of strangers” visiting
Killarney. The “Victoria,”
the “Lake,” and other good hotels
now leave no room for reproach on
the first score; though the “stranger”
may still feelingly recognize
the point of Young’s last remark.</p>

<p>Moore had not yet written:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Sweet Innisfallen long shall dwell</div>
<div class="verse">In memory’s dream, that sunny smile</div>
<div class="verse">Which o’er thee on that evening fell,</div>
<div class="verse">When first I saw thy fairy isle.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From Killarney Young took the
road through Limerick and Tipperary.
Here he stopped at Sir
William Osborne’s, near Clonmel.
Always on the alert to note improvements,
he here describes a
scene of industry and labor which
in an extended form still attracts
the attention of the tourist:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This gentleman” (Sir W. Osborne),
he says, “has made a mountain improvement
which demands particular attention,
being upon a principle very different
from common ones. Twelve years ago
he met a hearty-looking fellow of forty,
followed by a wife and six children in
rags, who begged. Sir William questioned
him upon the scandal of a man in
full health and vigor supporting himself
in such a manner. The man said he
could get no work. ‘Come along with
me, I will show you a spot of land upon
which I will build a cabin for you, and if
you like you shall fix there.’ The fellow
followed Sir William, who was as good as
his word; he built him a cabin, gave
him five acres of a heathy mountain, lent
him four pounds to stock with, and gave
him, when he had prepared his ground,
as much lime as he would come for.
The fellow flourished; he went on gradually;
repaid the four pounds, and
presently became a happy little cottar:
he has at present twelve acres under
cultivation, and a stock in trade worth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
at least eighty pounds. The success
which attended this man in two or three
years brought others, who applied for
land. And Sir William gave them as
they applied. The mountain was under
lease to a tenant, who valued it so little
that, upon being reproached with not
cultivating or doing something with it,
he assured Sir William that it was utterly
impracticable to do anything with it,
and offered it to him without any deduction
of rent. Upon this mountain he fixed
them, giving them terms as they came
determinable with the lease of the farm.
In this manner Sir William has fixed
twenty-two families, who are all upon the
improving hand, the meanest growing
richer, and find themselves so well off
that no consideration will induce them
to work for others, not even in harvest.
Their industry has no bounds; nor is the
day long enough for the revolution of
their incessant labor.</p>

<p>“Too much cannot be said in praise of
this undertaking. It shows that a reflecting,
penetrating landlord can scarcely
move without the power of creating
opportunities to do himself and his country
service. It shows that the villany of the
greatest miscreants is all situation and
circumstance; <em>employ</em>, don’t <em>hang</em> them.
Let it not be in the slavery of the cottar
system, in which industry never meets its
reward, but, by giving property, teach the
value of it; by giving them the fruits of
their labor, teach them to be laborious.
All this Sir William Osborne has done,
and done it with effect, and there probably
is not an honester set of families in
the county than those which he has formed
from the refuse of the Whiteboys.”</p>

</div>

<p>Exception will be justly taken
here to the use of the word “miscreants,”
of which nothing appears
to show that these poor people were
deserving the name, and which is
probably used generally; but let it
be remembered that these sentiments
were written one hundred
years ago, and by an Englishman
who, from his position, might well
be supposed to share all the prejudices
of his race, and the philanthropy
and love of justice which
belonged to Young’s character will
conspicuously appear. What a revelation
of the state of the country
and the condition of its native people,
when a stranger utters these
appalling words (to our ears) to its
landlords: “<em>Employ</em>, don’t <em>hang</em>
them.”</p>

<p>In September, 1869, the <cite>Times</cite>
Commissioner in Ireland thus wrote
of the great-grandchildren of these
men:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I took care to visit a tract in this
neighborhood which I expected to find
especially interesting. Arthur Young
tells us how, in his day, Sir William Osborne
of Newtownanner encouraged a
colony of cottiers to settle along the
slopes that lead to the Commeraghs, and
how they had reclaimed this barren wild
with extraordinary energy and success.
The great-grandchildren of these very
men now spread in villages along the
range for miles, and, though reduced in
numbers since 1846, they still form a considerable
population. The continual
labor of these sons of the soil has carried
cultivation high up the mountains, has
fenced thousands of acres and made
them fruitful, has rescued to the uses of
man what had been the unprofitable domain
of nature. These people do not
pay a high rent. They are for the most
part under good landlords; but I was
sorry to find this remarkable and most
honorable creation of industry was generally
unprotected by a certain tenure.
The tenants with hardly a single exception
declared they would be happy to
obtain leases, which, as they said truly,
would ‘secure them their own, and stir
them up to renewed efforts.’”</p>

</div>

<p>A few years before the visit of
the <cite>Times</cite> Commissioner, the writer
of this article passed along the
same road on his way to Clonmel
and Fethard, and still vividly remembers
the remarkable appearance
of the long range of these little
holdings climbing high up the steep
side of the mountains; the clustering
cabins; the narrow paths winding
up to them; and, higher than all,
the gray masses of mist sweeping
along the rocks and purple heath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span></p>

<p>From Clonmel Arthur Young proceeded
to Waterford, and thence, on
the 19th of October, the wind being
fair, took passage in the sailing
packet, the <cite>Countess of Tyrone</cite>, for
Milford Haven, Wales&mdash;thus bringing
to an end his first and most interesting
tour in Ireland.</p>

<p>In a subsequent volume, he relates
his experiences two years
later. But this second volume,
though valuable, is not of the
same interesting character as the
first. It consists chiefly of chapters
under general headings, such
as Manufactures, Commerce, Population,
etc. It is speculative and
theorizing, and has not the freshness
of particular incidents and
observations. Nevertheless, it will
always be consulted by the student
who desires to learn from an impartial
English observer the condition
of Ireland one hundred years
ago.</p>

<p>The following are the laws of
discovery, as they were called, given
by Young in his chapter on “Religion,”
vol. ii., as in force in his day.
They are given in his own words:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“1. The whole body of Roman Catholics
are absolutely disarmed.</p>

<p>“2. They are incapacitated from purchasing
land.</p>

<p>“3. The entails of their estate are
broken.</p>

<p>“4. If one child abjures that religion,
he inherits the whole estate, though he is
the youngest.</p>

<p>“5. If the son abjures the religion, the
father has no power over his estate, but
becomes a pensioner upon it in favor of
such son.</p>

<p>“6. No Catholic can take a lease for
more than 31 years.</p>

<p>“7. If the rent of any Catholic is less
than two-thirds of the full improved
value, whoever discovers takes the benefit
of the lease.</p>

<p>“8. Priests who celebrate Mass must
be transported; and if they return, to be
hanged.</p>

<p>“9. A Catholic having a horse in his
possession above the value of five pounds
to forfeit the same to the discoverer.</p>

<p>“10. By a construction of Lord Hardwick’s
they are incapacitated from lending
money on mortgage.”</p>

</div>

<p>“The preceding catalogue,” says
Young, with grave irony, “is very
imperfect. But,” he continues, “it
is an exhibition of oppression fully
sufficient.”</p>

<p>With these words may fitly be
concluded a notice of Ireland one
hundred years ago. Twenty years
after Arthur Young wrote them, the
short period of comparative peace
he chronicled ended, and the pitch-cap
became the emblem of English
government in Ireland.</p>

<h3>BROTHER PHILIP.<br />
<span class="smaller">CONCLUDED.</span></h3>

<p>It was reserved for Brother Philip
not only to give a fresh impetus
to the Institute of the Christian
Schools, but also to see it acquire
an additional and important title
to respect by a new form of self-devotion
on the fields of battle.
Never had the Brothers failed to
prove their loyal love of their country,
but the year 1870, so terrible to
France, brought out their patriotism
in all its active energy.</p>

<p>There is no need that we should
relate how, in the July of that year,
Napoleon III., who was unprepared
for anything, provoked King William,
who was prepared for everything,
it being our object to give
the history of self-devotion, not to
recall mistakes.</p>

<p>The best Christians are always
the truest patriots. The heart of
Brother Philip thrilled at the very
name of France, and he so well
knew that France could equally
reckon on his Brothers that he did
not even consult them before he
wrote his letter of the 15th of August
to the Minister of War, in
which he said that they would wish
to profit by the time of vacation
to serve their country in another
manner than they had been wont;
at the same time placing at his disposal,
to be turned into ambulances,
all the establishments belonging to
the Institute, as well as all the communal
schools directed by the Brothers,
who would devote themselves
to the care of the sick and wounded.
“The soldiers love our Brothers,”
wrote the Superior, “and our Brothers
love the soldiers, a large number
of whom have been their pupils,
and who would feel pleasure in being
attended to by their former masters.…
The members of my Council,
the Brother Visitors, and myself
will make it our duty to superintend
and to encourage our Brothers in
this service.” All the houses of
the Christian Schools, therefore,
were speedily put in readiness to
receive the wounded. Some of the
Brothers were left in charge of the
classes. Wherever they were wanted
they were to be found. We find
them for the first time engaged in
their new work after the engagements
of the 14th, 16th, and 18th
of August, which took place around
Metz, where trains filled with
wounded were sent by Thionville
to the Ardennes and the North.
Supplies of provisions were organized
at Beauregard-lez-Thionville
by the Brother Director of that
place, for these poor sufferers, who
were in want of everything; all the
families of the town with eager
willingness contributing their share.
Thus eight trains, carrying five
hundred wounded, successively received
the succor so much needed.
At St. Denis, the Brothers
responded to the municipal vote
which had just been passed for
their suppression by their active
zeal in the service of the <i lang="fr">bureau de
subsistence</i>, or provision-office. In
many towns the military writings
were entrusted to them. At Dieppe,
being installed in the citadel, they
made more than 120,000 cartridges.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
On the 17th of August, Brother
Philip received, with the most cordial
kindness, two hundred firemen
of Dinan and St. Brieuc, forming
part of the companies of the Côtes-du-Nord,
who had hastened to the
defence of Paris&mdash;himself presiding
at their installation in the mother-house,
and bidding them feel quite
at home there, as the Brothers were
the “servants of the servants of their
country.” There the good Bretons
remained four days, each receiving
a medal of Our Blessed Lady from
the Superior-General when the time
came for departure. The Brothers
of the <i lang="fr">pensionnat</i> of S. Marie at
Quimper, during the early part of
August, received more than fifteen
hundred military in their dormitories,
the Brothers of Aix-les-Bains,
Rodez, Moulins, and Châteaubriant
also affording hospitable lodging
to numerous volunteers. “At one
time,” said the Brother Director of
Avignon, “we were distributing
soup, every morning and evening, to
from five hundred to seven hundred
engaged volunteers, and also to a
thousand zouaves who had been
housed by the Brothers of the Communal
Schools; we were at the same
time lodging at the <i lang="fr">pensionnat</i> three
hundred and sixty of the <i lang="fr">garde mobile</i>;
thus, in all, we had charge of
about two thousand men.”</p>

<p>The officers and soldiers of the
eighth company of <i lang="fr">mobiles</i> at Aubusson
were so grateful for the kindness
shown them by the Brother Director
that they wished to confer on him
the rank of honorary quartermaster,
and decorate him with gold stripes.
The Brothers at Boulay, six leagues
from Metz, were the first to observe
the superior quality of the enemy’s
army and the severity of its discipline.
A doctor of the Prussian
army said to them on one occasion,
“We shall conquer because we pray
to God. You in France have no
religion; instead of praying, you
sing the <cite>Marseillaise</cite>. You have
good soldiers, but no leaders capable
of commanding: Wissembourg,
Forbach, and Gravelotte<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> have
proved this. Your army is without
discipline, while our eight hundred
thousand march as if they were one
man. And then our artillery …
which has hardly yet opened fire!”
These words were uttered on the
25th of August, by which time the
fate of France could be only too
plainly foreseen. The Brothers of
Verdun showed a courage equal to
that of the defenders of the place.
From the 24th of August to the
10th of November, they were to be
seen on the ramparts succoring the
wounded, carrying away the dead,
working with the firemen, in the
midst of the bombs, to extinguish
the conflagrations, besides attending
on the wounded in the ambulance
of the Bishop’s house. The
Brothers at Pourru-Saint-Rémy, by
their courageous remonstrances, saved
the little town from destruction,
and also the lives of two Frenchmen
whom the Prussians were about to
shoot.</p>

<p>The same works of mercy were
being carried on at Sedan amid
the horrors of that fearful time&mdash;when
seventy thousand men were
prisoners of war, and in want of
everything; when every public
building, and even the church, was
filled with wounded. Some of the
Brothers went from door to door
begging linen, mattresses, and straw,
while others washed and bound up
the wounds, aided the surgeons,
and acted as secretaries to the poor
soldiers desirous of sending news
of themselves to their families.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span></p>

<p>The Brother Director at Rheims
gives the following account of his
visit on the 22d of September to
the battle-field around Sedan: “We
began by Bazeilles,” he writes, “and
truly it was a heartrending spectacle.
This borough of two thousand
five hundred inhabitants, which I
had recently seen so rich and prosperous,
is entirely destroyed. The
only house left standing is riddled
with shot, all the rest being mere
heaps of charred stones, still smoking
from the scarcely extinguished
burning. The field of battle was
still empurpled with blood, and
trampled hard like a road, while in
all directions were scattered torn
garments, rifled wallets, and broken
weapons.”<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>The ambulance of Rethel received,
in four months, eight hundred
men, many Prussians being of the
number. Several of the Brothers
fell ill from their excessive exertions,
and from typhus, caught in
the exercise of their charitable employment,
the latter proving fatal
in the case of Brother Bénonien.
One of the Directors dying at Châlons-sur-Marne,
the Prussians, in
token of their respect, allowed the
bells, which had been silent since the
invasion of the town, to be tolled
for his funeral. At Dîjon the Brothers
were repeatedly insulted by a
handful of demagogues, who would
fain have compelled them to take
arms and go to the war while they
themselves staid at home; but when,
soon afterwards, these same Brothers
who had been derided as “lazy
cowards,” were seen bearing in their
arms the wounded men&mdash;whom
they had on more than one occasion
gone out to seek with lanterns, amid
rain and mud and darkness&mdash;gently
laying them in clean white beds,
and attending to all their wants
with the tenderest solicitude, the
mockers were silenced, and their
derision forgotten in the admiration
of the grateful people. It was
here also that, after the battle of the
30th of October, many Garibaldians
who were among the wounded beheld
with astonishment the calm
devotedness of these “black-robes,”
whom they had always been accustomed
to malign. Not content
with begging their pardon merely,
they were exceedingly desirous that
Garibaldi should award military
decorations to certain of the Brothers,
who would have had as strong
an objection to receive the honor
from such hands as the godless
Italian would have had to confer
it; nor did the cares lavished by
these religious on his companions
in arms hinder his execrations of
the priests and religious orders in
his proclamation of January 29,
1871.</p>

<p>In Belgium as well as in France
the good offices of the Brothers
found ample exercise. After the
defeat of Gen. de Failly, more than
eleven hundred exhausted and famishing
soldiers, with their uniforms
torn to shreds after a march of ten
leagues through the woods, arrived
at a late hour of the night, on the
1st of September, at the house of
the Brothers at Carlsbourg, not
knowing what place it was. Great
was the joy of the poor fugitives at
the unexpected sight of that well-known
habit and those friendly
faces. All were welcomed in, and
their lives saved by the timely hospitality
so freely accorded to their
needs. The sick and wounded had
already been brought in carts from
the scene of the engagement, and
were receiving every care under the
same roof. All through the month
of September this house was a centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
of assistance, information, and
correspondence, as well as of unbounded
hospitality. At Namur
the Brothers converted their house
into an ambulance, and, in their
work of nursing the sick and wounded,
had able auxiliaries in many
Christian ladies of high rank.</p>

<p>While the red flag was floating
over the Hôtel de Ville at Lyons,
and those who talked the most
loudly about “the people” troubled
themselves the least on their account,
the Brothers of this town
prepared a hundred beds in their
house, and successively had charge
of seven hundred soldiers, the Brother
Director during all that time
having to maintain a persevering
resistance to the revolutionists, who
no less than twelve times attempted
to disperse the community. The
devotion of the Brothers was characterized
by a peculiar courage in
the ambulance at Beaune, reserved
for sufferers from the small-pox,
and which none but they dared
approach. At Châlons-sur-Saône
they had four ambulances, in the
charge of which they were aided by
some nursing Sisters. Many Germans
were among their wounded at
Orléans and at Dreux. It was at
the latter place that one of the
chief medical officers of the Prussians,
a very hard-hearted man,
who had made himself the terror
of the ambulance as well as of the
town, gave orders that every French
soldier, as soon as he began to recover,
should be sent a prisoner to
Germany; the Brothers, however,
did not rest until they had so far
softened him as to save their convalescents
from the threatened captivity.</p>

<p>But we should far exceed the
limits of our notice were we to follow
with anything like completeness
the work of the Brothers in
the departments of France. The
places particularized suffice as an
indication of what was done in
numbers more, in several of which
some of the Brothers fell victims to
their charity. The testimony of
the medical men, in praise not only
of their unwearied devotion, but
also of their skill in the care of
the sick and wounded, was everywhere
the same. It seems scarcely
credible that in several localities&mdash;at
Villefranche and Niort amongst
others&mdash;where they were unostentatiously
carrying on these self-denying
labors, the municipal councils,
as if to punish them for their
generosity, withdrew the annual
sum which had for years past (in
one case, for sixty-four years)
been allowed to their schools for
the expenses of administration. It
frequently happened that, in opening
ambulances, they did not, for
that reason, discontinue their
classes, those who taught in the day
watching by the sick at night; giving
up for the good of others their
time, their repose, their comfort&mdash;all
they had to give. The Committees
of Succor did much, but it
seemed as if without them something
would have been wanting to
the ambulances. For additional
particulars we must refer the reader
to the interesting pages of M.
Poujoulat, from which we have
drawn so largely. And now, having
in some measure sketched the
work of the Brothers in the provinces
during the war, we must not
leave it unnoticed in the capital.</p>

<p>Towards the end of November,
1870, Brother Philip, after receiving
the appeal from the ambulances of
the Press, issued no order to the
Brothers of the communities in
Paris, but simply informed them of
the request that had been made
him, bidding them consider it before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
God, and adding, “You are free
to give your assistance or to withhold
it.” The Brothers prayed,
went to Communion, and then said
to their Superior, “We are ready.”
Even the young novices in the
Rue Oudinot wrote to him letters
of touchingly earnest entreaty to
be allowed to serve with their elders.
We give the following in the
words of M. Poujoulat:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On the 29th of November, at six
o’clock in the morning, in piercing cold,
a hundred and fifty of the Brothers of the
Christian Schools were assembled at the
extremity of the Quai d’Orsay, near the
Champ de Mars. An old man was with
them in the same habit as themselves;
this was Brother Philip, his eighty years
not appearing to him any reason for staying
at home. They were awaiting the
order to march. Gen. Trochu, acting
less in accordance with his own judgment
than with the imperious despatches
sent from Tours and with the wishes of
the Parisians, proposed to pierce through
the enemy’s lines and join the army of
the Loire. The attack having been retarded
by an overflow of the Marne, and
the necessity of throwing additional
bridges across the river, the Brothers
waited eight hours for an order which
never came. On the following morning,
the 30th, they were again with Brother
Philip at the same post, at the same
hour, and shortly received the order to
advance, while, with profound emotion,
the venerable Superior, after seeing his
‘children,’ as he was wont to call them,
depart, returned alone to the Rue Oudinot.</p>

<p>“Cannonading was heard towards the
southeast. The two corps of the army,
under Gens. Blanchard and Renault, had
attacked Champigny and the table-land
of Villiers. The Brothers, mounted in
various vehicles, proceeded towards the
barrier of Charenton, on their way receiving
many encouraging acclamations
from the people. Their work commenced
on the right bank of the Marne, which
they crossed on a bridge of boats, not far
from Champigny and Villiers, amid the
rattling of musketry and the roar of
heavy guns. Divided into companies of
ten, each with its surgeon, provided with
litters, and wearing the armlet marked
with the Red Cross, they proceed to
seek the wounded, troubling themselves
little about finding death. They are attended
by ambulance carriages, in which
they place the sufferers, who are taken to
Paris by the <i lang="fr">bateaux mouches</i> (small packet-boats
of the Seine). When litters are not
to be had, the Brothers themselves carry
those whom they pick up, sometimes for
long distances, never seeming to think
themselves near enough to danger, because
they wish to be as near as possible
to those who may be reached by the shell
and shot. They walk on tranquilly and
fearlessly, the murdering projectiles appearing
to respect them. They have
lifted up the brave Gen. Renault, mortally
wounded by the splinter of a bomb.</p>

<p>“This general, before his death, a few
days afterwards, said to the Brother Director
of Montrouge: ‘I have grown gray
on battle-fields; I have seen twenty-two
campaigns; but I never saw so murderous
an engagement as this.’ And it was
in the midst of this tempest of fire that
the Brothers fulfilled their charitable
mission. No one could see without admiration
their delicate and intelligent
care of the wounded.”</p>

</div>

<p>On this latter subject, M. d’Arsac
writes as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They” (the Brothers) “knelt down
upon the damp earth&mdash;in the ice, in the
snow, or in the mud&mdash;raising the heavy
heads, questioning the livid lips, the extinguished
gaze, and, after affording the
last solace that was possible, recommencing
their difficult and perilous journey
across the ball-ploughed land, through
the heaps of scattered fragments and of
corpses, amid the movements to and fro
upon the field of carnage. Very gently
they lift this poor fellow, wounded in the
chest, raising him on a supple hammock
of plaited straw, keeping the head high,
and placing a pillow under the shoulders,
avoiding anything like a shock.… Thus
they advance with slow and even pace
never stopping for a moment to wipe
their foreheads. A woollen covering envelops
the wounded man from the shoulders
downward. Often his stiffened
hand still clutches his weapon with a
spasmodic grasp, … the arm hangs
helplessly, and from minute to minute
a shiver runs over the torn frame. He
faints, or in a low whisper names those
he loves. The Brothers quicken their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
steps. The ‘Binder’ carriage is not
yet there; so they lay their burden
gently down upon a mattress, in some
room transformed into an ambulance,
where a number of young men, in turned-up
sleeves and aprons of operation, are
in attendance. They pour a cordial
through the closed teeth of the sufferer,
complete the amputation of the all but
severed limb, and do that to save life
which the enemy did to destroy it.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Brother Director of Montrouge
gives the following account
of the night which followed the
battle of Champigny:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Being stronger and more robust than
the rest, I got into one of Potin’s wagons,
and returned to beat the country around
Champigny, Petit-Bry, and Tremblay.
On reaching the plateau of Noisy, where
lay many wounded, uttering cries of pain
and despair, a soldier, who was cutting a
piece of flesh from a horse killed that
morning, told me that the Prussians
would not allow them to be removed, and
that if I went further I should be made
prisoner. I went on, notwithstanding,
in the hope of succoring these poor fellows,
but presently a patrol fire barred
the way against me, and compelled me
to believe the statement of the marauding
soldier. It was one o’clock in the morning;
and I went away, grieved to the
heart at the thought of those unhappy
men lying there on the cold earth, into
which their life-blood was soaking, in the
piercing cold, and under the pitiless eye
of an inhuman enemy. The man who
drove my conveyance was afraid, and his
wearied horses refused to go a step further;
I left them therefore in the road,
and, lantern in hand, walked along the
lanes, through the woods, across the
fields, but found everywhere nothing but
corpses. I called, and listened, but
everywhere the only answer was the
silence of death. At last I went towards
the glimmering lights of the watch-fires
of our soldiers, and learnt that on the
hill, into a house which had been left
standing, several men had been carried
at nightfall; and there in fact I found
them, twenty-one in number, lying at the
foot of a wall whither they had dragged
themselves from a ditch where they had
been left, and patiently waiting until some
one should come to their assistance.
Happily I was soon joined here by others,
who helped me to place the wounded in
different vehicles, and we set out for
Paris, where we arrived at half-past four
in the morning. After seeing them safely
housed, I set out again for Champigny,
longing to know the fate of the poor
creatures whose cries had pierced my
very soul, without my being able to succor
them. I hastened to the plateau of
Noisy, and there found eighty frozen
corpses. Some had died in terrible contortions,
grasping the earth and tearing
up the grass around them; others, with
open eyes and closed fists, appeared fierce
and threatening even in death; while
others again, whose stiffened hands were
raised to heaven, announced, by the composure
of their countenances, that they
had expired in calmness and resignation,
and perhaps pardoning their executioners
the physical and moral tortures they endured.”</p>

</div>

<p>During any suspension of arms,
the Brothers buried the dead, digging
long trenches in the hard and
snow-covered earth, in which the
corpses, in their uniforms, were laid
in rows. A single day did not suffice
for these interments, everything
being done with order and respect.
When all was ended, the falling
snow soon spread one vast winding-sheet
over the buried ranks, while
the Brothers, having finished their
sad day’s toil by torchlight, knelt
down and said the <cite>De profundis</cite>.</p>

<p>Every fresh combat saw these
acts of intrepid charity renewed.
Brother Philip, although, on account
of his advanced age, not himself
on the field, was the moving
spirit of the work. Daily, before
the Brothers started for their labors,
he multiplied his affectionate and
thoughtful attentions, going from
one to another during the frugal
breakfast which preceded their departure,
with here a word of encouragement
and there of regard.
He arranged and put in readiness
with his own hands the meagre pittance
for the day, and examined
the canteens and wallets to see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
nothing was wanting. His paternal
countenance wore an expression of
happiness and affection, not untinged
with melancholy, and seemed to
say, “They go forth numerous and
strong, but will they all return?”</p>

<p>On the morning of the 21st of
December, 1870, long before daybreak,
Brother Philip and a hundred
and fifty of his “children”
were at their usual place near the
Champ de Mars; others of their
number, under the direction of Brother
Clementis, having been sent
on the previous evening to sleep at
St. Denis. The roar of the cannon
on this morning was terrible. It
was the battle of Bourget. The
Brothers, after reaching the barrier
of La Villette, hastened to the
points where men must have fallen,
and were soon carrying the wounded
in their arms to the ambulance-carriages,
and returning for more,
regardless of the hail of shot whistling
around them. Two courageous
Dominicans had joined the company
led on by Brother Clementis,
which was preceded by a Brother
carrying the red-cross flag of the
Convention of Geneva, and not attended
by any soldier, when they
received a charge of musketry. One
of the Brothers, “Frère Nethelme,”
fell mortally wounded, and was
laid on the litter he was carrying
for others, and taken by two of his
companions to St. Denis, whither
Brother Philip immediately hastened
on receiving tidings of what had
befallen him. Brother Nethelme
was one of the masters at S. Nicolas,
Rue Vaugirard, and thirty-one
years of age. He lived three days
of great suffering and perfect resignation,
and died on Christmas Eve.
His funeral took place on S. Stephen’s
Day, December 26, in the
Church of S. Sulpice, which was
thronged with a sympathizing multitude.
This death of one of their
number, instead of chilling the zeal
of the Brothers, kindled a fresh
glow of their courageous ardor.</p>

<p>Other trials of a similar nature
were in store for the Superior-General.
When, in the midst of the
bombardment of January, 1871,
great havoc was made in the house
of S. Nicolas by the bursting of a
shell, it was with an aching heart
that he beheld so many of the pupils
killed or wounded, and that, a
fortnight after the funeral of Brother
Nethelme, he followed the
young victims to their graves. This
cruel bombardment on the quarters
of the Luxembourg and the Invalides
excited the minds of the people
to vengeance, and led to the
sanguinary attempt of Buzenval.
Brother Philip having had notice
the evening before, a hundred of
the Brothers assembled in the Tuileries,
from whence they started
for the scene of action, and approached
the park of Buzenval
through a hailstorm of balls, to find
the ground already strewn with
wounded. The soaking in of the
snow having made the land a perfect
marsh, greatly increased the
difficulty of their labor, but they
only exerted themselves the more,
astonishing those who observed
them. On the 19th the Committee
of the Ambulances of the Press for
the second time addressed to the
Superior-General its thanks and
congratulations.</p>

<p>After the battle near Joinville-le-Pont,
the Brothers had to carry
the wounded a league before reaching
the carriages.</p>

<p>In this brief sketch we can give
but a very inadequate idea of the
work of the Brothers, not only in
collecting and housing the wounded,
but also in nursing them with
unwearied assiduity day and night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
The ambulance at Longchamps, a
long wooden building, had been organized
by Dr. Ricord, the first
physician in Paris, and an excellent
Christian, who had obtained numerous
auxiliaries from Brother
Philip. One of these, Brother
Exupérien, showed an extraordinary
solicitude for the four hundred
wounded of whom he there
shared the charge. The cold was
intense; there was scarcely any
fuel; and food of any kind was
difficult to be had. This good
Brother never wearied in his constant
and often far-distant search
for supplies for the many and pressing
necessities of the sufferers;
day after day walking long distances,
and often having to exercise
considerable ingenuity to get
even the scanty provision which
his perseverance succeeded in obtaining.</p>

<p>Brother Philip bestowed his especial
interest on the ambulance
established in the Mother-house,
Rue Oudinot, and which was called
the ambulance of S. Maurice. The
novices had been removed into the
nooks and corners of the establishment,
so as to give plenty of air
and space to the suffering soldiers.
All the Brothers in this house, young
and old, devoted themselves to their
sick and wounded; Brother Philip
setting the example. He would go
from one bed to another, contrive
pleasant little surprises, and do
everything that could be done to
cheer the spirits of the patients as
well as to afford them physical relief.
The Abbé Roche, the almoner
of the mother-house, exercised
with the greatest prudence and
kindness the priestly office in this
ambulance.</p>

<p>On the 1st of January, 1871,
one of the soldiers decorated at
Champigny for bravery read aloud
to Brother Philip, in the “great
room,” turned into an ambulance,
a “compliment,” in which he offered
him, as a New Year’s gift on behalf
of all, the expression of their
gratitude. On the 6th, in a letter
to the Superior-General from Count
Sérurier, vice-president of the <i lang="fr">Société
de Secours</i>, and delegate of the
Minister of War and of the Marine,
he says: “All France is penetrated
with admiration, reverence,
and gratitude for the examples of
patriotism and self-devotion afforded
by your institute in the
midst of the trials sent by Providence
upon our country.”</p>

<p>The first Brother who re-entered
Paris on the day after the signing
of the armistice at Versailles was
the Director of the orphanage at
Igny. It was like an apparition
once more from the world without,
after the long imprisonment under
the fire of the enemy.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that,
besides all that we have mentioned
from the beginning of the war to
the end of the first siege, teaching
was not neglected by the Brothers
for a single day; all else that they
were doing was but a supplement
to their ordinary occupations; and
all went well at the same time, in
the schools, the ambulances, and
on the field of battle. It was as if
they multiplied themselves for the
good of their fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>Acknowledgments in honor of
their courageous devotion were
sent from nearly every civilized
country; but amongst all these we
select one for mention as having a
particular interest for Americans.
We give it in the words of M.
Poujoulat&mdash;first stating, however,
that the <i lang="fr">Académie Française</i> had
awarded an exceptional prize, declared
“superior to all the other
prizes by its origin and its object,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
to the Institute of the Christian
Brothers. M. Poujoulat writes as
follows:<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In 1870, we were abandoned by every
government, but when our days of misfortune
commenced, we were not forgotten
by the nations. There arose, as it
were, a compassionate charity over all
the earth to assuage our sorrows. The
amount of gifts was something enormous.
One single city of the United States,
Boston, with its environs, collected the
sum of eight hundred thousand francs.
The <cite>Worcester</cite>, a vessel laden with provisions,
set sail for Havre, but on hearing
of the conclusion of peace, the insurrection,
and the second siege of Paris, the
American captain repaired to England,
where the ship’s cargo was sold, and the
amount distributed among those localities
in France which had suffered most.
When this had been done, there still remained
two thousand francs over, which
the members of the Boston Committee
offered to the <i lang="fr">Académie Française</i>, to be
added to the prize for virtue which was to
be given that year. ‘This gift,’ said the
letter with which it was accompanied, ‘is
part of a subscription which represents
all classes of the citizens of Boston, and
is intended to express the sympathy and
respect of the Americans for the courage,
generosity, and disinterested devotion of
the French during the siege of their capital.’</p>

<p>“The Academy, in possession of this
gift, deliberated as to whom the prize
should be decreed, it being difficult to
point out the most meritorious among so
many admirable deeds. After having remarked,
not without pride, upon the equality
of patriotism, the Academy resolved
to give to this prize the least personal and
the most collective character possible.</p>

<p>“‘We have decreed it,’ said the Duc
de Noailles, speaking for the Academy,
‘to an entire body, as humble as it is
useful, known and esteemed by every one,
and which, in these unhappy times, has,
by its devotedness, won for itself a veritable
glory: I allude to the Institute of
the Brothers of the Christian Schools.’</p>

<p>“After the Director of the <i lang="fr">Académie
Française</i>, in an eloquent speech had
justified the decision, he added that
‘this prize would be to the Institute as
the Cross of Honor fastened to the flag
of the regiment.’”</p>

</div>

<p>Already had the Government of
the National Defence perseveringly
insisted upon Brother Philip’s acceptance
of the Cross of the Legion
of Honor, the reward of the brave;
but his humility led him to do all in
his power to escape it, and he had
already refused it four times in the
course of thirty years. It was only
when he was assured that it was not
himself, but his Institute, that it was
desired to decorate in the person
of its Superior-General, that, sorely
against his will, he ceased to resist.
Dr. Ricord, in his quality of principal
witness of the devotedness of
the Brothers, was charged to attach
the Cross of Honor to Brother
Philip’s cassock, in the <i lang="fr">grande salle</i>,
or principal room, of the mother
house. Never had the saintly Superior
known a more embarrassing
moment than this in all the course
of his long life; and when he conducted
Dr. Ricord to the door of
the house, he managed so effectively
to conceal his new decoration that
no one would have suspected its existence.
He never wore it after
this occasion; and this Cross of
Honor which he wished to hide
from earth remains as a sort of
mysterious remembrance. It has
never been found again.</p>

<p>Always clear-sighted and well-informed,
the Superior-General had
been watching the approach of the
insurrection of the 18th of March,
and sent away the pupils of the
Little and Great Novitiates, foreseeing
that Paris was about to fall
into the power of the worst enemies
of religion and civilization. The
satanic character of the Commune
declared itself in the words of Raoul
Rigault, one of its chiefs, who
said: “So long as there remains a
single individual who pronounces
the name of God, everything has
yet to be done, and there more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
shooting will always be necessary.”
The Commune began its work by
beating down the cross on the
church of S. Géneviève, and putting
the red flag in its place. We
cannot wonder, therefore, at its
hatred of the Christian Brothers&mdash;their
Christianity being an unpardonable
crime. They were not
even allowed to remove the wounded,
who were left to die untended
in the street, rather than that they
should be succored by religious.</p>

<p>Two decrees were passed, one
putting the state in possession of
all property, movable or otherwise,
belonging to the religious communities,
and the other incorporating
into the marching companies all
valid citizens between nineteen and
forty years of age. The Commune
was returning to its traditions of
’93, “interrupted,” it was stated,
“by the 9th of Thermidor.” There
were to be no more Christian
schools; no more Christ; no more
religion; no more works of piety,
Catechism, First Communion, the
Church&mdash;all these were proscribed,
and none but atheists might keep
a school.</p>

<p>But we will give some extracts
from a circular issued to his community
by the Superior on the 21st
of June, 1872, in which he briefly
notes down the events of these
dreary days:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The festival of Easter (April 9th) was
spent in anxiety, sadness, and mourning,
for Monseigneur the Archbishop and
several priests have been arrested as
hostages.</p>

<p>“April 10th: Some of our Brother Directors
were officially informed that my
name had been placed on the proscription
list, and that I should be arrested
forthwith. Yielding, therefore, to the solicitations
of my Brother Directors, and
to the injunctions of our dear Brother Assistants,
I quitted Paris to visit our houses
in the provinces.</p>

<p>“On the 11th of April, towards ten
o’clock in the morning, a commissioner
and delegate of the Commune, accompanied
by forty of the National Guard,
surrounded the house, announcing that
they had orders to take me away, and to
search the establishment. Brother Calixtus
told them that I was absent, and accompanied
them wherever they wished to
go. They carried off the money that remained
in the chest, as well as two ciboria,
two chalices, and a pyx, after which
they declared that, in default of finding
the Superior, they were to lead off the
person who had been left there in his
place.</p>

<p>“The dear Brother Calixtus presented
himself, and was ordered by the commissioner
to follow him; whereupon there
ensued a scene which it would be impossible
to describe. All the Brothers insisted
on following our dear Brother Assistant;
and some even of the National
Guards were moved to tears. A crowd
of people collected in the street, expressing
grief and indignation. The commissioner
then gave a promise that Brother
Calixtus should not be detained a
prisoner, at the same time bidding him
get into a cab, which took him to the
prefecture of police. There he was set
at liberty, and returned to the mother-house.</p>

<p>“From the 10th to the 13th our Brothers
of Montrouge, Belleville, and S.
Nicolas were expelled, and lay teachers
put in their place. On the 17th the house
at Ménilmontant was searched at the very
time that the Brothers were engaged with
the classes; they were arrested, and detained
prisoners until the 22d, during
which time they were threatened and
insulted in various ways. On the 18th a
staff of military <i lang="fr">infirmiers</i> was substituted
for the Brothers in charge of the ambulance
at Longchamps, and the Brother
Assistants were officially informed that it
was resolved upon to arrest the Brothers
<i lang="fr">en masse</i>, in order either to imprison
them or to enrol them for military service.
Thus they put soldiers with our
sick, and intended to send us on the
ramparts to defend the cause of our persecutors,
who were also the enemies of
order and religion. It was a critical moment,
but Providence came to our aid in
a particular manner. Many persons, several
of whom were unknown to us, offered
their assistance in contriving to send out
of Paris those of our Brothers who were
between nineteen and forty years of age,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
and, thanks to God’s goodness and to
this friendly aid, a certain number, by
one means or another, daily effected their
escape.</p>

<p>“During the period between the 19th
of April and the 7th of May, all our free
schools were successively closed, and the
emigration of the Brothers continued.
This, however, could not be completely
accomplished; new orders, more and
mote suspicious and oppressive, having
been issued by the Commune, an increasingly
rigorous surveillance was
kept up, and the Brother Director of S.
Marguérite and two of his subordinates
were arrested in their community. Towards
the 7th of May, from thirty to forty
of the Brothers who were attempting to
escape were also arrested, either at the
railway stations or at the city gates, or
even outside the ramparts. A few of
these were released, but twenty-six were
taken to the Concièrgerie, and from thence
to Mazas.</p>

<p>“Of all our establishments, one alone
never ceased working, namely, that of S.
Nicolas, Vaugirard, which, even when
times were at their worst, numbered its
thirty Brothers and three hundred pupils.</p>

<p>“The projectiles of the besieging army
having reached Longchamps, it was
found necessary to remove further, into
the city the sick and wounded with which
the ambulance was crowded. It was
then that, on an order of the Committee
of Public Health, our house was requisitioned
by the Administration of the Press,
who required there a hundred beds. It
was arranged that the Brothers should
undertake the attendance on the sick, but
scarcely had they begun to organize the
work before a new order arrived from the
committee, forbidding any of the Brothers
to remain in the house under pain of
arrest and imprisonment. Our dear
Brother Assistants therefore, with the
others who until then had remained at
the post of danger, as well as our sick
and aged men, found themselves compelled
to quit that home which could no
longer, alas! be railed the mother, but
the widowed, house, and, during five or
six days, the abode of pain and death.
The ambulance was established there
under the direction of the Press, the administrators
of which testified a kindly
interest towards us, and we gladly acknowledge
that to them we owe the preservation
of our house, which, but for
them, would in all probability have been
given up to the flames.</p>

<p>“On Sunday, the 21st of May, there
was no Mass in our deserted chapel, from
whence the Blessed Sacrament had been
removed the evening before. The persecution
against us had reached its height,
and also its term. That same day the
besieging army forced the Gate of St.
Cloud, and on the next, the 22d, took
possession of our quarter, and put an
end for us to the Reign of Terror.…</p>

<p>“All this week was nothing but one
sanguinary conflict; our mother-house
was crowded with wounded to the number
of six hundred; a temporary building
had also been erected within its precincts,
to which were brought those who were
slain in the neighborhood; as many as
eighty dead would sometimes be carried
in at a time. On Wednesday, the 24th,
however, the military authorities decided
that the ambulance should be transferred
back again to Longchamps, and that the
Brothers should immediately be restored
to the possession of the mother-house as
well as of their other establishments.
From that day a new order of things
commenced for us, and with it the reflux
into Paris of our emigrated Brothers.</p>

<p>“But all were not able to return;
some were prisoners at Mazas. Already,
out of hatred to religion, the Commune
had shot Monseigneur the Archbishop,
the <i lang="fr">cure</i> of the Madeleine, and several
other priests, secular and regular, … and
they now proposed to shoot <em>all</em> their prisoners,
and renew in 1871 the massacre
of 1792. But again time failed them.</p>

<p>“The liberating army, like an irresistible
torrent, carried away the barricades,
and the firing soon began around Mazas,
whereupon the keepers of the prison
seized the Communist director and locked
him up, opening all the doors, and bringing
down the captives&mdash;between four and
five hundred in number&mdash;into the court,
from whence they made their exit three
by three. Our Brothers went out; but
only to find themselves entangled in the
lines of the Federals, and forced to work
at the barricades, until night seemed to
favor their escape. It was while he was
thus employed that our dearest Brother
Néomede-Justin, of Issy, was killed by
the bursting of a shell.”</p>

</div>

<p>During three days and nights the
Brothers were the objects of the
most active surveillance, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
to watch their opportunity to recede
from one barricade to another.
In this way several managed to
reach the mother-house on Friday,
the 25th; others, on the two following
days, but not all. To continue
in the words of Brother Philip:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On Whit-Sunday, towards one o’clock
in the morning, all the insurgents were
surrounded on the heights of Belleville,
disarmed, chained five together, taken to
La Roquette (the prison of the condemned),
and brought before a council
of war. Our two Brothers, who had
been also chained to three insurgents,
were present at the interrogation of those
who had preceded them, and at the execution
of sentence of death upon a large
number. For the space of three hours
they waited thus in the most anxious expectation.
When it was their turn to
appear, they said that they were Brothers
of the Christian Schools, just out of
prison, but that for three days they had
found it impossible to escape from the
vigilant oppression of the insurgents.
On ascertaining the truth of their statement,
the council gave them a pass, and
facilitated their return to the mother-house.</p>

<p>“They came back to us worn out and
broken down by fatigue, as well as by
all the terrible emotions they had undergone,
and blessing God for their wonderful
preservation.”</p>

</div>

<p>On hearing of the restoration of
order the emigrated Brothers hastened
back to Paris, their venerable
superior joining them at the mother-house
on the evening of the 9th of
June.</p>

<p>“It was,” writes Brother Philip,
“the hour of Benediction of the
Blessed Sacrament, … after which
we sang the psalm, <cite>Ecce quam bonum</cite>,
… and then I attempted to say a
few words to our dearest Brothers,
reunited once more, but I found it
impossible, so great was my emotion.”</p>

<p>When, during his absence, Brother
Philip had heard of the arrest
of Brother Calixtus, he immediately
set out from Epernay, to give
himself up in the place of his friend;
but learning, at St. Denis, that he
had been set at liberty, he proceeded
to the visitation of other houses
of his institute in the provinces.
We can understand with what joy
these two holy friends would meet
again.</p>

<p>After some great calamity has
passed away, life, emerging from the
regions of death, seems as it were
to begin anew. Brother Philip,
who regarded the misfortunes of
France as a warning from God, invited
all the members of his institute
to carry on their work with increased
energy and devotion. From
the beginning of the year 1872, as
if he had had some presentiment
of his approaching end, he gave
more attention than ever to the
perfecting of his “children,” and
completed various little works of piety
which he thought might prove
useful to them. An illness which he
had at this time he regarded as a
first warning. The Archbishop of
Paris, Mgr. Guibert, who had not
then long succeeded his martyred
predecessor, came at this time to
visit the venerable Superior.</p>

<p>Brother Philip presided at all the
sittings of the general chapter which
was assembled from the 12th of
June, 1873, to the 2d of July. Towards
the conclusion of the last sitting,
in reply to some respectful
words which had been addressed to
him, he answered: “My dearest
Brothers, soon, yes, soon you will
again assemble together, but I shall
be no longer among you. I shall
have had to render to God an account
of my administration.” It
was with heavy hearts that the Brother
Assistants heard these words,
while their Superior proceeded to
consecrate the Institute to the Sacred
Heart of Jesus.</p>

<p>Our Holy Father Pius IX. had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
for the heart of Brother Philip an
unspeakable attraction. On the
22d of October, 1873, the latter set
out on his fifth journey to Rome.
His first visit to the Eternal City
was in 1859, when he was welcomed
by the Pope with paternal affection.
He was there again in 1862, for the
canonization of the Martyrs of Japan,
when he had an opportunity
of conversing with the bishops of
many distant regions in which the
Brothers of the Christian Schools
were established. On this second
occasion, the day after his arrival
in Rome, he hastened to the Vatican
and mingled with the crowd in the
hall of audience; but the Pope
having observed his name in the
long list of the persons present, immediately
sought with his eye the
humble Superior, and, perceiving
him far off in the last rank of the
assembly, his Holiness, with that
clear and sweet voice so well known
to the faithful, said to him, <em>Philip,
where shall we find bread enough for
all this multitude?</em> (S. John vi. 5),
and bade him come near. Brother
Philip, confused at so great a mark
of attention, approached, and, kneeling
before the Holy Father, presented
the filial offering of which
he was the bearer on the part of his
Institute. He made his third journey
to Rome in 1867, to be present
at the eighteenth centenary anniversary
of the Martyrdom of the
Apostles SS. Peter and Paul. On
seeing him, the Pope said, “Here
is Brother Philip, whose name is
known in all the world.”</p>

<p>“It will soon be so at Madagascar,
Most Holy Father,” answered
Brother Philip, smiling, “as we are
just now establishing ourselves
there.”</p>

<p>In 1869, about the time of the
opening of the Vatican Council, the
Superior-General was again at
Rome. True as the needle to the
magnet was his loyal heart to the
Vicar of Christ; and yet once more
must the veteran soldier look upon
the face of his chief before laying
down his arms and receiving his
crown. He took his fifth and last
journey to the city of Peter in
1872, accompanied by Brother Firminien.
Of this last visit, which
especially concerned the beatification
of the founder of his Institute,
as well as of the preceding ones,
full particulars are given in the
work of M. Poujoulat. The Pope
received Brother Philip to private
as well as to public audiences, asking
many questions and conversing
with interest upon the details of the
various works in which the order
was engaged. On the Festival of
All Saints, more than a hundred of
the Brothers being assembled with
their Superior-General in the throne-room
at the Vatican, the Pope entered,
preceded by his court, and
attended by five cardinals, numerous
bishops, and other ecclesiastics,
for the reading of the decree referring
to the beatification of the venerable
De la Salle. When a few
lines had been read, His Holiness
said to one of the prelates, “Do not
allow Brother Philip to continue
kneeling; the brave old man must
be fatigued.”</p>

<p>The reading being ended, Brother
Philip was invited to approach
the Holy Father, to whom he made
an address of thanks for the progress
of his founder’s cause, concluding
with the following words:
“With regard to our devotion to
the Holy Church, to this ever-celebrated
chair of Peter, and to the
illustrious and infallible Pontiff who
occupies it so gloriously, it will be
the same all the days of our life;
and, moreover, we shall never cease,
Most Holy Father, to offer to God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
our most fervent prayers that he
will speedily put an end to the calamities
which afflict so profoundly
the paternal heart of Your Blessedness,
… praying Your Blessedness
to be pleased to bestow your holy
benediction upon him who has at
this moment the exceeding happiness
of kneeling at your feet, and
also upon all the other children of
the venerable De la Salle.”</p>

<p>Copies of the decree were then
distributed amongst those present,
the original manuscript, which was
presented to the Superior, being now
in the archives of the <i lang="fr">Régime</i>. The
Pope addressed his answer directly
to his “dearest son, Brother Philip,”
as if to testify his esteem not only
for the Institute but for the man.
Immediately after the closing of
the audience, the Pope despatched
messengers to the Palazzo Poli with
two immense baskets full of various
kinds of pastry, etc., saying, “Brother
Philip must assemble the Brothers
to-day for a little family feast,
and I wish to regale them”; and
when afterwards the Superior expressed
his thanks for this paternal
mark of attention, the Holy Father
answered: “Some good nuns thought
of the Pope, and the Pope thought
of Brother Philip.”</p>

<p>On his return from this last journey
to Rome, the Superior reached
Paris at seven o’clock in the morning,
was present at Mass in the
mother-house at eight, and half an
hour later was seated at his bureau
as usual in the <i lang="fr">Salle du Régime</i>, as
if he had never quitted his place.
The longest life is short; but what
can be done by a man who never
wastes a moment of his time is
something prodigious. One result
of this unceasing activity on the
part of Brother Philip was the fact
that, having found 2,300 Brothers
and 143,000 pupils when he was
placed at the head of the Institute,
he left 10,000 of the former engaged
in the education of 400,000
youths and children. He was a
man of study, prayer, and action;
no one could be more humble than
he, nor yet more qualified to govern.
He listened patiently to arguments
and suggestions, but, when
his resolution was once taken, he
adhered to it. He spoke little,
having neither taste nor time for
much talking, but what he said was
always to the point, the right thing
at the right time, and the truth on
every question. His correspondence
was a reflection of himself,
his letters containing just so many
syllables as were sufficient to express
his meaning: with him, a letter
was an action. He was at the
same time the most devout of religious
and the most assiduous of
workers; severe to himself, and
never accepting the little indulgences
which others would fain have
mingled with the hardness of his
life. The Abbé Roche mentions
that on one occasion Brother
Philip, arriving in a little town of
Cantal after forty hours of travelling,
had one hour to rest. Being
shown the way to the house of the
Brothers, he found them assembled
in the chapel, where he remained
until the prayers were over. Then,
after exchanging greetings with
them, and taking a morsel of bread
moistened with wine and water, he
resumed his journey. There are
few communities of his Institute in
France which he did not visit, and
in all these his presence left an
abiding remembrance.</p>

<p>The art of ruling presupposes a
knowledge of men. Under his simple
and modest exterior, Brother
Philip had a keen penetration; he
very quickly formed his judgment
of what a man was and what were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
his capabilities, and there could be
no better proof that he chose his
instruments wisely than the fact
that all his establishments have
succeeded; not that he always allowed
human prudence to have
much voice in his undertakings,
as he frequently preferred to leave
much to Providence. His look
and manner were reserved, almost
cold, but in his heart were depths
of real tenderness and feeling. He
allowed no recreation to his fully
occupied existence except indeed
his one refreshment and rest, which
was in attending the services at the
chapel; and his great enjoyment,
the beauty of the ceremonies and
the grand and ancient music of the
church. He never failed to bestow
the most particular attention on
every detail of the procession on
the Feast of Corpus Christi, and
took an especial delight in being
present at the First Communion of
the pupils. For this great act of
the Christian life he recommended
a long and serious preparation, and
wrote a manual with this intent,
entitled <cite>The Young Communicant</cite>.</p>

<p>He excelled in the art of solving
difficulties, not by having recourse
to human wisdom, but by imploring
light and guidance from above.
To overcome obstacles, he prayed;
he did the same to lead his enemies
to a better mind; and against their
decisions, again he armed himself
with prayer.</p>

<p>The municipal council of Châlons
had, in 1863, suppressed the
Christian schools in that town.
Brother Philip repaired thither on
the 2d of May. The mayor gave
notice that the council would assemble
on the following day. The
Superior was suffering from acute
rheumatism, but would not accept
anything but the regulation supper
of the Brothers, who made him a
bed in the parlor. The next morning,
at four o’clock, when the
community had risen, they found
Brother Philip kneeling on the
pavement of the chapel, and it
was observed that his bed had
not been touched. He had passed
the night in prayer before the
Tabernacle. At six o’clock he attended
Mass with his foot bound
up in linen. On the evening of
the same day the municipal council,
annulling its decision of the preceding
year, permitted the re-establishment
of the Christian Schools
in Châlons. The Superior had not
prayed in vain.</p>

<p>One of his principal cares was
always the reinforcement of his
Institute, and it was with exceeding
happiness that, on the 7th of
December, 1873, he presided at
the reception of fifty-four postulants.</p>

<p>It was not without apprehension
that the Brothers had seen their
venerated Superior, at eighty-one
years of age, undertake his last
journey to Rome, but after his
return his activity was unabated,
and he did not in any way diminish
his daily amount of work. On
the 30th of December, having returned
to the mother-house in the
evening from a visit to Passy, he
was indisposed, but rose the next
morning at the hour of the community.
After Mass he was seized
with a shivering; he repaired, however,
to the <i lang="fr">Salle du Régime</i>, where
deputations from the three establishments
of S. Nicolas were waiting
to offer him their respectful
greetings for the New Year. On
receiving their addresses he answered,
in a weak and failing
voice: “My dearest children, I
thank you for your kindness in
coming so early to wish me a
happy New Year; perhaps I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
not see its close. I am touched
by the sentiments you have so well
expressed, but, for my own part,
there is but one thing that I desire,
and that is, that you should
go on increasing in virtue.” After
a few more words of paternal counsel,
he bade them adieu.</p>

<p>The exchange of good wishes
between himself and the community
was not without sadness. On
the 1st of January he made a great
effort to go to the chapel, where he
heard Mass and received Holy Communion.
This was the last time
that he appeared amid the assembled
Brothers; his weakness was
extreme, and his prayers were accompanied
by evident suffering.
From the chapel the Superior went
to his bed, from which he was to
arise no more. On the 6th of January,
the Feast of the Epiphany,
he received the last sacraments,
while the Brother Assistants were
prostrate around his bed, weeping
and praying. One who appeared
more broken down with sorrow
than the rest was Brother Calixtus,
the old and most intimately beloved
friend of the dying Superior.
The Apostolic Benediction solicited
by Brother Floride at four
o’clock arrived at six, but Brother
Philip, having fallen into a profound
slumber, was not aware of it until
past midnight. The morning prayers
were being said in a low voice
in his cell, it not being known
whether he was unconscious or
not, but the Brother who presided
having, through distraction, begun
the <cite>Angelus</cite> instead of the <cite>Memorare</cite>,
the dying man gave a sign to
show that he was making a mistake.</p>

<p>There is a little versicle and response
particularly dear to the
dying members of the Institute:
“<em>May Jesus live within our hearts!</em>”
to which the answer is, “<em>For ever.</em>”
It is, as it were, their watchword
on the threshold of eternity. On
the morning of the 7th of January,
Brother Irlide, assistant, bending
over the Superior, pronounced the
words of Jesus on the Cross: “<em>Father,
into thy hands I commend my
spirit</em>,” adding, “<em>May Jesus live
within our hearts</em>.” Brother Philip,
like a faithful soldier, ever ready
with the countersign, attempted to
utter the answer “<em>For ever</em>,” but in
the effort his soul passed away.
The community being then assembled
in the chapel for the recitation
of the Rosary, at once commenced
the <cite>De profundis</cite>. The Institute
had lost its father and head.</p>

<p>The death of Brother Philip produced
a profound impression. Together
with the sense of a great
loss, a feeling of admiration for the
great qualities of the departed, and
gratitude for the immense services
he had rendered to his countrymen,
burst forth from all ranks of
society. The working-classes more
especially felt keenly how true a
friend they had lost, and the announcement,
“Brother Philip is
dead,” plunged every heart into
mourning. From the moment of
his death the cell of the Superior
was constantly filled by the novices,
who in successive companies recited
the Office of the Dead. In
the evening, the body was removed
into the Chamber of Relics, which
had been transformed into a <i lang="fr">chapelle
ardente</i>, or lighted chapel, and
there in the course of two days
more than ten thousand persons
came to pay their respects and to
pray by the dead. On the Friday
evening the remains were enclosed
in a coffin, which was covered with
garlands and bouquets which had
been brought, a tall palm being
placed at the top; and on Saturday
morning it was transferred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
the chapel, where the sorrowing
community had assembled, and
where a Low Mass of requiem was
said by the Reverend Almoner, the
Abbé Roche.</p>

<p>But another kind of funeral was
awaiting the humble religious. The
Institute, in accordance with its
rules, had ordered merely a funeral
of the seventh class; but France,
true to herself, was about to honor
her benefactor with triumphant obsequies.
The coffin, taken out of
the mother-house at a quarter past
seven, and placed upon a bier used
for the poorest of the people, was
borne to the church of S. Sulpice,
through silent and respectful multitudes,
and placed upon trestles, surrounded
by lighted tapers, in the
nave. A white cross on a black
ground behind the high altar composed
all the funeral decoration of
the church. But a splendor of its
own was attached to this poverty
and simplicity, contrasted as it was
with the vast assemblage present,
among whom were two cardinals,
several bishops, and many of the
most important personages of the
church and state. There were the
representatives of all the parishes
of Paris, and of all the religious orders,
as well as of the public administration.
Not the smallest space
remained unoccupied in the vast
church; and, when it was found
necessary to close the doors, more
than ten thousand persons remained
in the Place St. Sulpice. Cardinal
Guibert, Archbishop of Paris,
gave the absolution, and M. Buffet,
President of the National Assembly,
threw the first holy water on
the coffin.</p>

<p>“On both sides of the streets,”
writes an eye-witness, “the crowd
formed a compact mass; the men
uncovered, and the women crossing
themselves, as the body of the venerated
Superior passed by. Long
lines of children conducted by the
Brothers marched continuously on
each side. In the course of the
progress to the cemetery of Père la
Chaise, ten thousand pupils of the
Christian Brothers, school by school
taking its turn, joined without fatigue
in the procession.”</p>

<p>Paris, this city so wonderful in
its contrasts&mdash;in the brightness of
its lights and the depths of its
shadows&mdash;is more Christian than
men are apt to suppose. Out of
this Paris no less than <em>forty thousand
persons</em> attended the remains
of Brother Philip to the grave, and
many were the tears of heartfelt
sorrow which mingled with the last
prayers at the brink of that vault
where he was laid, the place of
burial reserved for the Superiors of
his order. On the day of the funeral
itself, the memory of Brother Philip
received from Cardinal Guibert, in
his circular letter addressed to the
venerable <i lang="fr">curé</i> of S. Sulpice, a testimony
which will remain as a page
in the history of the church of
Paris.</p>

<p>And it was not Paris only, but
France, which paid its homage to
the memory of Brother Philip. The
whole French episcopate testified
its regard for him by requiem
Masses on his behalf, by solemn
services, funeral orations, allocutions,
or circular letters. Nor was
this religious mourning limited to
France: it was expressed in all the
lands where the Christian Schools
have been founded, so that throughout
the world honor has been done
to him who never sought it, but who,
on the contrary, shrank from celebrity,
feared the praise of man,
and singly and simply did all for
God.</p>

<p>As the crown and completion of
all other witness to the merits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
the departed Superior, the Brothers
received in answer to the letter announcing
their bereavement a Brief
from our Holy Father Pius IX.,
most honorable to the departed,
and for themselves full of sympathy
and consolation.</p>

<p>Five months after the death of
Brother Philip, the venerable Brother
Calixtus, who had for sixty-four
years been his dearest friend, and
who was chosen as Superior-General
in his place, followed him to
the grave.</p>

<p>His present successor is Brother
Jean-Olympe, an excellent and
devoted religious, who, at the
time we write, has just returned
from Rome, where with four of the
Brother Assistants he has been welcomed
by the Holy Father with
marks of particular regard. We
conclude our sketch in the words
of M. Poujoulat, the admirable
writer already so often quoted:
“The undying remembrance of
Brother Philip will remain a motive
power for his Institute, an effective
weapon in time of conflict,
an incitement to perseverance in
well-doing, to the love of God, our
neighbor, and our duty.”</p>

<h3>THE ROMAN RITUAL AND ITS CHANT<br />
<i>COMPARED WITH THE WORKS OF MODERN MUSIC.</i><br />
II.&mdash;CONTINUED.</h3>

<h4>RESPECTIVE AUTHORITY, ECCLESIASTICAL
AND MORAL.</h4>

<p>Natural religion attaches the
idea of authority to God. God is
King, “Dominus Exercituum,” the
Lord of Hosts, the one supreme
absolute source of all power and
authority. Moreover, society implies
authority, in order that it may
exist. In social life there cannot
be discordant purposes and independent
wills. Now, God called
all created society into being out
of nothing, and through the principle
of authority and subjugation of
the will maintains his work in love,
happiness, and mutual concord.
And in the scheme of redemption
he has sent his church, a working
society upon earth, to heal by her
sweet and divine yoke of a lawful
authority the social anarchies and
disorders of a fallen race. In the
church, then, as sent by him who
is the absolute source of authority
and order, governed by him, and in
continual correspondence with him
through prayer, we expect to find
all her important elements and
modes of acting upon, and of dealing
with, mankind under the direction
of the principle of authority;
and since God declares of himself
that he is a God of order, and the
“author, not of confusion, but of
peace in the churches” (1 Cor. xiv.
33), we conclude that God will contemplate
sacred song in the Christian
Church as subject to the principle
of authority, as an instrument
placed by himself at the disposal
of the church for carrying out her
divine work, and as such to be
used, under the guidance and direction
of the authority which governs
her.</p>

<p>To put, then, what is meant by
the claim about to be made that
the Ritual or Gregorian Chant possesses
this authority, in its true light,
it would be a misconception to
suppose that the notion of a <em>positive
authority</em> is identical with that of
<em>absolute monopoly</em>. The positive
authority of the chant of the Ritual
by no means implies that the use
of modern music cannot, under
certain conditions, enjoy a just
toleration, as will be plain from an
instance. The sick man who is
slowly recovering from a severe
disease may be fully aware of the
positive authority which his physician
has for many reasons attached
to a particular rule of diet, and may
yet have the permission occasionally
to deviate from it. But now, if
it be asked, what is this authority
which is claimed for the Roman
Ritual chant-books? it may be replied,
if a spectator, at a review of
British military, were to ask what
authority the infantry regiments
had for wearing red coats, he, I
suppose, would be answered at once,
that in a disciplined army the regimental
uniform could not be otherwise
than authorized. In the same
manner, in an organized state of
society so perfect as that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
Catholic Church, the mere existence
of such song-books as the Gradual
and Antiphonary, and their immemorial
use in connection with
the Missal and Breviary, necessarily
implies their authority. It would
be in place here, if space permitted,
to cite the various archiepiscopal
and episcopal synods that have
made these or similar song-books
the subjects of their legislation,
providing, down to the minutest details,
for the different questions
which might be liable to arise out
of their use. But it may here suffice
to refer to the fact, not perhaps
sufficiently known, that the whole
of the Roman Liturgy, the entire
Breviary, the whole of the Missal,
except the few parts which the celebrant
himself recites in an undertone
of voice at the altar, has its
proper notation in music, which
every efficient choir-singer and
celebrant priest is required to know,
as the necessary accompaniment of
his functions.</p>

<p>The authority, therefore, of the
Ritual chant is to a considerable
extent identified with that of the
Ritual itself in the character of the
authorized form of its solemn celebration.
No other music has been
at any time published by the church.
No other is co-extensive with the
Ritual; and the use, therefore, of
any other, however permissible it
may have become through force of
circumstances, can only be regarded
as a deviation from perfect Ritual
rule.</p>

<p>That such was the view of the
fathers of the Council of Trent is
evident from the fact, that they seriously
debated whether it might
not be advisable to put an end to
the scandalous musical excesses
that had found their way into the
church through the partial abandonment
of the Ritual chant, by
rendering it henceforth imperative.
But though this measure was vehemently
urged by more than one father
as the best remedy for the evil
complained of, still the father of
the council at length declined to
pass the decree. They seemed to
have judged it to be on the whole
wiser to leave the Ritual chant to its
claims as the acknowledged and
authorized song of the Liturgy, and
to have thought that the remedy
required was rather to be sought
for in prayer to God to give his
people a better and more sober
mind than in a severe and peremptory
legislation, which might end in
provoking the further and worse
evil of a more formal and open
disobedience.</p>

<p>But to return to the subject of
the positive ecclesiastical authority
of the Ritual chant-books. The
truth and the reason of this authority
appear at once, on reflecting
how impossible it is that a kingdom
directed by the Spirit of God, under
the government of a divinely
founded hierarchy, should employ
sacred song to the extent which the
Catholic Church does, without a
sanctioned and authenticated form
of it. That this form should be
absolutely imperative, to the rigid
exclusion of every other, could
occur to no one to maintain. But
still, without an acknowledged body
and form of song, of such indisputable
authority as to claim the willing
confidence of those whose calling
is with sacred song, its efficacy
is certainly lamed and its mission
impeded. Men that have work to
do in God’s vineyard require to
know not merely the general truth
that what they are engaged with is
in the main good, but they also
desire to know that the blessing of
God is with the manner of their
work, and the means they employ.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
Now, such confidence nothing but
an authorized body of song can
supply.</p>

<p>For what reason do we trust the
church in her definitions of faith?
Because we feel our own weakness;
because we feel how impossible it
is for the mind to repose on its own
conclusions. We know, from a
voice that speaks from within the
heart, that our heavenly Father
could not have given a revelation
without the conditions necessary to
fit it to meet our wants. And because
we feel the need of a positive
authority in matters of faith, we
believe it to have been given, and
that the Catholic Church is the
depository of it, as alone possessing
the satisfactory credentials.
Now, although it may be true that
an equal need for a positive authority
in matters of song cannot be
asserted, yet if ecclesiastical music
do really possess those many healing
virtues which at once betoken
its divine origin and heavenly mission,
it may be asked, is it a wise,
is it a self-distrusting, is it a pious
course for each individual to
imagine himself free from such an
authority? Is it not rather true
that, in proportion as his sense of
the heavenly mission of the ecclesiastical
chant deepens, the more
vivid will become his perception of
the need of an express living authority
to which the individual can
commit himself, in perfect confidence
that that song which a divinely
directed hierarchy shall put forth
and acknowledge as their own work,
will be sure to carry along with it
the blessing of God upon its use.</p>

<p>I do not see how a reasonable
person can refuse to admit that
such is the positive authority attaching
to the liturgical song-books,
and that it is to the devout and
skilful use of these books by her
own priests, cantors, and devout
people, that the church mainly
looks for the fulfilment of the divine
idea with respect to sacred
music. How otherwise will you
account for their existence? to
what purpose has the wisdom of
saints who contributed and collected
their contents been exerted?
Why has the church not let the
Gregorian system of music alone,
as she has the modern? why has
she formed a complete system and
body of song in the one, and not in
the other, if her work, when complete,
has no positive authority?
Or will the advocate of modern
art say, that this her work is defective
and superannuated; and that
it is time it should be locked up,
out of the way, in collections of antiquities,
and cease to be an offence
to ears polite? Yet, if such be the
case, an abrogation is not to be
presumed; it must be proved. But
the fact is, that the Council of
Trent caused the song-books to be
reissued, and directed the ecclesiastical
chant to be taught in the
seminaries of the clergy.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> And
when those very canonized saints,
of whose conditional approbation
of the use of modern art so very
much is made, came to the dignity
of obtaining a record in the church’s
song of her warriors departed, here
was surely a fit occasion, if, indeed
the church had abandoned her
former song, and disembarrassed
herself of its defective scale and
wearisome monotony, to call for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
the charms of modern art, that at
least it might be identified with its
votaries. Yet with this very natural
supposition contrast the fact
that the Ritual chant and its singers
continue year by year to hand on
the memory of the virtues of S.
Philip Neri and S. Charles Borromeo;
while for these, its supposed
patrons, modern art has not even a
little memorial. To the Ritual
song it leaves what would seem to
be to itself the unwelcome task of
keeping up the record of their sanctity
and their example.</p>

<p>Nor do I see to what purpose a
reference can be made to the anecdote
of Pope Marcellus’ approbation
of Palestrina’s composition,
since named <cite>Missa Papæ Marcelli</cite>,
with the view to establish an authority
for the system of modern
music; for the idea of deviation
from the order of the Ritual chant
once admitted to toleration, nothing
can be more natural than that
a pontiff, equally with any other
person, might come to express his
very high commendation of a particular
composition. And if we allow
that such a commendation is
not without its weight, it would
surely be a violent inference, singularly
betraying the absence of better
argument, if an instance of such
approbation of a particular work
were to be claimed as an <i lang="la">ex cathedra</i>
legislative authorization of a whole
system of music to which it cannot
be said to belong.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> For it should
not be forgotten that Palestrina’s
music is essentially different from
the existing system of modern art,
inasmuch as his works are either
mere harmonies upon the <cite>Canto
Fermo</cite>, or else consist of themes
borrowed from it, which frequently
preserve that distinct tonality of
the modes of the ecclesiastical
chant which modern art has quite
abandoned.</p>

<p>It has been objected, “that an
assertion that the church does not
authorize the use of modern harmony,
because she has not herself
furnished her children with any individual
compositions, is about as
reasonable a conclusion as the notion
that she does not authorize
and sanction sermons, because their
composition is left to the judgment,
good or bad, of private clergymen.”
But the objection fails, as there is a
total want of parity between the
office of singer and preacher. The
preacher passes through a long
course of training to the state of
priesthood, before he receives a license
to preach; and every person
in the church who has the license
to preach, is to be presumed to be
duly qualified both to make known
the divine law and recommend it
by his words and example. This is
not the case with the singer, who is
not necessarily even in the minor
orders, and whose duty is merely
to sing what is placed before him
correctly and with feeling. If the
education of the priests were left to
the same hazard and caprice that
would seem to be desired for the
choice of music for the church, it
is easy to imagine the result. But
very far from this, the most thoughtful
care is bestowed by the church
on the training of her future ministers:
obliged to fixed and unalterable
dogmas of the faith, versed in
one sacred volume, bound to one
uniform office of daily prayer and
pious reading, trained in an almost
uniform system of studies and external
discipline, the preacher
comes forth the living organ of a
divine system, fitted to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
spokesman of a kingdom that is
endowed with the power of drawing
its manifold materials to a concordant
and coherent system, and
moulding multiform and varied
minds to a unity of type and consistency
of action. “Such was the
strict subordination of the Catholic
Church,” says the historian Gibbon
(<cite>Hist.</cite>, ch. <span class="smcapuc">XX</span>.), “that the same
concerted sounds might issue at
once from a hundred pulpits of
Italy or Egypt, if they were tuned
by the master hand of the Roman
or Alexandrian primate.” Carry the
same principle of system and order
into the song of the church,
and it will be found impossible
to stop short of the Ritual chant-books.</p>

<p>2. With regard to the moral authority
of the chant: moral authority,
in the legislation of the church,
is ever a necessary companion of
any act of her legislative authority.
We should not, however, overlook
what seems to be a distinct element
of moral authority, in the historical
connection of the Ritual chant with
the generations now past and gone
to their rest. It was their song, the
song of saints long ago departed.
It is the song which S. Augustine
sang, and which drew forth his
tears: “Quantum flevi in hymnis
et canticis, suave sonantis ecclesiæ
tuæ vocibus commotus acriter;
voces illæ influebant auribus meis,
et eliquebatur veritas tua in cor
meum, et ex ea æstuabat. Inde
affectus pietatis, et currebant lacrymæ,
et bene mihi erat cum illis”&mdash;“How
often have these sacred
hymns and songs moved me to
tears, as I have been carried away
with the sweetly musical voices of
thy church. How these sounds
used to steal upon my ear, and thy
truth to pour itself into my heart,
which felt as if it were set on fire!
Then would come tender feelings
of devotion, my tears would flow,
and I felt that all was then well
with me” (<cite>Confess.</cite> lib. vi. cap. 6).
It was the song of S. Augustine,
the apostle of Saxon England, of
S. Stephen the Cistercian, and of
all the holy warriors of our Isle of
Saints. Nor is it only the song
which the saints sang, but it is the
song that sings of the saints&mdash;the
only song which cares to pour the
sweet odor of their memory over
the year, or to spread around them
its melodious incense, as they too
surround the throne of their Lord
and King.</p>

<p>Again: a moral authority attaches
to the Roman Ritual chant
in the very name <em>Gregorian</em>, by
which it is so generally known. S.
Gregory was the first to collect it
from the floating tradition in which
it existed in the church, and to
digest it into that body of annual
song for the celebration of the
Ritual which has come down to us.
This work came to be called after
him, <cite>Cantus Gregorianus</cite>, and forms
at this day the substance of the
Roman chant-books, enriched and
added to by the new offices and
Masses that have since then been
incorporated in the Ritual. Nothing
is known with any positive
historical certainty as to the authorship
of the several pieces in the
song-books; but as to the main
fact, that the music of the Ritual is
the work of the greatest saints of
the church&mdash;of the Popes Leo, Damasus,
Gelasius, and S. Gregory
himself&mdash;of many holy monks in
the retirement of their cloisters&mdash;history
leaves no doubt. This fact,
then, is beyond dispute: that the
Roman Ritual chant, which the
present inquiry concerns, is the
creation of the saints of the Roman
Church, for the decorum and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
solemnity of the public celebration
of the Liturgy.</p>

<p>And now, to come to the comparison:
if to the adequate realization
of the divine idea of sacred
song, as an instrument placed at
the disposal of the church, to aid in
carrying out her work of sanctification
and instruction, the notion
of a definite authority, both defining
what it should be, and prescribing
and regulating the manner of
its use, necessarily belongs, the
conclusion I think is that this authority
is found attaching itself to
the Ritual chant; and, from the
nature of the case, it is incapable
of attaching itself to the works of
modern music. First, because it
would seem to be an inseparable
principle as regards their use, that
every individual must be at liberty
to ask for or to demand their employment
according to his own
pleasure; and secondly, because a
positive authority can attach to
that alone which exists in a definite
and tangible shape, which is far
from being the case with the works
of modern music. They not only
do not form a definite collection,
but, such as they are, are subject to
perpetual change&mdash;that which is on
the surface to-day and admired, being
to-morrow nauseated and condemned;
and hence there is no
resting point whatever in them for
the idea of a positive authority.</p>

<p>And as regards the comparison
on the score of moral authority,
the attempt to draw it will, I fear,
touch upon delicate ground; for,
to confess the honest truth, it cannot
be drawn without bringing to
light the degeneracy of our popular
ideas respecting sacred music. Who
is there who seriously thinks of
claiming for the works of modern
music any connection with the
saints, past or present? or who is
there who either cares to ask for,
or to attribute any character of
sanctity to its authors? or would
even be likely to think very much
the more highly of the music if the
fact of its saintly origin could be
established? And what kind of
persons, for the most part, have its
authors been? Mozart died rejecting
the last sacraments; Beethoven
is supposed by his German biographer,
Schindler, to have been a
pantheist during the greater part
of his life; Rink was a Protestant;
Mendelssohn a Jew, who cared
very little for his Jewish faith; and
the different <i lang="it">maestri di capella</i> who
have been throughout Europe the
chief composers of these works,
were, for the most part, also the
directors of the theatres and opera-houses
of their royal patrons.</p>

<p>But enough has been said to
make it evident upon how different
a footing the chant of the Ritual
and the works of modern art respectively
stand, as regards moral
and ecclesiastical authority.</p>

<h4>RESPECTIVE CLAIM TO THE COMPLETENESS
AND ORDER OF A SYSTEM.</h4>

<p>The idea of a God Incarnate,
manifesting himself in the nature
of man on earth, necessarily contains
the idea of a system and order
displayed in his works. All apparent
system, it is true, does not
necessarily imply God as its author;
but absence of system and
its consequence, positive confusion
and disorder, is undeniably a sign
that the mind of the Almighty is
not there. If, then, the Catholic
Church be the kingdom of God
Incarnate, and the abiding-place of
his Spirit, it follows that her song is
a <em>system</em>, if God is at all to acknowledge
it in any respect of his own.
But the idea of system leads at once
to the Ritual song-books. Modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
art has not as yet furnished even
the necessary materials out of
which to construct a system, not to
speak of the hopelessness of forming
one, when the materials should
exist. Do but remove the Ritual
chant from the church, and you remove
a wonderful and perfect system,
which an order-loving mind
takes pleasure in contemplating&mdash;one
that moves with the ecclesiastical
year, that accompanies the Redeemer
from the annunciation of
his advent, the Ave Maria of his
coming in the flesh, to his birth,
his circumcision, his manifestation
to the Gentiles, his presentation
and discourse with the learned doctors
in the Temple, his miraculous
fast in the companionship of the
wild beasts in the wilderness, his
last entry into his own city, his
betrayal, his institution of the Holy
Eucharist, his agony in the garden,
his death upon the cross, his resurrection
from the dead, his ascension
into heaven&mdash;a system of song
which places around him, as jewels
in a crown, his chosen and sainted
servants, as the stars which God
set in the firmament of heaven to
give light upon the earth. <i lang="la">Cœli
enarrant gloriam Dei, et opera manuum
ejus annuntiat firmamentum</i>&mdash;“The
heavens declare the glory of
God, and the firmament showeth
his handiwork” (Ps. xviii.) Yet
if we saw the heavens only in the
way in which we are treated to the
performances of modern music, the
greater and the lesser light occasionally
changing places, after the
manner of the vicissitudes of Mozart
and Haydn, the planets moving out
of their orbits in indeterminate
succession, at the caprice of some
archangel, as the organist changes
his motets and introits, the Psalmist
would hardly have spoken of
the “<em>firmament showing God’s handiwork</em>.”
Where is there a trace of
order and system in the use of the
works of modern art? Where is
the musician who regards “duplex,”
“semiduplex,” or “simplex”? Mozart
in one church, Haydn in another,
Beethoven in a third, and a
host of others whose name is Legion,
taken like lots from a bag, as
whim or fancy may at the moment
direct, like the chaos described by
the poet, where</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Callida cum frigidis pugnant, humentia siccis,</div>
<div class="verse">Mollia cum duris, sine pondere habentia pondus.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&mdash;<cite>Ovid, Metam.</cite></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But to approach the comparison.
If in the divine idea of the Christian
song there is necessarily contained
the notion of a working and
efficient system, the simple truth is,
that there is no such system, either
in the works of modern music themselves,
or in the manner of their
use. On the one side is the important
fact, that the modern art
of music leaves the vastly larger
portion of the Ritual without any
music at all, embracing positively
not more than its merest fraction;
on the other, the equally great fact
of a total absence of any thing like
rule to determine their selection.
As a working system, then, full and
complete in all its points, the Ritual
chant stands alone the only realization
of that part of the divine idea
which contemplates order and system
in the use of Christian song.</p>

<h4>RESPECTIVE MORAL FITNESS: I. AS A SACRIFICIAL
SONG; II. AS A SONG FOR
THE OFFICES OF THE CHURCH.</h4>

<h5>I. <i>As a Sacrificial Song.</i></h5>

<p>It has been already remarked
that ecclesiastical song is not everything
or anything that is beautiful
in music, nor merely a work of art.
It is, strictly speaking, a sacrificial
chant, the song of those engaged in
offering sacrifice to God, <i lang="la">Tibi sacrificabo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
hostiam laudis</i>. Such a song
is obviously not any kind of song,
but one that possesses a moral type
and character, rendering it a fit
companion for the holy and bloodless
victim offered on the Christian
altar; becoming an offering, offered
not to man, but to the ears of the
Most High, and akin to the solemnity
of its subject&mdash;redemption from
sin and death through the blood
and sufferings of a sinless victim,
the crucified Son of God. The divine
idea may then, I think, be said
to contemplate sacred song as possessing
a sacrificial character.</p>

<p>And the reason, if required, will
appear, on considering to how great
an extent music possesses the remarkable
gift of absorbing and becoming
possessed with an idea.
When song has been successfully
united to language, the ideas contained
in the latter are found to
take possession of the music, and
to form the sound or tune into an
image and reflection of themselves,
in a manner almost analogous to
the way in which the mind within
moulds the outward features of the
face, so as to make them an index
and expression of itself. What I
mean by this alleged power of music
to absorb, and afterwards to express,
ideas, even those the most
opposite to each other, may be exemplified,
if an instance be wanted,
by contrasting any popular melody
from the Roman Gradual, as the
<cite>Dies Iræ</cite>, or the <cite>Stabat Mater</cite>, with
one of our popular street tunes,
“Cherry ripe,” or “Jim Crow”;
and it will be seen at once, on humming
over these tunes, with what
perfect truth and to how great an
extent music is able to ally itself
to the most opposite ideas, and
how, through the ear, it has the
power, not merely to convey them
to the mind, but to leave them there,
firmly and vividly impressed. If,
then, by virtue of this power, music
may, on the one hand, become the
channel of the most exquisite profaneness
in divine worship, so it
certainly may, on the other, contribute
wonderfully to its majesty
and power of attraction. And
since the music of the field of battle,
the military march, and the roll
of the drum, has a character not
shared by other kinds, as the song
of the banquet, and of the dance,
of the drunkard over his cups, of
the peasant at his plough, of the
sailor at sea, of the village maiden
at her home, have each their own
stamp and form: so also in the
song of Christian worship, God will
regard it as the song of men offering
sacrifice to himself, as having a
character inherent in its subject&mdash;the
life, sufferings, and death of
him who died to take away the sins
of the world&mdash;in a word, as a sacrificial
chant.</p>

<p>Now that a sacrificial chant has
in all ages accompanied the offering
of sacrifice, is a truth to which
history, if examined, will be found
to bear abundant testimony. In
the sacrifice described by Virgil in
the Æneid,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent4">“pueri innuptæque puellæ</div>
<div class="verse">Sacra canunt.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When, at the command of Nehemias,
on the return of the captive
Jews from Babylon, sacrifice was
solemnly offered after their custom
in Jerusalem, the priests, it is said
(2 Machab. i. 30), <em>sang psalms until
the burnt-offering was wholly consumed</em>.
Nor is it the whole truth
to say that this sacrificial chant has
passed over in its more perfect reality
to the Christian Church, but
even in the Song of Heaven among
the redeemed, the sacrificial character
still continues, a point well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
worthy of the notice of those who
are so confident that the type of
the modern music is alone that
which is found in heaven. “And
they [the twenty-four ancients] sang
a new song, saying, Thou art worthy
to take the book and open the
seals thereof, for thou wast slain,
and hast redeemed us to God by
thy blood, out of every kindred,
and tongue, and people, and nation.”</p>

<p>If, then, the ideas which suggest
themselves and arise naturally on
reflecting upon what, in the nature
of things, would be the type and
character of the Christian sacrificial
chant; if these ideas find themselves
absorbed, then expressed,
embodied, and brought out into
life and being in the music of the
ecclesiastical chant; and if, on the
other hand, they are not to be found
in the variety of modern compositions
such as are now in partial
use;<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> if it be possible to conceive
our Lord’s apostles, upon the supposition
that they could return to
the earth, standing up in any church
of Christendom to sing the song
of the Ritual in honor of the Holy
Sacrifice, and in company with the
celebrant priest;<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> and if there be
something obviously unbecoming
in the mere thought of their taking
bass or tenor in such music as that
of Mozart’s or Haydn’s masses,
neither of which will be denied;
then, I think, it is not extravagant
to infer that the Plain Chant of the
Ritual is far the most adequate fulfilment
of that part of the divine
idea which contemplates Christian
music as a sacrificial song.</p>

<h5>II. <i>Fitness for the Offices of the
Church.</i></h5>

<p>With regard to the fitness of the
ecclesiastical chant for the offices
of the church, it must be remarked,
that the ideas of the modern musician
touching the use of music in
the church are very widely removed
from those of the fathers of the
church. In their idea, a church-singer
would somewhat answer to
what would be a ballad-singer in
the world, inasmuch as he has a
great deal to convey to his hearers
in the way of narrative. Almighty
God has been pleased to work many
wonderful works, and the fathers
of the church appointed singers for
the churches, to celebrate these
works in song, in order that the
people who came to worship, or
even the heathens who came as
spectators, might hear and learn
something of the works of the Lord
Jehovah, into whose house they
had come. What can be more reasonable
than this? “<em>My song shall
be of all thy marvellous works</em>,” says
the Psalmist. But, according to
the notions of a modern musician,
if a Brahmin priest, or the Turkish
ambassador, were to come to Mass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
and to hear a choral performance,
in which the concord of voices
should be most ravishingly beautiful,
but in which not a single one of
the marvellous works of God could
be understood from the concert, he
is still to consider that he has heard
the perfection of Christian music,
and ought, according to them, to go
away converted. Out of two so
contradictory notions one must necessarily
be chosen as the one
which best answers to the divine
idea. And if persons are prepared
to say that the ideas of the fathers
are become antiquated, and that
they would have acted differently
had they known better, they are
certainly called upon to make this
good.</p>

<p>But, in the meantime, it will be
both reasonable and pious to acquiesce
in the belief that the fathers
acted in conformity with the divine
idea, and under the direction of
God’s Holy Spirit, in appointing a
song for the church, in which the
marvellous and merciful works of
God might be set forth in a charming,
becoming, and perfectly intelligible
manner, for the instruction of
the people. A serious person, when
he goes into the house of God, is
supposed to go there with the intention
of learning something respecting
God, and it is to be supposed
that Almighty God desires
to see every church in such a condition
as that the people who frequent
it may learn all that they
need to know respecting God and
his works. To this use the fathers
employed chant, and considered
that it was, by the will of God, to
be employed to this end. If any
candid and serious person will take
the trouble to examine the language
and sentiments of the Ritual apart
from its musical notation, he will
be struck with it as a complete
manual of popular theology. He
will see that it is full of the works
of God, the knowledge of which is
the food of the faithful soul, particularly
among the poor and the
unlearned. Next let him examine
its notation in song, as contained in
the Gradual and Antiphonary, and
he will be struck with a solemnity,
beauty, and force of melody fitted
to convey to the people the words
of inspiration, to which melody was
annexed in order that they might
be the better relished, and pass
current the more easily. And lastly,
let him consider them, in both
these respects, as forming one
united whole, and he cannot refuse
to acknowledge the fitness of
the chant which the fathers selected
for the purpose they had in
view. Musicians must be equitable
enough to abstain from complaining
of a work on the score of its
unisonous recitative character, if
they will not be at the pains to understand
or to sympathize with the
end for which it was formed and
destined. Have the fathers ever
troubled themselves to criticise
what was innocent and allowable
in the world’s music? Then why
should musicians go out of the way
to find imaginary faults with that
of which they seem indisposed to
consider either the use or the efficacy?
The church chant was
framed generations before they and
their art were known; and it has
helped to train up whole nations in
the faith, and fulfilled its end to the
unbounded satisfaction of the fathers,
who adopted, enlarged, and
consolidated it into the form in
which it has come down to us, and
may therefore claim a truce to such
criticism.</p>

<p>But here, again, the comparison
fails for want of a competitor, and
we are again brought back to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
fact that the works of modern art
embrace too small a fraction of the
whole Liturgy to be in a condition
to challenge any comparison. And
could the comparison be admitted,
it would still remain to insist on the
equally certain truth of experience
that the idea of a lengthened and
continual recitation of the works of
God, intended to be popularly intelligible,
is one unsuited to the
employment on any great scale of
even the simplest counterpoint
vocal harmonies, and fundamentally
averse to the prevailing use of
the canon and fugue of modern
musical science.</p>

<h4>RESPECTIVE FITNESS TO PASS AMONG THE
PEOPLE AS A CONGREGATIONAL SONG.</h4>

<p>Upon this point of the comparison
the result, I think, will be tolerably
obvious, if it be admitted
that the divine idea contemplates
the chant of the church as designed
to pass to some considerable extent
among the people in the form of
congregational singing. It will
not, however, be out of place to
show briefly on what grounds this
assumption rests.</p>

<p>1. Almighty God has created in
people a strong love for congregational
psalmody, and has attached
to it peculiar feelings possessed
of an influence far more powerful
for good than the somewhat isolated
pleasure that the musician feels
on hearing beautiful artificial music,
inasmuch as congregational
singing is a common voice of prayer
and praise; and being, as Christians,
members one of another, in
congregational psalmody we gain a
foretaste of heaven, where it will
be far more perfect.</p>

<p>2. There are obvious benefits
arising from it. It is an union of
prayer and praise, and as such is
more powerful with God. It kindles
in the individual a livelier
sense of Christian fellowship. It
is a voice that expresses the union
of the many members in the one
body; many voices, one sound.</p>

<p>3. The argument from history.
The worship of God has always
been that of congregational psalmody;
and where trained choirs of
singers existed, their song was always
such as to admit of the people
at times taking part with them.
This is an undeniable fact of history.
“Then sang <em>Moses and the
children of Israel</em> this song unto
the Lord” (Exodus xv.) “Then
<em>sang Israel</em> this song, Spring up,
O well, sing ye unto it, etc.”
(Numbers xxi. 17). The psalm
<span class="smcapuc">CXXXV.</span> was composed for the people
to sing the chorus. The Book
of Psalms is a kind of historical
testimony, in many of its passages,
to the fact of that congregational
song to which it so often exhorts.
Fleury, in his <cite>History of the Manners
of the Jews and Christians</cite>
(page 143), acknowledges congregational
song as a fact among both.
He cites the testimony of S.
Basil, that all the people in his time
sang in the churches&mdash;men, women,
and children&mdash;and he compares
their voices to the waters of the
sea. S. Gregory of Nazianzen
compares them to thunder. But it
is impossible to conceive such to
have been the practice both of
Jews and Christians, without inferring
that it was so with the approbation
of Almighty God.</p>

<p>4. The apostles and the fathers
of the church have sanctioned it.
“Teaching and admonishing yourselves
in psalms and hymns and
spiritual songs, singing with melody
in your hearts unto the Lord”
(Col. iii. 16).</p>

<p>“Wherefore, since these things
are so, let us with the more confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
give ourselves to the work
of song, considering that we have
obtained a great grace of Almighty
God, to whom it has been given, in
company with so many and so great
saints, the prophets, and the martyrs,
to celebrate the marvellous
works of the eternal God.”&mdash;<cite>An
old author in the first volume of Gerbert’s
Scriptores Musici.</cite></p>

<p>“Quocunque te vertis, arator
stivam tenens Alleluia decantat,
sudans messor Psalmis se evocat,
et curva attollens vitem falce vinator
aliquid Davidicum cantat.
Hæc sunt in provincia nostra carmina,
hæc ut vulgo dicitur amatoriæ
cantationes, hic pastorum sibilus,
hæc arma culturæ.”&mdash;“Wherever
you turn, the laborer at his plough
sings an alleluia; the reaper sweating
under his work refreshes himself with
a psalm: the vinedresser in his vineyard
will sing a passage from the
Psalmist. These are the songs of
our part of the world. These are,
as people say, our love-songs. This
is the piping of our shepherds, and
these are the arms of our laborers.”&mdash;<cite>S.
Jerome, Epist. 17 ad Marcellum.</cite></p>

<p>“Alas!” observes Mgr. Parisis,
upon this passage of S. Jerome,
“where are now the families who
seek to enliven the often dangerous
leisure of long winter’s evenings
with the songs of the Catholic Liturgy;
where are the workshops in
which an accent may be heard borrowed
from the remembrance of
our divine offices; where are the
country parishes which are edified
and rejoiced by the sweet and pious
sounds which in the times of S.
Jerome echoed through the fields
and vineyards?”<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>S. Augustine: “As for congregational
psalmody, what better employment
can there be for a congregation
of people met together,
what more beneficial to themselves,
or more holy and well-pleasing to
God, I am wholly unable to conceive?”&mdash;<cite>Letter
to Januarius, towards
the end.</cite></p>

<p>A passage of S. Chrysostom, exhorting
the people to psalmody,
will be found elsewhere. It is unnecessary
to do more than to refer
to the example of S. Basil and
S. Ambrose, encouraging their people
in the same manner; to which
may be added a passage from the
life of S. Germanus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Pontificis monitis, psallit plebs, clerus et infans.”</p>

<p class="right"><cite>Venantius, vita S. Germani.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Lastly, the <em>moral</em> reason of the
thing.</p>

<p>This is expressed by S. Basil in
the words: “O wonderful wisdom
of the teacher! who hath contrived
that we <em>should both sing</em>, and therewith
learn that which is good.”</p>

<p>Now, if it be considered that
Providence could not possibly have
meant that the people at large
should be formed into singing
classes, in order to be initiated into
the mysteries of minim and crotchet,
tenor and bass, and that the <em>one</em>
only practical means of bringing
them to pick up by ear the more
popular parts of the church chant
is by encouraging, as the system of
the Ritual chant does, that clear
enunciation of language and melody
which easily fixes itself upon the
ear, and which the prevalence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
unison singing gives;<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> it follows at
once that the only hope of procuring
general congregational singing
in the worship of the Catholic
Church lies in the increased use and
zealous propagation of the unison
execution of the Ritual chant. Experience
is clear to the point that
the use of the works of modern art,
with their rapid movements, elaborate
fugues, scientific combinations
of sound, necessarily tends to stifle
the voices of the people, and this is
certainly not the will of our merciful
God.</p>

<p>Now, if this be the case, I do not
see how we are to avoid the conclusion,
that any extensive use of these
works of modern art tends to the
clear frustration and the making
void one great and important popular
end, viz., congregational singing,
which the divine idea contemplates
in the song of the church,
and which, in the song of the Ritual,
is efficiently realized, as the history
of the progress of the faith abundantly
testifies. Might it not, then, be
well that those who advocate the
continued cultivation of these elaborate
works of art should consider
the full meaning of Mardocheus’
prayer, <i lang="la">Ne claudas ora te canentium</i>:
“Shut not the mouth of them that
sing thy praise, O Lord” (Esther
xiii. 17).</p>

<h4>RESPECTIVE MORAL INFLUENCE IN THE
FORMATION OF CHARACTER.</h4>

<p>The influence upon the mind of
sounds that habitually surround
the ear is a fact well known to all
moralists. “Whosoever,” says Plato,
in his treatise <cite>De Republicâ</cite>, quoted
by Gerbert, “is in the habit of
permitting himself to listen habitually
to music, and to allow his
mind to be engaged and soothed
by it, pouring in the sweet sounds
before alluded to through the ears,
as through an orifice, soft, soothing,
luscious, and plaintive, consuming
his life in tunes that fascinate his
soul; when he does this to an excess,
he then begins to weaken, to
unstring, and to enervate his understanding,
until he loses his
courage, and roots all vigor out of
the mind.” Cicero observes, “Nihil
tam facile in animos teneros
atque molles influere quam varios
canendi sonos, quorum vix dici
potest quanta sit vis in utramque
partem; namque et incitat languentes,
et languefacit excitatos, et tum
remittit animos, tum contrahit”
(lib. ii. <cite>De Legibus</cite>). These remarks
seem very much to have
their exemplification at this day in
the effeminate tone and temper of
polished society in all the nations
of Europe, who seem to be befooled
with their love for pretty airs and
opera music. Now, if the fathers,
observing this power of music insensibly
to mould and form the
character, and acting, as it is more
than pious to believe, under the
guidance of the Holy Spirit, that
his divine intention might be fulfilled,
designed the song of the church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
to form a character very different
from that of the musical voluptuary&mdash;one
who was to be no cowardly
skulker from the good fight of faith,
but the soldier of Jesus Christ, the
disciple patiently taking up his cross
and following his crucified Master&mdash;those
who do not participate in
these ideas ought not to wonder
that they find so little in the church
chant with which they can sympathize;
but above all let them at
least have the modesty not to blame
the fathers of the church for adapting
it, after their wisdom, to a purpose
the need for which they do
not comprehend. The historian
Fleury has a pertinent remark:
“Je laisse à ceux qui sont savants
en musique à examiner si dans
notre Plain Chant il reste encore
quelque trace de cette antiquité [he
is speaking of the force of character
of the old chant]; car notre
musique moderne semble en être
fort eloignée” (Fleury, <cite>Mœurs des
Chrétiens</cite>, page xliii.)&mdash;“I leave to
those who are versed in music to determine
whether there remain any
traces of this ancient vigor in our
Plain Chant; for our modern music
seems very far from it.”</p>

<p>Is it a thing to be wondered at
if the Christian Israel’s Song of
the Cross should have in it something
a little strange to the ear of
Babylon? Or are we to content
ourselves with the conclusion that
nothing but what is dainty and
nice, nothing but that which is as
nearly like the world as possible,
will go down with Christian people?
On the contrary, is it not to be presumed
that the multitudes, with
whom, in the main, the Christian
teacher’s duty lies, are of that sickly,
degenerate tone of mind that
nauseates the strong, peculiar, and
supplicating energy of the ecclesiastical
chant?</p>

<p>But on this point the comparison
may be drawn in the words of
Mgr. Parisis:</p>

<p>“External to the Ritual chant,
that is to say, the Gregorian, or
Plain Chant, little else is now known
except the works of modern music,
that is to say, a music essentially
favoring what people have agreed
to call <em>sensualism</em>. It is this, almost
exclusively this, which, under the
austere title of sacred music, is
sought to be introduced into our
sacred offices. Now, without desiring
to enter deeply into the matter,
we need but few words to point
out how grievously it is misplaced.</p>

<p>“Worldly music agitates and
seeks to agitate, because the world
seeks its pleasure in stir and change.
The church, on the contrary, seeks
for melodies that pray and incline
to prayer. The church cannot
wish for any others, since her worship
has no other object than
prayer.</p>

<p>“In vain will it be said that this
is the work of one of the greatest
masters, that it is a scientific and a
sublime composition; it may be all
this for the world&mdash;it is nothing at
all of this for the church. And especially
when this worldly music,
by its thrilling cadences or impassioned
character, leads directly to
light ideas, sensual satisfactions,
and dangerous recollections, it is
not only a contradiction in the
house of God, but a formal scandal.”

<h3>A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.</h3>

<p>It is now many years since, during
a summer ramble, I found myself
at A&mdash;&mdash;k, now nothing more
than a hamlet in population, but
retaining traces of having once
been a place of very considerable
importance, and boasting of very remote
antiquity. The remains of
the wall are, indeed, locally attributed
to the Romans, probably because
they are lofty and very strong,
and it is the habit of ignorant people
to refer all great works to that
wonderful people. In this instance,
however, tradition is certainly
wrong, as the walls bear unmistakable
evidence of mediæval origin,
being in parts much enriched with
Gothic work.</p>

<p>The little town stands on a plateau
enclosed between a bend of
the Rhine and the steep bluff on
which the ruins of an old castle stand
perched, equally watching the little
burgh below and the counterpart
castle on the opposite side of the
Rhine at its next bend.</p>

<p>The eagles that once lived in
and sought their prey from that
lofty nest have long since crumbled
into dust and have even passed
from the memory of man, leaving
for sole representatives the choughs
and the crows, and perhaps a jolly
old owl to keep up revelry at night.</p>

<p>The horses that those old knights
rode must have been of a sure-footed
breed, for it is hard to conceive
how any quadruped, save a
goat, could have mounted the path
I scrambled up among the vines;
but it is with the village and the
village church that we have to do.</p>

<p>Who built the Rhine churches?</p>

<p>They all, with a few exceptions,
are strikingly alike; though varying
in size, number of towers, and many
other particulars, they have mostly
a strict resemblance in general conception
and detail. To cite an instance:
The cathedral at Coblentz
might stand as the type of twenty
others; instead of being individual
and standing out alone&mdash;an effort
of genius like Cologne, Strasbourg,
Notre Dame, Ely, or Winchester&mdash;they
have all the same resemblance
to one another that a little oak has
to a big one.</p>

<p>The church at A&mdash;&mdash;k was no exception.
Cathedral it might almost
be called from its great size; but
there was no bishop there, and it
was only a parish church! With
its three great towers, vast nave,
long aisles, and noble choir, it
seemed as if it might well hold all
the population for many miles
around, and the extremely small
congregation that were present at
the celebration of the High Mass
that morning appeared ridiculously
out of proportion. It was a high
festival&mdash;the Annunciation&mdash;it is
therefore to be assumed that the
bulk of the population were there,
and the High Mass was at the somewhat
early hour of half-past five!</p>

<p>After the Mass was over, and the
last peal of the organ had died away,
and the patter of the last footstep
been lost in the distance, as it still
wanted a considerable time to my
breakfast hour, I strolled round the
great empty church. There seemed
to be nothing of value in it. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
it had ever possessed any of the
treasures of art, they had probably
perished or been carried away during
the long wars that devastated
the country after the period of the
Reformation, for I found nothing
worthy of notice. I had just concluded
to leave the church when my
eye was arrested by what I took to
be an accident which had happened
to the crucifix on one of the side
altars. At first I supposed that it
had received a blow which had
nearly broken off the right arm
of the figure. On looking more
closely I perceived that it was evidently
of great age, and the arm
I supposed to be broken stood out
from the cross at a considerable
angle, and hung about half way
down the side, the nail by which it
had once been attached still remaining
in the hand.</p>

<p>Whilst I was still wondering as
to the nature of the accident which
had befallen the quaintly-carved
crucifix a quiet and pleasant voice
roused me from my revery.</p>

<p>“I see, sir, that you are examining
our curious old crucifix!”</p>

<p>Turning round I recognized the
old priest who had sung Mass, and
encouraged by his amiable manner
and address, I stated the matter I
had been pondering over, and asked
for an explanation.</p>

<p>“There has been no accident,”
said he; “the distortion which you
notice in the right arm has existed
far beyond the memory of man.</p>

<p>“The figure is carved out of some
very hard wood, and all out of a
single block&mdash;there being no joining
in any part of it.”</p>

<p>Still more astonished, I asked
what could have been the motive
of representing the Saviour in so
strange an attitude; the more, as the
hole for the nail still remaining in
the hand was still to be seen plainly
in the wood, whilst the hand was
in the position in which it would
have been had it just struck a blow.</p>

<p>“That is a curious story, and is, in
fact, the only legend I know of
connected with this church.</p>

<p>“The crucifix is held in great reverence,
and people come from great
distances to pray before it. As I
see you are a stranger, perhaps you
will partake of an old man’s breakfast,
whilst you listen to him as he
relates the traditional story, which
being connected with this church,
where he has grown old, he regards
as almost peculiarly his own. Besides,
the story is too long to be
listened to either standing or fasting.”</p>

<p>Thanking the good priest for his
kind offer, I followed him into the
little presbytery almost adjoining
the church, where we were soon
seated on each side of a little table
taking off the edge of our appetites
with eggs, coffee, and rolls.</p>

<p>When we had somewhat appeased
our craving, the good man commenced,
saying:</p>

<p>“The tradition of which I have
to speak dates back a long way, and
has at least so much of authenticity
about it as attaches to the undoubted
antiquity of the crucifix itself,
and to the fact that, for many generations
at least, no other account
has been current.</p>

<p>“My grandfather used to tell it to
me when an infant on his knee,
and said that he had heard it from
his grandfather in the same way.</p>

<p>“In which of the many wars which
have scourged this unfortunate
land since the rebel monk Luther
brought the curse of religious dissension
upon it, the circumstances
which I am about to relate occurred,
I am unable to determine; for
the traditions, which agree in all
other points, differ on this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span></p>

<p>“On the whole I incline to the one
which places these events during
the period of Gustavus Adolphus’
invasion, and attribute them to the
particular band which was led by
his lieutenant Oxenstiern, who certainly
did sack the place. This
would place it at more than two
hundred years ago, and it certainly
is not more recent.</p>

<p>“At that period there lived in
A&mdash;&mdash;k a widow and her daughter.
They were very poor, belonging to
the peasant class, and supported
themselves in winter by spinning;
and when the spring came round,
they would go off to the steep
mountain-sides, where they helped
to dress the vines or gather the
vintage, according to the season.</p>

<p>“They never went to distant vineyards,
because the mother, having in
her youth met with a severe accident,
was unable, from its effects, to
walk far. There was also another
reason: for Gretchen, who was the
prettiest girl for many miles around,
was also the best, and never failed,
winter or summer, to hear Mass
and to spend some time in prayer
before that very crucifix which has
attracted your attention.</p>

<p>“There was, no doubt, some older
tradition about its origin, for it had
a great reputation for sanctity even
then; this tradition, whatever it
may have been, seems, however, to
have been swallowed up by the overwhelming
interest of the subsequent
event, which I am about to
relate.</p>

<p>“All accounts agree that when
Gretchen first worshipped there
the crucifix had nothing unusual
about it to distinguish it from any
other, except its artistic merit.</p>

<p>“The hand was then nailed to the
cross. There, however, kneeling in
front of it, wrapped in prayer, this
young girl spent all the time she
could spare from the humble duties
of her life.</p>

<p>“She milked the cow, the one valuable
possession of her mother,
who had the right of common; she
washed the clothes, cooked and
did the work about her mother’s
house, and acted as her crutch
as she climbed the steep paths
of the vineyard&mdash;for, in spite of
her lameness, she was a skilful vinedresser&mdash;in
short, she was all in
all to her only parent.</p>

<p>“With all this labor and care Gretchen
grew in grace and beauty;
and though so devout, she was as
bright and cheerful and winning in
her ways as the most worldly of her
young companions.</p>

<p>“Never, however, could she be
tempted to go to any of the merry-makings
or harvest-homes or vintage
feasts that were held at a distance;
her invariable answer was,
‘My mother cannot walk so far.’</p>

<p>“She had many suitors; and admirers
came from a great distance.</p>

<p>“To all Gretchen was equally
kind and considerate; but to none
did she show any sort of preference,
so that all the youths for
many miles on both sides of the
Rhine were pulling caps for her.</p>

<p>“Thus things went on till she was
nineteen, when, to the great surprise
of all, she was seen to take
up with and give a decided preference
to the attentions of a young
stranger who had been in the place
only a few weeks.</p>

<p>“The favored youth was a journeyman
clockmaker from Nuremberg,
who was going through his
year of wandering, and was at the
moment settled in the town, working
for the only tradesman in his
line of business in the place.</p>

<p>“A&mdash;&mdash;k was then much more
populous, as you may well suppose,
being able to support such a trade.</p>

<p>“This youth, whose name was
Gotliebe Hunning, was handsome
and showy, wearing his hair in long
locks down his back, and spending
much of his earnings in dress. He
sung, played the guitar, and was reputed
wild, though no harm could
be alleged against him.</p>

<p>“The old folks shook their heads,
and deplored that so sweet and
modest a girl as Gretchen should
be seen so much with a roisterer
like Gotliebe.</p>

<p>“Somehow it had been no sin to
sing and be gay like God’s unreasoning
creatures before the sour times
of Calvin, Huss, and Luther; but
though their errors had not penetrated
here to any great extent,
something of their acid had been
imparted to the leaven of life.</p>

<p>“So things were, however, and all
the time that Gretchen gave to
pleasure&mdash;which was little enough,
poor child, for they were very poor
and her mother was very helpless&mdash;she
spent with this handsome, clever
youth; not that she abandoned her
devotion, or was less frequently
prostrated before the crucifix; for
indeed, if possible, she was found
there more than ever. Still, the
gossips shook their heads and remarked
upon it.</p>

<p>“One would say, ‘Ah! I never
trusted that meek manner of hers.
I always knew she would surprise
us some day, and here it is! It is
always so with the very good ones!’
‘Ay, ay,’ her neighbor would say,
‘cat will after cream! And Eve
has left her mark upon the best of
them! The girl is a girl like other
young things; but I did hope better
things of Gretchen, so well
brought up as she has been!’&mdash;thus
they ran on.</p>

<p>“Soon, however, it began to be said
that Gotliebe was sobering down;
he frequented the tavern less, never
danced except with Gretchen, sang
less and worked more.</p>

<p>“He was admitted to be a master
of his craft, and when it became
known that he was engaged in all
his leisure hours in making a great
clock&mdash;the very one the chimes of
which you were admiring&mdash;for the
church, there was less head-shaking,
and more talk about Gretchen’s
luck in making so great a
catch. Still he made no change in
his showy dress, and indeed I think
that genius, at least in art, often
shows itself in that way, and tradition
testifies that he was no mean
proficient in the art he practised,
of which indeed we still have proof
every hour.</p>

<p>“Then it began to be observed
that Gotliebe was frequently in the
church with Gretchen, and had become
a regular attendant at Mass.
Still, things went on in the same
way and no betrothal was spoken
of, until, after the war had again
broken out and seemed to be drifting
this way, it suddenly became
known that Gretchen had consented
to be married to Gotliebe without
loss of time, and that he was to
take a house and her mother was
to move into it.</p>

<p>“In this remote place, far from any
of the great avenues of trade&mdash;for
vessels usually passed it by, no
great roads branching off here, and
there being no steamboats invented&mdash;news
came doubtfully and seldom,
and war was at the very door
at a moment when only distant
rumors had reached A&mdash;&mdash;k.</p>

<p>“However, to return to Gretchen
and Gotliebe: You may be sure
that what goes on now went on
then, and that all the busybodies
were agog as to what they were to
live upon; how she was to be dressed,
and who were to be the bridemaids;
but as the world spins round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
in spite of the flies that buzz about
it, so they went their way regardless
of all that was said about
them.</p>

<p>“In the meantime, the rumors
grew more frequent and more particular
concerning the cloud of war
which was every day drifting nearer
and nearer, until the dark mass
seemed ready at any moment to
burst upon the unfortunate village
itself.</p>

<p>“Indeed, news came from neighboring
towns and villages that they
had been taken and burned by the
heretic Swedes, and tales, no doubt
often exaggerated, of the violent
and dissolute conduct of Oxenstiern’s
troopers, kept every one in
terror.</p>

<p>“Affairs were in this threatening
condition when the wedding-morning
came; and, as the story was,
though Gretchen had little to spend
on dress, no art and no expense
could have produced a lovelier
bride than stood before the altar of
the Crucifix that morning. She
wore nothing but a simple dress of
white, and a wreath of apple-blossoms,
for the trees were just then
in flower.</p>

<p>“The wedding-bells were ringing,
and the humble bridal-party had
just reached the house which Gotliebe
had taken, when cannon were
heard, and a band of fierce Swedish
soldiers rushed into the village.</p>

<p>“The firing proceeded from an
attack upon the castle, which still
stands at about a mile from this
place, and the invaders of the village
were army followers and a few
of the more dissolute of Oxenstiern’s
soldiery, who, encountering
the bridal-party, at once interrupted
its progress, treating the bridemaids
rudely; and one of them,
who threw his arms around Gretchen,
was immediately struck down by
Gotliebe, who, as before said, was a
spirited youth.</p>

<p>“One of the invaders, without a
moment’s hesitation, struck him
lifeless, and attempted to seize the
bride, who, with a shriek, fled and
took refuge in the church.</p>

<p>“Thither Gretchen was pursued
by the band; and when after many
hours the troops were withdrawn,
and the priest, with a few of the
boldest of his flock, ventured into
the sacred edifice, they found the
high altar desecrated, the sacred
vessels gone, and other sacrileges
committed, which filled them with
horror; but on turning to the altar
of the Crucifix, they found the bride
prostrate before it, either in a trance
or ecstasy, with the soldier who had
pursued her lying with his skull
broken, and his iron head-piece
smashed in as though a sledge-hammer
had struck it, and the arm
of the crucifix distorted as you see
it now.</p>

<p>“On being questioned, the young
widow could only say: ‘God has
protected me!’</p>

<p>“The poor mother only lingered
a day or two afterwards, and was
borne to the grave at the same time
as the unfortunate Gotliebe.</p>

<p>“Gretchen never knew, or would
not say, more than I have repeated
of what had occurred at the altar
of the Crucifix. It was unplundered!</p>

<p>“The people, however, all said
that God, who had borne the insults
and profanation directed against
himself at the high altar, had interposed
when the virtue of a pure
virgin was threatened, and had
himself, by the hand of his image,
smitten the would-be violator dead,
leaving the distorted arm as an admonition
for ever.”</p>

<p>We were both silent after this recital,
and for some moments toyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
with the fragments of our breakfast.</p>

<p>At length, raising my head, I
asked: “And you, father&mdash;do you
believe this tale?”</p>

<p>A sweet, soft smile hovered about
his lips, as he replied: “Nothing
in which the goodness of God is
instanced is hard for me to believe!
He is less ready to show
his anger, so that, though we live in
the midst of his wonders, we have
got so used to them that it is said
that there are those who deny his
existence.”</p>

<p>This was said as if to himself.
Then, speaking more collectedly,
he continued:</p>

<p>“You English would rather believe
in ghosts and devils than in
the good God. Whence do you
suppose they derive their existence
and their power?”</p>

<p>I assured him that I was of the
same faith as himself, and only asked
because I wished to have the
opinion of a cultivated man on the
subject of this particular legend,
which had greatly interested me,
and of which there remained so
singular an evidence.</p>

<p>After a moment’s pause, he said:</p>

<p>“Think of the facts yourself, sir.
This tradition, which is certainly
very old, is either true in its main
features or it was made to fit the
crucifix. Assume this last to be the
case, how did so singular an image
come into existence? Made to
hang the tradition upon? Scarcely
in so small a community, where
all must have known each other.
Besides, it is a work of art, and I
have been told that as such it is of
rare merit. Such a work could
hardly have been produced for an
unworthy object, and would have
been difficult to substitute for one
of inferior workmanship. If I called
it a legend, it is because it has an
air of romance about it. But God
is good, and does what he pleases!”</p>

<p>I had nothing more to say; so I
asked what had become of Gretchen,
and was told that she had been
taken as a lay sister in the small
convent at the head of the valley,
whence she had continued, to the
very day of her death, to come and
pray at the foot of the crucifix,
where in fact she was at last found
dead, in her eighty-seventh year,
and that during the whole time she
had been regarded as a saint.</p>

<p>“The altar,” he resumed, “is
universally regarded with great
reverence, and is always spoken
of as the Altar of Succor to a
very considerable distance up and
down the Rhine, and the unusual
number of models in wax or wood
which you see hanging before it
indicate how special favors are
reputed to have been granted
there.”</p>

<p>“I noticed them,” I replied,
“when first I entered Belgium,
where I saw many. I was much
struck with what I thought the
singular idea of offering a leg
in wax to obtain the cure of lameness,
an eye for blindness, and so
on.”</p>

<p>“I perceive, sir,” said the good
priest, “that you have fallen into
the error of mistaking cause for
effect. These models and tokens
are in no case hung before the altar
until after the cure prayed for has
been effected, when it is the pious
custom of the people to commemorate
the blessing they have received&mdash;much
as one out of the ten
lepers cured by our Lord did&mdash;by
showing gratitude, that all may see
what he has done for them.</p>

<p>“Some of these emblems,” continued
he, “have curious histories
attached to them, whose events
have occurred under my own eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will give you one instance
only, not to be tedious.</p>

<p>“Did you notice a small bottle
amongst the objects we speak
of?”</p>

<p>I acknowledged that I had not
done so, having paid little attention
to them.</p>

<p>“Well, there is one there at all
events, which I myself attached to
the bunch, under the following circumstances:</p>

<p>“Some years ago, two brothers,
both young men, were leaving a
wharf some miles up the river, at
twilight. The steamer having landed
its passengers, was on the point
of starting, when the elder of the
two remonstrated with his brother
upon the condition in which he
found him; in fact, the youth was
addicted to drinking, and gave
much trouble to his elder brother,
who was a remarkably steady young
man. I will not mention their
names, as both are living; but for
convenience will call the elder Fritz
and the younger Carl.</p>

<p>“Carl was given to be quarrelsome
in his cups, and on this occasion
was more so than usual, and
began to struggle with his brother,
who wanted to get him on board,
as the boat was in the act of starting;
in doing so, however, he lost
his balance, and they fell into the
water together.</p>

<p>“Carl, with the luck which is
proverbially attributed to drunkards,
was almost immediately pulled
out by those who had seen the accident.
Fritz, however, appeared
to have been carried away by the
current, all search proving in vain.</p>

<p>“Carl, now completely sobered,
was terribly afflicted, as he was
deeply attached to his brother, and
remembering the traditional sanctity
of the Altar of Succor, he
started off and walked all night,
and, wet as he was, threw himself
at the foot of the altar. There he
remained for some hours; whilst
prostrate there, another man came
in and knelt beside him.</p>

<p>“It is always rather dark at that
side altar, which, being situated in
the north aisle, was darker still at
that hour of the morning.</p>

<p>“I had observed the prostrate
man soon after the church had
been opened in the morning. When
next I passed I saw him prostrate
still, with another kneeling beside
him.</p>

<p>“Thinking there might be something
wrong, I went up, and stooping,
laid my hand upon his shoulder;
he was wet, and a shiver ran
through him at my touch. To my
surprise I saw that there was a pool
of water round the kneeling man.</p>

<p>“At my touch the man raised
himself, exclaiming, as he did so,
‘Yes, I did it; but I did not mean
it! Take me if you will!’</p>

<p>“Before I could explain, the other
rose to his feet, exclaiming, in
a voice of great emotion, ‘Carl!’
In an instant the brothers were in
each other’s arms, and explanations
were made. It appears that Fritz
went down at once, and, being unable
to swim, was borne down for
some distance under water. On
coming to the surface his head
came in contact with some substance
which he instinctively grasped;
it was wood, and was large
enough to enable him to keep his
head above water. He drifted down
the current till, almost dead with
cold, he found himself cast ashore
at a bend of the river.</p>

<p>“He was glad to find a cottage
door open, where he was welcomed
to warm himself and to share the
peasants’ humble meal. There also
he learned that he was not far from
A&mdash;&mdash;k and the wonderful Altar of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
Succor, and at once resolved to
come here, moved by gratitude for
his escape, and anxiety for his brother,
of whose fate he was of course
ignorant.</p>

<p>“A year passed, and one morning
Carl called upon me, and I then
fully learned the particulars I have
just related.</p>

<p>“At his request I attached the
small bottle to the other tokens, in
gratitude, as he said, for the victory
there granted to him over the evil
habit which must, otherwise, have
rendered his life a curse.</p>

<p>“He also left a sum of money
for the poor, and told me that his
brother and himself were both married,
and living as prosperous merchants
at a considerable town lower
down the Rhine.</p>

<p>“Go thou and do likewise!”
added the good priest, laughing as
we shook hands at parting.</p>

<h3>ON THE WAY TO LOURDES.</h3>

<p class="center">CONCLUDED.</p>

<p>Leaving Lectoure, the railway
keeps along the valley of the Gers,
a branch of the Garonne several
shades yellower than the Tiber.
The sides of the road are covered
with <i lang="fr">genêt</i>, or broom, loaded with
yellow blossoms&mdash;the emblem of
the Plantagenets, to whom this part
of France was once subject. It is
not long before we come to Mount
St. Cricq at the left, where, in the
IVth century, the glorious S. Oren,
the apostle of the country, demolished
a temple of Apollo-Belen,
and set up an altar to the only true
and uncreated Light under the invocation
of S. Quiricus (S. Cyr)
and S. Julitta. The church is now
gone. A windmill stands near its
site, the only prominent object on
the hill, which is as bald and parched
as if Apollo had claimed it for
his own again.</p>

<p>Auch now comes in sight, built
on a height, and crowned with the
towers of its noble cathedral. The
sides of the hill are covered with
houses, whose arched galleries are
open to the sun and pure mountain
air, and gay with vines and
flowers. The terraces before them
look like hanging gardens, which
give a charming freshness to the
picturesque old city. The Gers
flows along at the foot of the hill
as quietly as when Fortunatus sang
of its sluggishness centuries ago.
We cross it, and gain access to the
city by one of the long, narrow,
steep, sunless staircases of stone,
called <i lang="fr">pousterles</i>, which remind us
of Naples and Perugia. The place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
in fact, is quite Italian in its whole
aspect. As we ascend one of these
flights we see, away up at the top, a
large iron cross with all the emblems
of the Passion in the centre
of the landing-place, and we feel
as if we were ascending some <i lang="fr">Calvaire</i>.
There is a broad modern
staircase, much more grand and
elegant, but not so interesting, dignified
by the imposing term of <i lang="fr">escalier
monumental</i>, which takes one
up a more gradual and less weary
way of two hundred and thirty-two
steps&mdash;something rather formidable,
however, for the fat and scant
o’ breath!</p>

<p>These old cities, built on heights
for greater security, were powerful
holds in the Middle Ages, and all
have their history. Their towers
are all scarred over with fearful
tragedies, relieved here and there
by some flower of sweet romance
or saintly legend.</p>

<p>Auch was in ancient times called
Climberris, the stronghold of the
<em>Ausci</em>, who dwelt here before the
Roman conquest&mdash;descendants of
the Iberians from the Caucasian regions,
who left their country and
settled in Spain and this side of the
Pyrenees. The chief city of the
most civilized people of the country,
a Roman settlement under the
Cæsars, the most important place
in Novempopulania, the capital of
the Counts of Fezensac and Armagnac
in the Middle Ages, and a
wealthy influential see, whose archbishops
took part in all the great
movements of the day, Auch was
from early times a place of no small
importance, however insignificant
now.</p>

<p>When Cæsar’s lieutenant, Publius
Crassus, took possession of
the country, he established a Roman
colony on the banks of the
Algersius, and the Ausci, descending
from their heights, it became
so flourishing that it received the
imperial name of Augusta Auscorum,
and was one of the few cities
of the land to which the Roman
emperors accorded the Latin right&mdash;that
is, the power of governing
itself. In the year 211, Caracalla
allowed it the privilege of having
a forum, gymnasium, theatre, baths,
etc., and it became the seat of a
senate, the head of which was a
Roman officer called <i lang="la">comes</i>. Roman
domination was at first submitted
to reluctantly, but it proved an
advantage to the city. Literature
and the arts were cultivated with
success, the people enriched by
new sources of industry, sumptuous
villas were built in the environs,
and roads opened to Toulouse and
various parts of Novempopulania.
The pre-eminence of the schools
here is evident from the poet Ausonius,
tutor of the Emperor Gratian,
who spent part of his youth at
Auch, pursuing his studies under
Staphylius and Arborius, both of
whom he eulogizes for their learning.
Arborius, the brother of Ausonius’
mother, was the son of an
astrologer, from a distant part of
Gaul, who married a lady of rank
in this country and settled here.
He taught rhetoric, not only at
Auch, but at Toulouse, where he
became the confidential friend of
Constantine’s brothers, then in a
kind of exile. This led to his
fortune. The emperor afterward
called him to Constantinople, where
he was loaded with riches and
honors.</p>

<p>Ausonius’ friend, Eutropius, a
celebrated Latin author who held
offices under Julian the Apostate,
had a seat in the vicinity of Auch.</p>

<p>The women, too, of this country
were inspired with a taste for mental
cultivation, as is shown by Sylvia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
sister of the illustrious Rufinus
of Elusa, one of the best-versed
women of her day in Greek literature,
and who rivalled the noble
Roman matrons of the time of S.
Jerome in her knowledge of sacred
science. Sylvia died at Brescia,
where her name is still honored,
while her native land has nearly
forgotten her memory.</p>

<p>The prosperity of Auch was put
an end to in the Vth century by the
invasion of the Goths and Vandals,
and the city was only saved from
destruction by the mediation of S.
Oren, its bishop. In the VIIIth
century the country was overrun
by the Moors, who destroyed the
whole city, with the exception of a
faubourg still known, after more
than a thousand years, as the Place
de la Maure.</p>

<p>Two centuries after, the Counts
of Armagnac built a castle on the
summit of the hill where stood the
ancient Climberris, and gathered
their vassals around them. Here
they held a brilliant court which
attracted gallant knights and the
gayest troubadours of the south.
We read that one of the counts,
whose stout heart yielded for a time
to the softening influences of the
poetic muse, went to Toulouse to
breathe out his tender lays at the
feet of a certain fair lady, Lombarda,
but prudence getting the better
of his gallantry, he abruptly brought
them to an end, and hurried back
to the defence of his castle, suddenly
besieged by the enemy.</p>

<p>It was also in the Xth century
Auch became a metropolitan see,
which was so generously endowed
by the barons of the country that it
became one of the wealthiest and
most powerful in the kingdom. Its
archbishops were to the great lords
of the province what the popes
then were to the sovereigns of Europe.
They were the lords spiritual,
not only of Novempopulania,
but the two Navarres. Kings of
England wrote them to secure their
influence, which was so great that
there was a rivalry among the leading
families desirous of securing the
see for their children. When the
Counts of Armagnac transferred
their capital to Lectoure, the archbishops
became sole lords of the
city, and in them centred its history
from that time. They bore the
proudest names in the land, and
maintained all the state to which
their birth and the importance of
their office entitled them. We read
that when they came to take possession
of their see, the Baron de
Montaut, at the head of all the
neighboring gentry, met them at the
entrance to the city, and with bared
head and knee took the archbishop’s
mule by the bridle and led him
to the castle. This was in accordance
with the customs of feudal
times, when vassals offered homage
to their liege lords by bending the
bared knee to the ground, an <em>extension</em>,
we suppose, of the Oriental
practice of baring the feet. We
learn from Andres de Poça, in his
work, <cite>De la Antigua Lenga y Comarcas
de las Españas</cite>, that the lords
of Biscay took their oaths of fealty
in the sanctuary in this way&mdash;a
custom derived, perhaps, from the
ancient Cantabrians, who, as Strabo
tells us, went to battle with one
foot shod and the other bare, reminding
one of the touching nursery
rhyme of “My son John,” or
the French ditty which is more to
the point:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">“Un pied chaussé et l’autre nu,</div>
<div class="verse">Pauvre soldat, que feras-tu?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There were two other bishops in
the south of France who received a
similar mark of homage at taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
possession of their sees. At Lectoure,
it was the Seigneur de Castelnau,
and at Cahors the Baron de
Ceissac, whose duty it was to offer
it. At Auch, the Baron de Montaut
afterwards served the archbishop
at dinner and received the
silver plate on the table as his perquisite.
Dom Brugelles, in his
Chronicles of the diocese, gives a
ludicrous account of the disappointment
of a Baron of Montaut at the
arrival of a cardinal-archbishop of
simple habits, whose service was
of glass, though of fine workmanship,
which so disappointed the
baron that he forgot his loyalty and
smashed all the dishes, to the great
disgust of the cardinal, who left
the city and never returned.</p>

<p>One of the Archbishops of Auch,
Geraud de Labarthe, went with
Richard the Lion-Hearted to the
Holy Land, and had command of
an armament. He knew also, it
seems, how to wield his spiritual
weapons, for on the way he stopped
in Sicily for a theological encounter
with the celebrated abbot Joachim,
in which he proved himself
worthy of his descent from the
Lords of the Four Valleys. He
died in the Holy Land in 1191,
leaving a foundation for the repose
of his mother’s soul, a touching incident
in the life of this valorous
churchman.</p>

<p>Another archbishop established
the Truce of God in his province,
issued indulgences to encourage
his people to go to the aid of the
Spanish in their crusade against
the Moors, and finally placed himself
at the head of those who responded
to his appeal and went to
the assistance of Don Alfonso of
Aragon, where he distinguished
himself by his bravery and religious
zeal.</p>

<p>Other prelates have a simpler
record which it is pleasant to come
upon in such rude times. Of one
we read he granted an indulgence
of three days to all who should
bow the head at hearing the Holy
Name of Jesus. This was in 1383,
when S. Bernardin of Sienna, the
great propagator of this devotion,
was still a child.</p>

<p>In the XIVth century we find
Cardinal Philip d’Alençon, of the
blood royal of France, among the
archbishops of Auch. He died in
Rome in the odor of sanctity, and
was buried in the church of Santa
Maria in Trastevere, where his
beautiful Gothic tomb&mdash;a <i lang="fr">chef-d’œuvre</i>
of the XIVth century&mdash;may
be seen in the left transept.
In the arch is a fresco of the martyrdom
of his patron, S. Philip, who
was crucified with his head downward,
like S. Peter; and beneath
lies the cardinal on his tomb, sculptured
in marble, with hands folded
in eternal prayer. Above are his
cardinal’s hat and the <i lang="fr">fleurs-de-lis</i>
of France, and below is the epitaph:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">Ut sua supplicibus cumulentur marmora votis.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This prelate was the nephew and
godson of Philippe le Bel, the destroyer
of the Knights-Templars and
persecutor of Pope Boniface VIII.,
who merited the stigma Dante casts
on him in his <cite>Purgatorio</cite>:</p>

<div class="verse">The vinegar and gall once more applied,</div>
<div class="verse">And he ’twixt living robbers doomed to bleed.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“When, O Lord! shall I behold
that vengeance accomplished which,
being already determined in thy

justice even now contemplates
with delight?” continues the spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
met by the Divine Poet in the
place of expiation&mdash;words that
might be echoed in these days,

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We are here reminded it was at
Auch all the Knights-Templars of
Bigorre, with their commander,
Bernard de Montagu, were executed.
M. Martin, in his <cite>History of
France</cite>, observes that all the traditions
of this region are favorable to
the Templars. There is not one
that is not to their credit. The
old saying, “Drink like a Templar,”
has no echo in the mountains of
Bigorre. Many of their churches
are still standing, objects of interest
to the archæologist, and of devotion
to the pious. There are six or
seven skulls shown at Gavarnie,
said to be of the martyred Templars,
and every year, on the anniversary
of the destruction of the
Order, a knight armed from top to
toe, and wearing the great white
mantle of the Order, appears in the
churchyard and cries three times:
“Who will defend the Holy Temple?
Who will deliver the Sepulchre
of the Lord?” Then the
seven heads come to life and reply:
“No one! no one! The Temple is
destroyed!” How earnestly these
unfortunate knights begged to be
tried by the Inquisition is well
known. They felt there was some
chance for justice at a tribunal in
which there was a religious element.</p>

<p>A Cardinal d’Armagnac was
Archbishop of Auch when the tragedy
of Rodèle took place, which
rivals that of the Torre della Fame
at Pisa in horror. Geraud, brother
of Count Bernard VII. of Armagnac,
having married his son to
Margaret of Comminges, took up
arms against her for forsaking her
youthful husband and withdrawing
to the castle of Muret. Count Bernard
took advantage of this to
make war on Geraud for holding
the county of Pardiac, on which he
himself had claims, and pursued
his brother from one castle to another.
Finally taking him captive,
he carried him to the fortress of
Rodèle, and threw him into a deep
pit, where he died of hunger and
cold in four or five days.</p>

<p>Geraud’s two sons, John and
Guilhem, alarmed at his captivity,
but unaware of his fate, were induced
to come to Auch to implore the
clemency of their ferocious uncle,
and on Good Friday, 1403, the
Count de l’Isle Jourdain, kneeling
with the poor children at his
feet, besought him to pardon them,
in memory of the Divine Passion
that day celebrated; but neither
the day nor the helplessness of
the children, so touchingly alluded
to by their advocate, softened the
inflexible count. He had them imprisoned
in the castle of Lavardens,
and shortly after, Guilhem, a lad
of barely fifteen, was tied to a horse
and taken to the fortress of Rodèle.
There he was shown the horrible
pit into which his father had been
let down alive to incur so fearful a
death. The poor boy looked into
the fatal pit, fell senseless to the
ground, and was never restored to
life. His brother John, the unhappy
husband of the faithless
Margaret of Comminges, was carried
to the castle of Brugens, where
horrid tortures awaited him. He
had only escaped from the hatred
of his wife to fall into the hands of
Bonne de Berri, Count Bernard’s
wife, a woman of insatiable ambition
and relentless purpose. This
new Frédégonde put his eyes out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
by passing a red-hot brazier before
them, and then, remembering the
strength God gave the blind Samson
to take vengeance on his enemies,
she had him thrown into a deep
moat, where he died of hunger.</p>

<p>Never was there a family that
reflected more faithfully than the
Armagnacs all the vices and defects
as well as the virtues of the
Middle Ages. Its history contains
every element to fix the attention,
with its tragedies, its examples of
brutal power, its prodigies of valor
and heroism, its struggles in the
cause of liberty, and, finally, in its
marvels of faith. Religious influence
sooner or later asserted its
triumph in the heart. Many of the
counts laid aside their armor for
the cowl and scapular, and atoned
for their sins in the cloister. They
were benefactors to the Church,
they founded monasteries, they
fought in the holy wars. We find
them with Godfrey of Bouillon
under the walls of Jerusalem, and
fighting against the Moors with the
Kings of Castile and Aragon.
Among the most renowned members
of the race, we must not forget
Count John I., a native of Auch,
whose valor placed him on a level
with Du Guesclin, the greatest captain
of the age. For a time they
fought on the same side, but they
met as opponents on the plain of
Navarrete, where Count John fought
for Don Pedro and greatly contributed
to the victory. Du Guesclin
was taken prisoner. For more than
thirty years Count John was one
of the strongest supporters of the
King of France. After the battle
of Crécy, he stopped the tide of
English invasion, and when the
Black Prince was covering Aquitaine
with blood and ruins in 1355,
he alone ventured to resist him and
obstruct his victorious march.</p>

<p>After the defeat at Poitiers, he
veiled the humiliation of the king
with the splendor of his munificence.
He sent the king all kinds of provisions,
as well as silver utensils, for
his table. He convoked the Etats-Généraux
to organize forces to
avert calamities that threatened
the country. He fought beside the
Duke of Anjou and Du Guesclin
in the immortal campaigns of 1369
and 1370. This was the period in
which the grandeur of the house
of Armagnac culminated. John I.
married Reine de Got, niece of
Pope Clement V., whom Dante
thrusts lower than Simon Magus.
She was buried in the choir of the
Cordeliers at Auch, now, alas! a
granary. The count’s second wife
was Beatrice de Clermont, great-granddaughter
of S. Louis IX.,
king of France, and one of his
daughters married the brother of
Charles V., and the other the oldest
son of Don Pedro of Aragon.</p>

<p>Such were the royal pretensions
of this great house. Descended
from the Merovingian race of kings
through Sanche Mitarra, the terrible
scourge of the Moors, who lies
buried at S. Oren’s Priory, founded
by the first Count of Armagnac, on
the banks of the Gers, the Counts
of Auch, as they were sometimes
called, bore themselves right royally.
They acknowledged no suzerain.
They were the first to call
themselves counts <em>by the grace of
God</em>, a formula then used to express
the divine right, but in the sense
of S. Paul and of the Middle Ages,
which was simply acknowledging
that all power comes from God, and
that the right of exercising it has
for its true source not the force
of arms, but in God alone. We
must come down to the XVth century
to find the jealous susceptibility
that only interpreted, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
sense of absolute independence of
all human power, such expressions
as <i lang="la">Dei gratiâ</i>; <i lang="la">per Dei gratiam</i>;
<i lang="la">Dei dono</i>, etc., which had been used
with the sole intention of expressing
a truth of the Christian faith, a
profound sentiment of subordination
to divine authority. This intention
is nowhere so explicit as in
the legend on the ancient money of
Béarn, where its rulers used almost
the words of the apostle: <i lang="la">Gratia
autem Dei sumus id quod sumus</i>.</p>

<p>Charles VII. thought it worth
while to forbid John IV. of Armagnac,
in 1442, the use of such formulas.
Seven years after, he obliged
the Dukes of Burgundy to declare
they bore no prejudice to the crown
of France. Louis XI. vainly tried
to prevent the Duke of Brittany
from using them. Since that time
it has been claimed as the exclusive
right of sovereigns. Bishops,
however, retain the formula <i lang="la">Dei
gratia</i> in their public acts of diocesan
administration, with the addition:
<i lang="la">et apostolicæ sedis</i>, which dates
from the end of the XIIIth century
only.</p>

<p>It was the independence and
royal pretensions of such great vassals
that determined the kings of
France to destroy their power.
Under the sons of Philip le Bel began
the great struggle between the
crown and the feudal aristocracy.
In order to incorporate their provinces
with the royal domains, they
availed themselves of every pretext
to crush them, and such pretexts
were by no means wanting in the
case of the Armagnacs, where they
could claim the necessity of protecting
the eternal laws on which
are based all family and social
rights and the principles of true
religion. History is full of the
cruelty of the last counts, and forgets
all it could offer by way of
contrast. It forgets to speak of
Count John III., who put an end
to the brigandage of the great bands
in southern France, and went to
find a premature death under the
walls of Alessandria, in an expedition
too chivalrous not to be glorious.
It insists on the brutal ferocity and
excessive ambition of Bernard VII.,
the great constable, and passes over
all that could palliate his offences
in so rude an age&mdash;his fine qualities,
his zeal for the maintenance of
legitimate authority, and his interest
in the welfare of the Church. It
lays bare the criminal passion of
Count John V., and forgets his repentance
and reparation, as well
as the holy austerities of Isabella
in the obscure cell of a Spanish
monastery, where she effaced the
scandal she had given the world.</p>

<p>Count John was the last real
lord of Armagnac. He filled up
the cup of wrath, and his humiliations
and frightful death, the long,
unjust captivity of his brother
Charles, the scaffold on which perished
Jacques de Nemours, and
the abjection into which his children
were plunged, are fearful examples
of divine retribution.</p>

<p>The spoils of the counts of Armagnac
were given as a dowry to
Margaret of Valois when she married
Henry II. of Navarre, who, as
well as her first husband, the Duc
d’Alençon, descended from the
Armagnacs. Henry and Margaret
made their solemn entry into Auch
in 1527, and the latter, as Countess
of Armagnac, took her seat as honorary
canon in the cathedral. Her
arms are still over the first stall at
the left, beneath the lion rampant
of the Armagnacs&mdash;a stall assigned
those lords as lay canons, in the
time of Bernard III., who was the
first to pay homage to S. Mary of
Auch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret’s grandson, Henry IV.,
united the title of Armagnac to
the crown of France, and Louis
XIV., on his way from St. Jean-de-Luz,
where he was married to
Maria Theresa, the Infanta of Spain,
passed through Auch, and, attending
divine service in the cathedral,
took his seat in the choir as Count
of Armagnac.</p>

<p>Napoleon III. accepted the title
of honorary canon of this church.</p>

<p>The cathedral at Auch is remarkable
for the stained glass windows
of the time of the Renaissance,
which Catherine de Medicis wished
to carry off to Paris, and the one
hundred and thirteen stalls of the
choir, the wonderful carvings of
which rival those of Amiens. Napoleon
I., on his return from Spain,
admired and coveted these beautiful
stalls, and wished to remove the
old rood-loft which concealed them
from the public. He endowed the
church with an annual sum, and
expressed his regret so fair a <i lang="it">Sposa</i>
should be bereaved of its lord&mdash;the
hierarchy not being fully restored
in France at that time.</p>

<p>The canons of the cathedral were
formerly required to be <i lang="la">nobilis sanguine
vel litteris</i>&mdash;noble of birth or
distinguished in letters. That they
keep up to their standard in learning
seems evident from the reputation
of one of their number, the savant
Abbé Canéto, one of the most
distinguished archæologists of the
country, whose works are indispensable
to the visitor to Auch and the
surrounding places.</p>

<p>It is quite impressive to see these
venerable canons seated in their
carved stalls, worthy of princes,
singing the divine Office. Their
capes, we noticed, are trimmed with
ermine, probably a mark of their
dignity. To wear furs of any kind
was in the Middle Ages an indication
of rank, or, at least, wealth.
The English Parliament made a
statute in 1334 forbidding all persons
wearing furs that had not an
income of one hundred pounds a
year.</p>

<p>In this church is the altar of Notre
Dame d’Auch, the oldest shrine
of the Virgin in the province, first
set up at ancient Elusa by S. Saturninus,
the Apostle of Toulouse, and
brought here by S. Taurin in the
IVth century, when that place was
destroyed by the barbarians.</p>

<p>The similarity of S. Saturninus’
devotion to that of the present day is
remarkable&mdash;devotion to Mary and
the Chair of Peter. Everywhere he
erected churches in their honor, as
at Elusa, now the town of Eauze.
At Auch he dedicated a church to
the Prince of the Apostles, where
now stands the little church of S.
Pierre, on the other side of the
Gers, once burned down by the
Huguenots.</p>

<p>The paintings of the Stations of
the Cross in the cathedral were
given by a poor servant girl, whose
heart at the hour of death turned
towards the sanctuary where she
had so often experienced the benefit
of meditating on the Sacred Passion
that she was desirous of inciting
others to so salutary a devotion.</p>

<p>In one of the chapels is a monument
to the memory of M. d’Etigny,
whose statue is on the public promenade&mdash;the
last Intendant of the province,
who employed a part of his
immense fortune in building the fine
roads that lead to the watering-places
in the Pyrenees, which have added so
much to the prosperity of the country.
But he was one of those <i lang="la">cui
bono</i> men who always sacrifice the
picturesque and the interesting on
some plea of public utility. He
destroyed the mediæval character
of the city, with its narrow streets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
curious overhanging houses&mdash;of
which a few specimens are left&mdash;and
ancient walls with low arched gateways,
made when mules alone were
used for bringing in merchandise.
When any sacrifice is to be made,
why must it always fall on what appeals
to the eye and the imagination?
Why must some people insist
on effacing the venerable records
of past ages to make room for
their own utilitarian views? There
are too many of such palimpsests.
Is not the world large enough for
all human tastes to find room to express
themselves?</p>

<p>We had, however, no reason to
grumble at M. d’Etigny’s fine roads
among the mountains, which saved
us, in many instances, from being
transported like the ancient merchandise
of Auch, and we nearly forgot
his enormities when we found
ourselves at Bagnères-de-Luchon
under the shade of the fine trees he
planted in the Cours d’Etigny,
where tourists and invalids love to
gather in the evening.</p>

<p>M. d’Etigny also took an interest
in the religious prosperity of
the country. On the corner-stone
of a church at Vic Fezensac is the
inscription: <i lang="la">Dominus d’Etigny me
posuit</i>, 1760. This church was built
by Père Pascal, a Franciscan, out
of the ruins of the old castle of
the Counts of Fezensac, which he
obtained permission to use in spite
of the town authorities, by applying
to Mme. de Pompadour, then
all-powerful at court. Do not suppose
the good friar paid the least
homage to wickedness in high
places by so doing. On the contrary,
he boldly began his petition:
“Madame, redeem your sins by
your alms.” Instead of taking offence,
the duchess profited by the
counsel. The <i lang="fr">père</i>, returning from
Auch with the royal permission,
met some of his opponents, wholly
unsuspicious of the truth, to whose
pleasantries he replied: “Let me
pass. I am exhausted, for I carry
in my cowl the ruins of the castle
of Vic.”</p>

<p>Auch in those days was only
lighted by the lamps that hung before
the niches of the Virgin, and
the only night-watchman up to the
last century was the crier, who went
about the streets at midnight calling
aloud on the people to be mindful
of their soul’s salvation and
pray for the dead. This practice
was called the <i lang="la">miseremini</i>, because
the crier sometimes made use of the
words of Job sung in the Mass for
the Dead: <i lang="la">Miseremini, miseremini
mei, vos saltem amici mei, quia manus
Domini tetigit me</i>&mdash;“Have pity
on me, have pity on me, O ye my
friends! for the hand of the Lord
hath touched me.” It was also called
the Reveillé, from the beginning
of the verses he sometimes chanted:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Réveille-toi, peuple Chrétien,</div>
<div class="verse">Réveille-toi, c’est pour ton bien.</div>
<div class="verse">Quitte ton lit, prend tes habits,</div>
<div class="verse">Pense à la mort de Jésus Christ.</div>
<div class="verse">A la mort, à la mort, il faut tous venir,</div>
<div class="verse">Tout doit enfin finir.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Quand de ce monde tu partiras,</div>
<div class="verse">Rien qu’un linceul n’emporteras</div>
<div class="verse">Ton corps sera mangé des vers</div>
<div class="verse">Et peut-être ton âme aux enfers.</div>
<div class="verse">A la mort, à la mort, etc.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Tu passeras le long d’un bois,</div>
<div class="verse">Là tu trouveras une croix,</div>
<div class="verse">Sur cette croix il y a un écrit</div>
<div class="verse">C’est le doux nom de Jésus Christ,</div>
<div class="verse">A la mort, à la mort, etc.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This crier acted the part of a
policeman, keeping an eye on the
evil-doer, and watching over the
safety of the town. If he discovered
a door ajar, he entered and
aroused the inmates. A startling
apparition he must have been to
the offenders of the law. He wore
a death’s head and cross-bones embroidered
before and behind, and
carried a small bell in his hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
which he rang from time to time
as he passed through the narrow
streets with his lugubrious cry. Of
course he was a public functionary
of importance. He figured in full
costume in the great religious processions
and took a part in all the
public festivities.</p>

<p>On the sunny terraces of Auch
grow the seedless pears which have
been so renowned from time immemorial
that they have their place
in the annals of the city. We have
fully tested the qualities of these
unrivalled pears, and can sincerely
echo all that has been said in their
praise. Duchesne, the physician
of Henry IV., an empiric of the
school of Paracelsus, and a famous
person in his day, does not forget
in his <cite>Diæteticon</cite> to mention them
among the most famous productions
of his country. He places
them in the first rank, and those of
Tours in the second. According
to him, they originated in the town
of Crustumerium in Italy, and
their name, derived therefrom, was
softened by the Italians into Cristiano,
whence that of Bon Chrétien,
as they are sometimes called,
though not their right name. Others
call them Pompéienne, because,
as they say, introduced by Pompidian,
an ancient bishop of Eauze.
But everybody with a proper sense
of the case will stoutly attribute
them, in accordance with the popular
tradition, to the great S. Oren,
whose blessing gave them their
rare qualities, especially the peculiarity
of being seedless when
the trees grow within the limit of
the city, though this is by no
means the case with those that
grow in the environs.</p>

<p>Dom Brugelles, a Benedictine
of last century, mentions this peculiarity
in his Chronicles of the
diocese, and says they were in
such demand in his time as to be
worth sometimes thirty-six francs a
dozen.</p>

<p>Père Aubéry, in his Latin poem
of <cite>Augusta Auscorum</cite>, is enthusiastic
in their praise: “How I love
the aspect of these fair gardens enclosed
among sumptuous dwellings!
What a wealth of flowers!
And the trees bear a fruit still
more worthy of your admiration.
The Pompéienne pear, delicious
as the ambrosia of the gods, was
reserved for the soil of this city
alone. The trees without its walls,
even those that grow close to its
trenches, do not produce the like.
This most glorious of fruit is an
inappreciable gift of heaven and
earth, which is praised throughout
the kingdom and sold at a great
price in distant lands.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>“The pears of the fertile gardens
of Touraine cannot be compared
to those whose old name of Pompéienne
is now lost in that of Bon
Chrétien. The pears at Tours are
as inferior to those of Auch as
other honey in sweetness to that
of Hybla. Nay, should the gods
themselves by chance know of
these trees, should they taste of
these Auscitain pears so delicious
to the palate, they would despise
the dishes served at their celestial
banquets&mdash;yes, scorn the flowing
nectar and sweet ambrosia that
feed their immortality.</p>

<p>“And as the admirable name of
Bon Chrétien is only given the
pears that grow in the gardens of
the city, and belongs not to those
produced elsewhere; as it is only
within these walls they acquire so
agreeable and appetizing a flavor,
their name is a presage that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
inhabitants shall never be infected
by the contagion and venom of
heresy&mdash;a scourge that has attacked
almost all the towns of Armagnac&mdash;and
that the Mother of
Christ, patroness of Auch, by averting
this poison, shall keep them
faithful to the rites of their ancestors,
and fill them with eternal
love for the ancient religion.”</p>

<p>M. Lafforgue, in his <cite>History of
Auch</cite>, says these pears are so
prized that they are often presented
to princes, governors, and
other distinguished characters.
When Elizabeth Farnese, Queen
of Spain, passed through Auch
on her way to join her husband
Philip V., in Nov., 1714, the city
consuls offered her, as they had
done the Dukes of Berry and
Burgundy in 1701, some of the
<i lang="fr">poires d’Auch</i>. Twenty dozen,
which cost one hundred and forty-three
livres, were presented her
in straw boxes made by the Ursuline
nuns.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>When Mr. Laplagne, a native of
this part of the country, and Minister
of Finance under Louis Philippe,
boasted in M. Guizot’s presence,
with true Gascon expansiveness, of
the seedless pears that grow on the
terraces of Auch, the latter, with the
distrust of certain great minds, expressed
some incredulity. M. Laplagne
resolved to convince the
President of the Council publicly,
and procured at some expense an
enormous pear, ripened on the very
terrace which a century before had
produced the fruit so vaunted by
Dom Brugelles. Fifty guests were
invited to witness the result. They
assembled around the table, in the
centre of which was displayed the
wonderful pear from Auch. M.
Guizot could hardly believe his
eyes at such a prodigy, and declared
himself convinced. The dessert
was impatiently awaited. The
Minister of Finance, certain of victory,
insisted on M. Guizot’s opening
the pear. It was set before him.
He cut it in two with some difficulty&mdash;it
contained four large seeds!</p>

<p>In spite of this exceptional case,
the <i lang="fr">poires d’Auch</i> (their right name,
by the way) that grow within
the limits of the city are generally
without seeds. The superabundant
pulp seems to stifle them.
They are still the pride of the place,
and it was only a year or two ago a
number were sent to his Holiness
Pius IX.</p>

<p>Père Aubéry, whom I have quoted,
was connected with the college
at Auch, formerly under the direction
of the Jesuits. S. Francis Regis
was also for some time one of
its professors. Among the eminent
men educated here may be mentioned
Cardinal d’Ossat, who, when
<i lang="fr">chargé d’affaires</i> at Rome, succeeded
in obtaining the absolution of
Henry IV. from the Holy See. He
was a poor country lad, whose condition,
exciting the pity of the canons
of Trie, they made him a choirboy,
and sent him to school. He
became successively a charity scholar
of the Jesuits at Auch, the <i lang="fr">protégé</i>
of Cardinal de Foix and his
secretary of embassy at Rome, and,
finally, <i lang="fr">chargé d’affaires</i> at the Papal
court and Cardinal-bishop of
Bayeux. He died at Rome in 1604,
bequeathing the little he possessed
to the poor and his two secretaries.
This celebrated diplomatist was an
honor to his country and the church
that developed his talents.</p>

<p>The famous Nostradamus was
another pupil of this college.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span></p>

<p>Bernard du Poey, a disciple of
Buchanan, and a poet of some note,
was professor here when the college
was under the direction of laymen.
We give one of his epigrams, written
while connected with this institution:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Lucis amore simul fœdam protrudimus omnem</div>
<div class="verse">Barbariem: tenebris nec patet ista domus.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“The love of light makes us cast
away every vestige of barbarism:
this house opens not to darkness.”</p>

<p>“Barbarism”&mdash;“light”&mdash;“darkness”&mdash;a
jargon often heard in our
day also, and it still finds its dupes.
The would-be metaphysicians and
theologians who use it should
meditate on this sentence of Berkeley’s:
“We first raise a dust, and
then complain we cannot see!”</p>

<p>Once more on the way. It is
not till we approach Rabastens we
see an opening in the outer range
of the Pyrenees, and behold Mt.
Maladetta raising heavenward its
glittering diadem of glaciers. Behind
is Spain, religious Spain,
“land of an eternal crusade” and
wondrous saints. Rabastens is one
of the most ancient towns in Bigorre,
and celebrated in the religious
wars: It was here Blaise
de Monluc received the frightful
wound in his face which obliged
him to wear a mask the rest of
his life, and gave him the leisure
to write his Commentaries, which
Henry IV. called the Soldier’s Bible.
This old warrior, deprived
of nearly all his limbs, coolly relates
a thousand incidents of incredible
bravery in the boasting
manner of a true Gascon, that does
not ill become a book written for
the defenders of Gascony.</p>

<p>Twelve miles or so further on is
Tarbes, the <i lang="fr">chef-lieu</i> of the Hautes
Pyrénées&mdash;“gentille Reine.”</p>

<p>“Bigourdaine,” as Jasmin says,
“splendidement assise au milieu
de la plaine la plus fraiche, la plus
fertile et la plus variée.” The
water from the Adour, first brought
here to fill the moat that surrounded
the city, is now used to turn
mills and fertilize the meadows,
which are wonderfully fresh, affording
a charming contrast to
the mountains in the background.</p>

<p>The foundation of Tarbes is lost
in the remoteness of time. Its occupation
by the Romans is evident
from the camp still pointed out in
the vicinity. Bigorre, of which it
was the principal city, was made a
<i lang="fr">comté</i> in the VIIIth century, and
its succession of counts was uninterrupted
till Henry IV. ascended
the throne of France. Its first
count was Enéco (or Inigo) Arista,
or The Bold, who became King of
Navarre, and rivalled the Cid in
prowess.</p>

<p>Bigorre was ceded to the English
by the treaty of Brittany, but when
war again broke out between England
and France two great barons
of the province, Menaud de Barbazan
and the Sire d’Anchin, as
Froissart relates, seized the city
and castle of Tarbes, and all Bigorre
rose to expel the English,
who only continued to hold for a
time the impregnable fortresses of
Lourdes and Mauvezin. This Lord
of Barbazan was a companion in
arms of Du Guesclin and took
sides with the Armagnacs, his
kinsmen, in their famous contest
with the house of Foix. His son,
Arnauld Guilhem de Barbazan,
was the valiant knight who wore
so worthily the fair flower of a
blameless life that he received the
title, which he was the first to bear,
of the <i lang="fr">chevalier sans peur et sans
reproche</i>, conferred on him by his
contemporaries. Monstrelet says
he was a noble knight, prompt in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
action, fertile in expedients, and
renowned in arms. He was the
leader in the famous encounter between
seven French and seven
English knights at Saintonge in
1402, when the latter challenged
the French to a trial of arms out
of love for <i lang="fr">les dames de leurs pensées</i>.
The French knights began
the day by devoutly hearing Mass
and receiving the Holy Body of
the Lord. Jouvenel des Ursins depicts
the fearful encounter, which
took place in presence of a
vast number of spectators, among
whom was the Count of Armagnac.
Lances were shivered and
terrible blows given with sword
and battle-axe, but it was Barbazan
who decided the day, and the
English were forced to acknowledge
themselves defeated. The
conquerors, clothed in white, were
led in triumph to the King, who
loaded them with presents. To
the Chevalier de Barbazan he
gave a purse of gold and a sword
on one side of which was graven,
<i lang="fr">Barbazan sans reproche</i>, in letters
of gold; and on the other, <i lang="la">Ut
lapsu graviore ruant</i>. This sword
is still preserved in the Château
de Faudoas by the descendants
of Barbazan’s sister. The chivalric
deeds that won it were commemorated
not only in the chronicles
of the time, but in three ballads
of Christine de Pisan.</p>

<p>Barbazan was as noble in heart
as heroic in action. He took sides
with Count Bernard VII. of Armagnac
against the Duke of Burgundy,
but, when the latter fell a
victim to treachery, he indignantly
condemned the crime, and said he
would rather have died than had a
hand in it. He fought side by side
with Dunois, Lahire, and La Trémouille,
at Orleans, Auxerre, and
many another battle-field. His
last exploit was to rout eight thousand
English and Burgundian troops
near Chalons, with only three
thousand, a few months after the
atrocious murder of Joan of Arc,
under whose white banner he had
fought.</p>

<p>So valuable were his services
that the king conferred on him the
magnificent title of “Restaurateur
du royaume et de la couronne de
France,” and added the <i lang="fr">fleurs-de-lis</i>
to his arms. Soldiers received
knighthood from his hands as if he
were a king. When he died, he
was buried at St. Denis among the
kings of France with all the honors
of royalty&mdash;a supreme honor, of
which there are only two other instances
in French history&mdash;Du
Guesclin and Turenne.</p>

<p>The feudal castle of Barbazan is
on a steep hill a few miles southeast
of Tarbes. The Roman inscriptions
found there show it to be of
extreme antiquity. On the summit
of the hill is the chapel of Notre
Dame de Piétat, built by Anne de
Bourbon, Lord of Barbazan, to receive
a miraculous Madonna that
had long been an object of veneration
to the people around. He
founded two weekly Masses here,
one in honor of the holy name of
God, and the other of the Virgin,
and he bequeathed lands for the
support of the chapel, which is still
a pious resort for pilgrims.</p>

<p>The Cathedral of Tarbes is built
on the ruins of the ancient fortress
of Bigorre, which gave its name to
the surrounding province. The
bishops have an important place in
the annals of the country. Under
the Merovingian race of kings they
held the rank of princes, and were
the peers of the proudest barons in
the land. We find several saints
in the list&mdash;S. Justin, S. Faustus,
and S. Landeol, whose venerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
forms look down from the windows
of the chancel in the cathedral.
Gregory of Tours mentions S. Justin,
and speaks of a lily on his
tomb that bloomed every year on
the day of his martyrdom.</p>

<p>Bernard II., a bishop of Tarbes
in the year 1009, merits the admiration
of posterity for his efforts to
relieve his flock during a terrible
famine of three years, in which people
devoured one another to such
an extent that a law was made condemning
those who ate human
flesh to be burned alive. The
holy bishop, like S. Exuperius of
Toulouse, sold all the vessels and
ornaments of the church, and gave
all he possessed, to alleviate the
wants of his people.</p>

<p>His successor stayed a civil war
that broke out, to add to the distress
of the country, by assembling
the chief lords of the land and conjuring
them not to add fire and
pillage to the horrors of famine,
but rather seek to disarm the vengeance
of heaven by their prayers.
He established the Truce of God
in his diocese, and had the happiness
of seeing peace and abundance
restored to the land. These old
bishops seemed to have some correct
notions of their obligations,
though they did live in the darkest
of the Middle Ages!</p>

<p>In the time of a bishop who belonged
to the house of Foix appeared
a comet which alarmed all
Europe. The Pope profited by the
universal terror to recommend a
stricter practice of the Christian
virtues, in order, as he said, if any
danger were at hand, that the faithful
might be saved. The Bishop of
Tarbes instituted public processions
on the occasion.</p>

<p>It was a Bishop of Tarbes, the
Cardinal Gabriel de Gramont, who
in the XVIth century played so
important a part in the negotiations
between Henry VIII. of England
and the Pope to dissolve the marriage
of the former with Catherine
of Aragon. The king pretended to
act from conscientious motives, and
said the Bishop of Tarbes confirmed
his scruples. We need something
more than the mere word of
a monarch who violated the most
solemn promises and obligations
to induce us to believe in the complicity
of the bishop, though, deceived
by the representations of
the king, and alarmed at the consequences
of a rupture with the Holy
See, he may have endeavored to
temporize, that the crisis might be
delayed.</p>

<p>Tarbes was taken by the Huguenots
under the ferocious Count de
Montgomery in the XVIth century.
He devastated the cathedral, and
burned its fine organ, its altars,
vestments, choral books, library,
and chapter-house. The bells were
melted down, the bishop’s house
pillaged and burned, as well as the
residences of the canons, the convents
of the Cordeliers, Carmelites,
etc. The bishop was forced to
retreat to the mountains, where,
charmed by the picturesque heights
above the valley of Luz, he re-established
the springs of S. Sauveur,
and built a little chapel with the
inscription: <i lang="la">Vos haurietis aquas
de fontibus Salvatoris</i>; whence the
name since given this watering-place
was derived.</p>

<p>It is recorded of a bishop in the
XVIIth century, as something extraordinary,
that, contrary to custom,
he allowed his flock, in a time
of famine, to eat meat during Lent
on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.
He probably had the liberal
proclivities of Bishop Hébert of
Agen, already mentioned!</p>

<p>Finally, it was a Bishop of Tarbes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
who, in these days, restored four
devout chapels of the Virgin, of
ancient renown in the country, but
profaned at the Revolution and left
desolate, and gave them back to
Mary with priests to minister at
their altars: Notre Dame de Garaison,
in a valley of the Hautes
Pyrénées; Notre Dame de Piétat,
overlooking the plain of Tarbes;
Notre Dame de Poueylahun, on a
picturesque peak that rises from the
valley of Azun; and Notre Dame
de Héas, the Madonna of shepherds,
in a hollow of the wild mountains
near the Spanish frontier&mdash;a powerful
quadrilateral for the defence of
this diocese of Mary. The memory
of Bishop Lawrence will likewise
be for ever associated with the
church of Notre Dame de Lourdes,
for it was he who, by his zeal, prudence,
and spiritual insight contributed
so greatly to its foundation.
It became the cherished object
of interest in his old age. He begged
for it, labored for it, and watched
over the progress of the work.
His last act before attending the
Council of the Vatican was a pilgrimage
to the sacred Grotto, and
while at Rome his heart was constantly
turning to this new altar in
Mary’s honor, and testifying great
joy at the splendor of the solemnities.
He died at Rome in January,
1870, and his remains were brought
back to Tarbes for burial.</p>

<p>At Tarbes we changed cars for
Lourdes. Here we received our
first impressions of the great religious
movement in the country, manifested
by the immense pilgrimages,
which rival those of the Middle
Ages. We encountered a train of
pilgrims with red crosses on their
breasts and huge rosaries around
their necks. There were gentlemen
and ladies, and priests and
sisters of different religious orders.
Among them was a cardinal, whose
hand people knelt to kiss as he issued
from the cars. They all had
radiant faces, as if they had been
on some joyful mission instead of
a penitential pilgrimage. But one
of the fruits of penitence and faith
is joy in the highest sense of the
word. Spenser wisely makes the
proud Sansfoy the father of Sansjoy.</p>

<p>Leaving them behind, we kept on
in full view of the mountains along
a fine plateau called Lanne Maurine,
or the Land of the Moors.
The Moorish invasion, though more
than a thousand years ago, has left
ineffaceable traces all through this
country. The traveller is always
coming across them. In one place
is the Fountain of the Moors; in
another the Castle of the Moors;
and there are many families who
still bear the names of Maure and
Mouret. The Lanne Maurine is so
called from a bloody combat which
took place here to dispute the possession
of the plain. It was a priest
who roused the people to arms and
led them against the infidel, whom
they smote hip and thigh. A grateful
people have erected an equestrian
statue to his memory at the
entrance of his village church.</p>

<p>We were now rapidly approaching
Lourdes. Already the Pic du
Gers rose out of the valley sacred
to Mary, and the heart instinctively
turns from everything else to hail
the new star that has risen in these
favored heavens to diffuse the pure
radiance of the Immaculate Conception!</p>

<h3>EARLY ANNALS OF CATHOLICITY IN NEW JERSEY.</h3>

<p>The first navigators who are
known to have sailed along the
seaboard, and perhaps to have
landed on the soil of that part of
America now called New Jersey,
were Catholics, and in fact made
their voyages before Protestantism
was heard of. These hardy men
were Sebastian Cabot, a Venetian
in the service of King Henry VII.
of England, who sailed from Bristol
in the month of May, 1498, and,
proceeding considerably to the
north, afterwards turned south and
followed the coast-line as far as
the Chesapeake; and John Verazzano,
a Florentine in the pay of the
King of France, who, taking a
southerly course to America in
1524, proceeded along the coast
from Florida to the fiftieth degree
of north latitude, and is supposed
to have entered the harbor of New
York. The earliest colony established
here was about 1620, when
Dutch Calvinists (emigrants from
Holland) settled the town of Bergen;
and in 1638, a party of Swedes,
who were Lutherans, made several
settlements on the shore of the
Delaware. They were under the
patronage of their celebrated Queen
Christina, who later became a Catholic.
In 1664, a grant of the country
between the Connecticut and
the Delaware rivers was made by
King Charles II. of England&mdash;the
Swedes having been subjugated by
the Hollanders, and these in their
turn by the English&mdash;to his brother
the Duke of York, who afterwards
was a sincere convert to the Catholic
faith, and reigned as James II.
That portion of this territory which
is now New Jersey was sold by the
royal patron to two proprietors, one
of whom was Sir George Carteret;
and it was in his honor that it received
its present name, for his
having defended during the Parliamentary
war against the Revolutionists
the island of <em>Jersey</em>,
which is one of the so-called
Channel Isles on the coast of
France, and is full of ancient
churches and other memorials of
the Catholic faith, introduced there
by S. Helier in the VIth century.</p>

<p>But apart from the name there
was nothing that recalled the Catholic
religion in New Jersey. The
most intense anti-Catholic sentiment
was prevalent, and the bitter
fanaticism of the mother country
was extended even to these parts
with perhaps increased virulence.
Thus, in 1679, the 26th of November
was appointed a day of thanksgiving
in the colony for deliverance
from what was called “that horrid
plot of the Papists to murder the
King (Charles II.) and destroy all
the Protestants!”&mdash;which was the
infamous affair of Titus Oates, gotten
up maliciously against the
Catholics to have still another pretext
for persecuting them. The
whole province having been divided
into two parts, called respectively
East and West New Jersey,
the latter was settled, to mention
only the English-speaking population,
mostly by members of the
Society of Friends, commonly called
Quakers, from England, but the
former by Scotch Presbyterians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
and Congregationalists from New
England; and of this part Robert
Barclay was appointed first governor
for life, but, having power to
name a deputy, he remained in
Scotland. This miserable man, after
having become a Catholic in
France, where he had an uncle a
priest, who was at the expense of
educating him, relapsed into heresy
shortly after returning to his native
country, where his religion was proscribed,
and finally joined the Quakers,
for whom he wrote the famous
<cite>Apology</cite>. A circumstance in the
life of this apostate shows well the
constancy of the royal convert who
lost three kingdoms for his faith,
and must have reminded him of
his own instability upon the same
matter. Barclay was in London in
1688, probably on business connected
with his government of East
New Jersey, and solicited an interview
with King James. The
revolution was already breaking,
and his treacherous son-in-law,
afterwards William III., was on his
way to dethrone him; when, standing
by an open window of the
palace, his Majesty observed to the
governor that the wind was fair for
the Prince of Orange to come over:
whereupon Barclay replied that it
was hard no expedient could be
found to satisfy the people. The
king declared he would do anything
becoming a gentleman except
“<em>parting with liberty of conscience</em>,
which he never would while
he lived.” The king was indeed a
martyr to this principle, and how
much it was despised by his Protestant
betrayers may be seen, to
give an example out of these parts,
from the instruction given in 1703
to Lord Cornbury, governor of the
Jerseys (as well as of New York),
“to permit liberty of conscience
to all persons <em>except Papists</em>”; and
this barbarous intolerance continued
as long as the colonies remained
united to England. Every now
and then glaring cases of anti-Catholic
bigotry, calculated only to
perpetuate civil dissensions sprung
from religious differences, were
found in the history of the colony;
as, for instance, in 1757, when the
principal edifice of the College of
New Jersey at Princeton was
named by Governor Belcher <em>Nassau
Hall</em>&mdash;“to express,” he said,
“the honor we retain in this remote
part of the globe to the immortal
memory of the glorious
King William III., who was a
branch of the illustrious house of
Nassau, and who, under God, was
the great deliverer of the British
nation from those two <em>monstrous
furies</em>, <em>Popery</em> and slavery.” About
this period there were a few Jesuit
priests in Maryland and Pennsylvania;
and the earliest account that we
have of Catholics in New Jersey is
in 1744, when we read that Father
Theodore Schneider, a distinguished
German Jesuit who had professed
philosophy and theology in
Europe, and been rector of a university,
coming to the American
Provinces, “visited New Jersey
and held church at Iron Furnaces
there.” This good missionary was
a native of Bavaria. He founded
the mission at Goshenhoppen, now
in Berks county, Pennsylvania,
about forty-five miles from Philadelphia,
and ministered to German
Catholics, their descendants, and
others. Having some skill in medicine,
he used to cure the body as
well as the soul; and, travelling
about on foot or on horseback under
the name of Doctor Schneider
(leaving to the <em>Smelfunguses</em> to discover
whether he were of medicine
or divinity), he had access to places
where he could not otherwise have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
gone without personal danger; but
sometimes his real character was
found out, and he was several times
raced and shot at in New Jersey.
He used to carry about with him
on his missionary excursions into
this province a manuscript copy of
the <cite>Roman Missal</cite>, carefully written
out in his own handwriting and
bound by himself. His poverty or
the difficulty of procuring printed
Catholic liturgical books from Europe,
or, we are inclined to think,
the danger of discovery should
such an one with its unmistakable
marks of “Popery” about it (which
he probably dispensed with in his
manuscript), fall into the hands of
heretics, must have led him to this
labor of patience and zeal. Father
Schneider, who may be reckoned
the first missionary of New Jersey,
died on the 11th of July, 1764.
Another Jesuit used to visit the
province occasionally after 1762,
owing to the growing infirmities of
Father Schneider, and there still exist
records of baptisms performed by
him here. This was the Rev. Robert
Harding, a native of England, who
arrived in America in 1732. He
died at Philadelphia on the 1st of
September, 1772. But the priest
principally connected with the early
missions in New Jersey is the
Rev. Ferdinand Farmer. He was
born in South Germany in 1720,
and, having entered the Society of
Jesus, was sent to Maryland in
1752. His real name was Steenmeyer,
but on coming to this
country he changed it into one
more easily pronounced by English-speaking
people. He was
learned and zealous, and for
many years performed priestly duties
in New Jersey at several places
in the northern part, and seems to
have been the first to visit this colony
regularly. In his baptismal
register the following among other
places are named, together with the
dates of his ministrations: a station
called Geiger’s, in 1759; Charlottenburg,
in 1769; Morris County, Long
Pond, and Mount Hope, in 1776;
Sussex County, Ringwood, and
Hunterdon County, in 1785. The
chief congregation at this period
was at a place called Macoupin
(now in Passaic County), about fifteen
miles from the present city of
Paterson. It was settled in the
middle of the last century by Germans,
who were brought over to
labor in the iron mines and works
in this part of the province. Two
families from Baden among the
colonists were Catholics; and the
first priest who visited them is said
to have been a Mr. Langrey from
Ireland. Mount Hope, not far
from Macoupin, used to be visited
by Father Farmer twice a year, and
by other priests, as occasion might
require, from Philadelphia. Except
the Catholics in the northern
parts, there were very few scattered
about New Jersey before the American
Revolution. The schoolmaster
at Mount Holly in 1762 was an
Irish Catholic named Thomas
McCurtain, and one of his descendants
is the distinguished scholar
and antiquarian, John G. Shea.
The Catholics in these colonies before
American Independence were
subject in spiritual matters to the
Bishop (vicar-apostolic) of London,
who used to appoint a vicar-general
(the superior of the Jesuits in
Maryland) to supply his place.
After the suppression of the Society
of Jesus in 1773, the vicar-general.
Father John Lewis, was the late
superior of the order in this country.
The visits of the missionaries
to New Jersey seem to have been
interrupted during the Revolutionary
War; but a number of very distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
foreign Catholics serving
in our army honored the land
by their presence in such a cause.
Among them we find Lafayette,
Chevalier Massillon, De Kalb, Pulaski,
Kosciusko, and Mauduit du
Plessis, the engineer officer who fortified
Fort Mercer, at Red Bank on
the Delaware, with so much skill that
the attacking Hessians were thoroughly
repulsed. In the months of
August and September, 1781, the
French troops under De Rochambeau
marched diagonally across the
State from Sufferns (just over
line) in New York, by way of
Pompton, Whippany, Byram’s Tavern,
Somerville, Princeton, and
Trenton. An army chaplain, the
Abbé Robin, published a little book
in 1782, describing this French expedition
from New Port to York-town;
but, regrettably, he gives his
readers not a word about any Catholics
that he may have met or
heard of in New Jersey.</p>

<p>After the evacuation of New York
by the British in 1783, there was
a prospect of collecting the few
scattered Catholics on Manhattan
Island into a congregation, and the
venerable Father Farmer used to
go twice a year to visit the faithful
there, across the northern part of
this State, stopping on his way to
officiate at Macoupin. On the 22d
of September, 1785, the Rev. John
Carroll, who had been appointed by
the Pope superior of the church in
the United States and empowered
to give Confirmation, set out on a
tour to administer this sacrament
at Philadelphia, New York, and (as
he writes to a friend) “in the upper
counties of the Jerseys and Pennsylvania,
where our worthy German
brethren had formed congregations.”
In this year Rev. Mr. Carroll
computed the number of Catholics
under his charge at sixteen
thousand in Maryland, seven thousand
in Pennsylvania, and two
thousand scattered about the other
States. The number of priests was
nineteen in Maryland and five in
Pennsylvania. We learn how small
was the grain of mustard-seed of
the church in this part of the world
less than a hundred years ago, when
we see that there was no resident
priest at that time between Canada
and Pennsylvania; and it used to
be said contemptuously (so Watson
has it in his <cite>Annals</cite>): “John
Leary goes once a year to Philadelphia
to get absolution.” This worthy
man therefore, who was certainly
living in New York in 1774, had
to leave that city and cross the
whole of New Jersey before he could
perform his Easter duties. The
earlier editions of Catholic books
printed in the United States were
generally gotten up by subscription,
and a perusal of the lists of subscribers
is interesting, as giving some
idea of the number, zeal, and original
nationality (conjectured from
the form of patronymic) of the
Catholics at the time. Thus, to the
first Catholic Bible published in the
United States, at Philadelphia in
1790, only six out of the four hundred
and twenty-seven subscribers
were from New Jersey. These are
Joseph Bloomfield, Attorney-General
of the State; James Craft and
R. S. Jones, Burlington; John
Holmes, Cape May; Alexander
Kenney, near (New) Brunswick;
and Maurice Moynihan, Atsion;
but in considering this, the most interesting
to us of any lists of subscribers
to early Catholic books,
we must remember that the names
are not all of Catholics; and of
these six from New Jersey the
last three only are considered orthodox
by Archbishop Bayley in
his appendix to the <cite>History of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
the Catholic Church in New York</cite>
(2d ed.)</p>

<p>The massacre of 1793 in the Island
of Hayti drove a number of
French Catholics to the United
States, some of whom settled at
Mount Holly, Elizabethtown, and
other parts of the State, but we do
not know that they did anything
for the church. Catholic advance
was to come from quite another
immigration. In 1805, or earlier,
the Rev. John Tisserant, one of the
French clergy driven from home
by the Revolution, was living at
Elizabethtown. He was an excellent
man, and may be considered
the first resident priest in New
Jersey, although he cannot be said
to have been <em>stationed</em> here by authority.
He returned to Europe
in June, 1806. The minister of
the Presbyterian church at Whippany
(Morris County) from 1791 to
1795 was Calvin White. “His
ministry, though brief, was useful,”
says the historian. He afterwards
connected himself with the Episcopalians,
and finally became a Catholic.
A conversion of this kind
at that period was sufficiently remarkable,
we think, to be mentioned
in notes on the Catholic Church
in New Jersey.</p>

<p>In the year 1808, the dioceses of
New York and Philadelphia were
erected, with the northern part of
New Jersey within the former and
the southern within the latter diocese.
This arrangement continued
until 1853; and while it lasted religion
made some progress here,
but slowly. The Rev. Richard
Bulger, a native of Kilkenny, Ireland,
having come to the American
Mission, was ordained priest by
Bishop Connolly of New York, in
1820. He was assistant at the
cathedral in New York, and thence
regularly attended Paterson, where
he devoted himself to the Catholics
gathered in that manufacturing
town, and scattered about the upper
part of the State. The church
at Paterson is mentioned in the Almanac
of 1822; it being then the
only one in New Jersey. The pastor
was exposed to inconvenience,
insults, and hardship. One evening,
for instance, a bigoted ruffian threw
a large jagged stone into his lighted
room, the shutters or window-blinds
having been left unclosed, and he
had a narrow escape from a hole in
his head. On another occasion he
was rudely turned out on to the
muddy road with his Breviary and
bundle from a country cart, the
driver of which had given him a lift
until he discovered that he was a
priest. The account, however, says
that it was the farmer’s <em>wife</em> who
“declared that he should not remain
in the wagon”; and the man
afterwards applied to Father Bulger
for instruction, and was received
into the church, but we do not
hear of the conversion of the scold&mdash;perhaps
because (as an old poet
says)</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>About 1825, that part of New
Jersey under the jurisdiction of the
Bishop of Philadelphia used to be
visited occasionally by clergymen
from beyond the Delaware, and stations
were established at Pleasant
Mills and Trenton, which continued
to be served, but without resident
pastors (we believe), until the diocese
of Newark was erected. The
city of Newark had a pastor about
1830 in the person of Rev. Gregory
Pardow, who was in 1834 the only
priest actually residing in New
Jersey. After this period churches
were erected not only in the principal
city, Newark, but also in Jersey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
City, Perth Amboy, Belleville,
Madison, New Brunswick, Elizabethtown,
Macoupin, and other
centres of population. The church
at Macoupin was erected in 1841
by Father John Raffeiner, a native
of the Tyrol, who came to this
country in 1833, and used to visit
the Germans scattered through New
Jersey; and in 1842 a church in
Newark for the German Catholics
was erected by Father Balleis, a
Benedictine monk. On the 30th
of October, 1853, the Rt. Rev. J.
R. Bayley, at the time a priest in
New York, was consecrated first
bishop of Newark, the diocese being
coextensive with the State; and,
on his taking possession of his see,
found thirty-three churches and
thirty clergymen. Since then the
advance of the Catholic religion
here has been rapid; and when
Bishop Bayley was transferred to
Baltimore, he left to his successor
what is considered, we believe, one
of the completest dioceses in the
United States&mdash;a disciplined clergy,
religious orders of both sexes, diocesan
seminary, college for higher
education, academy for young
ladies, select and parochial schools,
orphan asylums, hospitals, cemeteries,
and other Christian institutions,
in a flourishing condition.
The progress of the church during
these latter years has been before
the eyes of all; and as we have intended
to limit ourselves to the
period anterior to the erection of
New Jersey into a diocese, in making
notes on Catholicity in the State,
we now end them, if even a little
abruptly.</p>

<h3>NEW PUBLICATIONS.</h3>

<div class="hanging">

<p><span class="smcap">Manual of the Blessed Sacrament</span>.
Translated from the French of Rev. T.
B. Boone, S.J., by Mrs. Annie Blount
Storrs. New York: The Catholic Publication
Society. 1875. 18mo, pp. 509.</p>

</div>

<p>The publication of this manual supplies
a real want which many devout
persons have felt, and which they will
now find fully satisfied. It is a companion
for the altar, a treasure of pious
reading, of meditation and prayers, for
Mass, Communion, Visits to the Blessed
Sacrament, Confraternities, and days of
special devotion, such as Corpus Christi
and the Forty Hours’ Adoration. It is
translated from the French by an accomplished
lady well fitted for the task, and
has been carefully examined and corrected
by several clergymen of New York
who are distinguished for their learning
and piety. The approbation of the Cardinal
is the best proof of the excellence
of the work, for, apart from the authoritative
character of his sanction, no one is
better able to appreciate a work of this
kind, or to judge of its merits, than His
Eminence; and we are assured that he
has not simply contented himself with
the examination requisite to make sure
that this manual is orthodox in doctrine,
and therefore fit for publication, but has
warmly interested himself in its translation
and preparation for the press, on account
of his high estimate of its value.
In Belgium, where devotion to the Blessed
Sacrament especially flourishes, it is
the favorite book of its kind. The treatise
on frequent communion is especially
thorough and important; and there is
one, also, on the devotion to the Sacred
Heart of Jesus&mdash;a devotion so intimately
connected with that of the Blessed Sacrament
of the Altar. We need not add,
after this, that we recommend the
manual in a special manner to religious
communities, and to the faithful generally.
We trust that their own personal
experience of the benefit and consolation
to be derived from its use will secure
their cordial assent to the praise we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
bestowed upon it, and that it will become
as popular here as it is in Belgium.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Life of Our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
By Louis Veuillot. Translated into
English by the Rev. Anthony Farley.
From the Seventh French Edition.
New York: The Catholic Publication
Society. 1875.</p>

</div>

<p>At last we welcome in English a work
published eleven years ago. Written in
answer to Renan, “It is truly,” says the
translator, “what our Holy Father Pius
IX. calls it, ‘A vindication of the outraged
Godhead of Christ.’” The letter
of the Holy Father is prefixed to the
table of contents.</p>

<p>We transcribe what the translator says
in apology for reproducing the work at
this late hour:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Appearing as it does some time after the existence
of the original work, it might seem that the
object of the book had ceased to be, had been forgotten,
or was of no moment to the public of our day
and of our country. But when we remember the
deep impression produced by Renan’s work&mdash;an impression
stamped (it would seem indelibly) upon the
religious literature and religious teaching of our
times&mdash;we have to admit that a vindication of
Christ, <em>the God-Man</em>, is as necessary to-day as it
was when the new Voltaire appeared to shock religious
sentiment in France and in the world. ‘Christus
heri et hodie,’ is the war-cry of the foes, just as
much as the trust and comfort of the faithful lovers
of the God-Man.”</p>

</div>

<p>Next comes Louis Veuillot’s preface,
which should be read with more attention
than is generally accorded to prefaces.
Indeed, we think few who begin
to read it will hesitate to go through.
The author reminds us that himself was
once a sceptic; and throws a light upon
the unbelieving mind&mdash;upon the cause
and nature of unbelief&mdash;which only such
a man with such an experience can
throw.</p>

<p>His aim in writing Our Lord’s life is to
show the overwhelming force of the simple
Gospel story. He contends (and we
are sure he is right) that, while the “deniers
and falsifiers of the truth have been
admirably refuted in every objection raised
by them,” yet, “since their supreme
art lies in feigning and producing <em>ignorance</em>,
the essential point should be to
reply especially to what they do <em>not</em> say.
This is what we unavoidably forget” (pp.
17, 18). Then, referring to Renan, he
continues:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The last of those wicked impugners of the divinity
of Christ our Lord who has rendered himself
celebrated has well understood, in a book of five or
six hundred pages, how to speak of Jesus Christ
without pointing him out. Perpetually avoiding all
that belongs to God, with the same stroke he perverts
all that belongs to <em>the man</em>. This artifice of
weakness is the only strength of the book. It has
drawn the apologist into the discussion of trifles in
which the Man-God completely disappears. The
refutations are excellent, but they leave us ignorant
of what Jesus Christ has done, and for what purpose
he came into the world. Thus it is not Christ
who has the case gained, yet less the laborious reader
of so much controversy; it is this miserable man,
who has proposed to himself to betray God and his
neighbor.”</p>

</div>

<p>And again:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The clement wisdom of Jesus has not been left
to the mercy of sophists, nor to the resources of reason,
nor to lowliness or feebleness of faith. It has
foreseen the weakness of the mind of man, and has
prepared a succor always victorious. It is not necessary
to ransack the libraries, to collect together
so many dead languages, so much history, so much
physics, so much philosophy, to know with certainty
him who came to save the little ones and the ignorant.
The bread of life is as easy to find as the
material bread, on the same conditions. A simple,
faithful Christian or member of the Church of God,
a man of the world, provided he may have studied
a few books and heard some instruction, can render
an account of his faith far better than the ‘savants,’
the pretended unbelievers, are in a condition to give
an account of their incredulity. The Gospel is
sufficient for that.</p>

<p>“The Gospel contains motives conclusive of the
faith in Jesus Christ, true God and true man&mdash;motives,
reasons, which the Saviour himself has put
forth. We can paralyze, by the contents of the
Gospel, the sophistry of the infidel, without being
shocked by its contact. What does it matter that
the sophist should amass notes against the sincerity
of the Evangelists, if we have clear proof that he
of whom the Evangelists speak is God? On bended
knees, before <em>the Real Presence</em>, one is not tempted
to withdraw from its contemplation in order to consider
or view more closely this vile apparition of
blasphemy. We are by no means bound to extract
from it open avowals of repentance.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then he gives the reason for this sufficiency
of the Gospel:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There are different degrees in the region of the
mind; discussion belongs to the inferior degrees. In
discussing, man is pitted against man; the reason of
the one seems as good as that of the other. In expounding,
we place God against man.</p>

<p>“This exposition of the truth must get the preference
when God is absolutely and personally in the
case. From the apex of those lofty heights the
voice of man properly avoids discussing with nothingness,
lest weak human reason might be inclined
to believe that nothingness could reply; that the
beauty of truth might appear alone in the presence
of the absolute deformity of falsehood.”</p>

</div>

<p>And again:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Among infidels ignorance of the Gospel is generally
complete; among a great many Christians it is
hardly less so. They know the Gospel by heart,
and they do not understand it. They have not
read it with care, with order, such as it has been
delivered. They do not know how to explain it or
meditate on it as they ought. Whosoever sees in
the Gospel only the letter, does not understand even
the letter; and whosoever seeks for morality only in
its pages, does not find the morality they contain.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span></p>

<p>Lastly, he dismisses Renan’s <cite>Life</cite> in
the following masterly words:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As to a certain malicious book which unhappily
signalizes the age in which we live, we have been
obliged to refer to it two or three times. We could
have wished not to touch on it. The first sentiments
of Catholics on this deplorable book have become
much modified since they have been enabled
to perceive more exactly the malicious industry of
the author. While we see him assume the task of
ignoring, we are convinced he is yet far from having
lost the faith. He dare not look upon the crucifix
face to face&mdash;he would fear to see the blood
trickling down. In his conscience he declares himself
a traitor. This is the confession which we read
in his book, turned resolutely away from the light
of day. We blame this miserable man, and we detest
and abhor his crime; but he is to be pitied, and
every Christian will be happy to say to him what
Ananias said to Saul: ‘My brother Saul, the Lord
Jesus, <em>who appeared to you on the road whence
you are coming</em>, has sent me to meet you, so that
you may receive your sight.’”</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p><span class="smcap">A Discourse Commemorative of Hon.
Samuel Williston.</span> By W. S. Tyler,
Williston Professor of Greek in Amherst
College. Springfield, Mass.:
Clark W. Bryan &amp; Co. 1874.</p>

</div>

<p>The venerable gentleman commemorated
in this discourse died on the 18th
of July, 1874, at an advanced age, after a
life which is in many respects remarkable
and worthy of lasting remembrance. His
history is interesting, as presenting the
most distinctive and admirable traits of
the genuine old-fashioned New England
type of character. It is remarkable on
account of the great works which he performed
during his lifetime. It is honorable
and worthy of remembrance on account
of the great example it presents to
wealthy men, of a man who realized the
proper position which men of large fortunes
ought to take in the community, as
public benefactors, as founders, as stewards
of wealth for the common good.
Mr. Williston was the son of a poor
country clergyman whose salary was $300
a year. Disappointed in his early efforts
to obtain a liberal education by an affection
of the eyes which debarred him from
the pleasure of reading all his lifetime,
he set himself to the task of making a
fortune that he might have the means of
promoting education and in other ways
benefiting his fellow-men, especially
those of his own neighborhood and commonwealth.
He was successful in this
undertaking, and, besides the large fortune
which he left at death to his heirs,
he is said to have bestowed a million of
dollars in public beneficent works during
his lifetime, and to have bequeathed
more than half that sum by testament for
similar purposes. He was the second
founder of Amherst College, the founder
of the Williston Seminary at Easthampton,
and of the beautiful town of that
name, which Prof. Tyler says “he found
a mere hamlet, and left one of the richest
and most beautiful towns in Hampshire
County, a great educational and manufacturing
centre, with beautiful farmhouses
(villas they might almost be
called) and several model villages clustered
about elegant churches, and a
model seminary of learning.” Mr. Williston
gained during life, and left after
him, the reputation of a man of integrity,
probity, and high moral principle. His
religious belief, which was that of the
old-fashioned Congregationalists of Massachusetts,
was his guiding and dominating
idea, and he followed it up in practice
consistently and conscientiously.
The portrait prefixed to Prof. Tyler’s
discourse is one very pleasant to look
upon, and shows the face of an honest,
sensible, good man, surmounted by an
expansive, intellectual forehead, and set
firmly upon a manly bust. One excellent
feature in Mr. Williston’s character was
his adherence to the principle that good
education and healthy civilization must
rest on a religious and Christian basis.
In this respect, he contrasts favorably with
a large and increasing class of Protestants,
who are taking sides openly with infidels
in the accursed work of secularizing education,
and crying up merely material or
intellectual progress. His panegyrist,
Prof. Tyler, writes admirably upon this
theme. This discourse, apart from the
interest given to it by the truly noble
life which it describes, is in itself remarkably
full of fine thoughts, showing
the effect of the deep study of the classics
to which the learned author has devoted
his life. We are pleased to notice the
calm and just manner in which he touches
incidentally upon some topics connected
with the Catholic Church. Speaking of
the honor which is due to those men who
are founders of institutions useful to
mankind, in a truly philosophical strain,
and with illustrations drawn from both
pagan and Christian history, he proceeds
to say: “There are no names more hallowed
in the Catholic Church than the
founders of those monasteries which,
with all their sins, have the merit of keeping
religion and learning alive through
the darkness and confusion of the Middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
Ages. The founders, too, of those religious
orders whose influence has been felt
to the remotest bounds of Christendom,
what veneration is felt for them by all
good Catholics, from age to age! The
names of S. Benedict, S. Dominic, S.
Francis, and Ignatius Loyola have been
canonized and embalmed in the religious
societies which they established.” The
fact that these words were pronounced in
the pulpit of the chapel of Amherst College
gives them a peculiar significance.
We do not consider them as denoting any
Catholic tendencies in Prof. Tyler or his
associates, but merely a diminution of
power in the old Protestant and Puritan
tradition, and the existence of a more
philosophical and eclectic spirit. The
rationalizing movement which is disintegrating
Protestant societies carries
away a great deal of prejudice and error
on its tide. It threatens also to sweep
away the remnants and fragments of
truth. Amherst, seated on the remote
hills of Hampshire, has been safer from
the flood, hitherto, than Cambridge and
New Haven. Nevertheless, it must be
invaded by the rising waters in its turn.
There is nothing but the Catholic Church
which can stand, when knowledge and
reason take the place of the ignorance
and credulity necessary to a blind following
of the Reformation. The remnant
of orthodox Protestants must therefore
follow the inexorable logic of Luther’s
principle into its consequences of sheer
rationalism, or make their way back to
Catholic faith. Individuals may remain
stationary, but the mass has to move,
and even the works of men who are both
great and good rest on a sandy foundation,
which will be undermined in a short
time unless they are built on the rock of
Catholic stability. Mr. Williston, we
have no doubt, did his best, not only to
create temporal well-being and prosperity,
but also that which is higher, more
lasting, and directed toward the eternal
good, which is the chief end of man.
Numbers of generous and noble hearts,
like himself, have endeavored and
are now striving toward the same objects,
from the same motives. They are
the pillars of the commonwealth, the
real peers of the realm, the chief bulwark
of our political and social state amid the
horde of base, corrupt intriguers and demagogues,
mammon worshippers and
spendthrifts, crowding our legislative
halls and marts of business, and flaunting
in vulgar show through our streets. It
is impossible, however, that the work
which they strive singly to accomplish,
whether for education, philanthropy, political
reform and progress, or the promotion
of the Christian religion, should be
successfully performed except through
Catholic unity and organization in the
communion of the one true Church. If
all the enlightened and virtuous men and
women in the United States who believe
that Jesus Christ is the Saviour, and
Christianity the salvation of mankind
were united in faith and directed by one
authority, there is nothing which they
could not accomplish on this vast field
which God has given us, and which at
present is to a great extent mere wild
land. In conclusion, we express our
thanks to Mrs. Emily G. Williston and
the other executors of the Hon. Mr.
Williston for their courtesy in sending
us a copy of this discourse, which is
printed in a most beautiful and tasteful
manner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Child.</span> By Mgr. Dupanloup, Bishop
of Orleans. Translated, with the
author’s permission, by Kate Anderson.
Boston: Patrick Donahoe. 1875.</p>

</div>

<p>Mgr. Dupanloup is one of the most
eloquent orators and writers of France.
The theme of the present book, which
might have been handled in an able and
complete and yet dull manner by another,
is treated in a spirited, glowing,
fascinating style by the illustrious Bishop
of Orleans. It is a charming, attractive,
and most important theme, handled by
one who was a most enthusiastic and
successful teacher of boys and youths
before he became a bishop. Every parent,
and especially every mother, should
read this book; so also should those
who have the charge of children and
young people in schools or elsewhere.
It is more specifically and precisely suitable
to the case and condition of boys,
as is natural, considering that the author
has been more immediately engaged in
the care of colleges than of convents.
Yet, in general, its principles and instructions
are appropriate for girls also,
children being very nearly alike in most
respects, whether they are boys or girls.
In respect to the moral training of boys,
there are some instructions very plainly
and yet delicately given in the fourteenth
and fifteenth chapters, which are specially
necessary for a very large class at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
present day and in our very corrupt
state of society. In the wealthy and
fashionable circle of American society,
the children are very generally spoiled.
Who is not familiar with the fast boy of
fourteen, whose outward and visible sign
is a blue ribbon on his straw hat, and
with his sister of twelve, in short clothes,
sparkling with jewelry, but dim-eyed,
pale-faced, and thin, from keeping late
hours and other precocious dissipations?
The end of these fast young people is
usually tragical. If not so, they are at
the best wilted and spoiled, like bouquets
of flowers which have remained for a
whole day among lighted candles.</p>

<p>We regret to say that many of our
wealthy Catholics, especially those who
have suddenly acquired riches, strive to
emulate in the race of extravagance and
luxury the most utterly worldly class of
people, who live professedly for mere
earthly enjoyment. Their children are
therefore trained in a way which is morally
the very opposite of the Christian
and Catholic method. In a lesser degree,
the same loose, indulgent, soft, and
effeminate style of bringing up children
prevails in families where the spirit of
the parents is less worldly and more religious.
Boys and girls do not remain
children long enough, and are not treated
as children ought to be treated. They
are too precociously developed into
young ladies and gentlemen. So far as
our observation extends, the education
at home and at school which our Catholic
boys of the more affluent class are receiving
is much more defective in respect
to religion and morality than that of the
girls. They are more spoiled at home,
and are less amenable to wholesome discipline
and intellectual training at school
than their sisters. They are also exposed
to much greater danger of becoming essentially
irreligious and vicious, and going
utterly to ruin, before or soon after
they attain their majority, and therefore
great errors in their early training are
more deplorable. All parents, and especially
mothers, who are not wholly
careless and frivolous, must perceive
clearly and feel deeply the vital importance
of this subject of the early training
of boys. Let them read carefully and
frequently this choice book of Bishop
Dupanloup, and they will understand
better how to reverence that wonderful
and beautiful being&mdash;a regenerate child;
how to train the child for the duty and
the solid happiness of its earthly life, how
to educate it for heaven.</p>

Thiéblin. Boston: Lee &amp; Shepard;

1875.</p>

</div>

<p>The corps of professional writers for
the great newspapers of Europe and
America is remarkable in many ways for
talent, enterprise, courage, sagacity, and
skill in that style of composition which is
the most effective for the purposes of the
secular press. Its <i lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> is not
very high as regards truth, the eternal
principles of right and devotion to just
and noble causes. It is to a great extent
mercenary, unscrupulous, time-serving,
skeptical, and superficial. Incidentally
it often serves the cause of right and
truth with great efficacy, and no doubt
wages a very successful war on many
evils and abuses in favor of certain temporal
interests, diffuses a vast amount
of information, and contributes its full
quantity of force to the wheels that make
the world spin round with an ever-increasing
velocity. Certain of its members
have made themselves truly famous
in this present age by their explorations
and their chronicles of wars or other
great contemporary events, that almost
rival Livy and Cæsar. It is only necessary
to mention the names of Russell and
Stanley as illustrations of this statement.</p>

<p>Mr. Thiéblin has won a high place
among these brilliant writers for the
press, by his extraordinary courage and
enterprise in following up, first the military
movements of the Franco-Prussian
war, and more recently those of the Carlist
campaigns, and his very great talent
in describing what he has seen and learned
with so much perseverance and effort.
He is a good specimen of the corps to
which he belongs. Apparently a mere
free-thinker in respect to all the higher
order of truth, solicitous only to see and
narrate what is transpiring on the earth,
an intellectual knight-errant and free
lance, without any kind of allegiance to
any power higher than the <cite>Pall Mall
Gazette</cite> or the <cite>New York Herald</cite>, he is
brave, good-humored, witty, and graphic;
a keen observer, a charming narrator,
with a great deal of justice and impartiality,
and evidently telling the truth about
those things which can be apprehended
through the senses, and which his mind
is capable of understanding. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
a few offensive remarks about Catholic
matters, a few jeering allusions to things
beyond his rather limited sphere of
vision, and a moderate quantity of the
usual newspaper political wisdom, upon
which we place, of course, a very low
estimate. The real substance of the
book, however, which is the testimony
of the writer respecting what he learned
by personal observation respecting the
army of Don Carlos and the state of
things in Spain, is of the highest value
and interest. We have not read a book
with so much pleasure for a long time.
The author takes us right into the Carlist
camp and the romantic Vasco Navarrese
country where Don Carlos is king, into
the company of his generals and soldiers,
into the houses of the parish priests, and
among the loyal, religious peasantry.
He has no sympathy with the religion of
the Spaniards or the cause of Don Carlos,
and his favorable testimony to the piety,
morality, bravery, and good discipline of
the faithful soldiers and subjects of the
gallant prince are beyond cavil. The
history of the eccentric and famous Curé
of Santa Cruz is most curious. The
authentic narrative of facts concerning
the Carlist movement makes it evident
to our mind that the prospects of ultimate
and complete success in the effort of
Don Carlos to gain possession of the
kingdom are very encouraging. Mr.
Thiéblin does not confine himself to an
account of his experience in the Carlist
camps. He gives a great deal of information
gathered from the visits he
made to the quarters of the Republicans,
personal observation of the state of things
in Madrid and other places, and conversations
with prominent personages. He
can appreciate what is admirable in
Spain and the Spaniards much better
than most non-Catholics; and being
wholly free from Protestant sympathies,
perceives clearly and ridicules freely the
sham of Evangelical missions with their
invariable concomitant of boastful and
calumnious lying. As a very good sort
of heathen, and an extremely clever man,
with a fine taste for what is beautiful, and
an eclectic habit of mind, he gives just
and charming descriptions of many
things in that Catholic country and people&mdash;in
short, understanding the principles
and causes which have produced
that which he partially approves, but cannot
estimate at its full worth, as he would
do if he were a thorough and intelligent
Catholic, in respect to the state of
Catholic religion and piety in Spain, his
account of the lapse from ancient faith is
partly correct, but one-sided and imperfect,
as that of a foreign and anti-Catholic
observer must be. In respect to morality
and general well-being and happiness,
he is a competent witness, and his testimony
shows how much better, happier,
and more refined, in the true sense, the
Spanish people, even in their present
disorganized state are, than the mass of
the population in England or the United
States. In regard to Spanish politics, he
sympathizes, of course, most perfectly
with Castelar and the orderly, moderate
Republicans, and next to these with the
party of Don Alfonso. He makes an
elaborate argument in favor of the claim
of this young prince to be the inheritor
of all the rights of Ferdinand VII. In
our opinion, Don Carlos has the most
valid title to this inheritance. But as we
have no time to prove this, we must
waive the question of legitimacy.</p>

<p>There is another right which has precedence
of any right to inherit the throne:
This is the right of the Church and nation
to have restored and preserved the
ancient heritage of the Spanish nation,
those laws and institutions, and that
government which are necessary to the
religious and political well being of the
whole people. The régime of the Christinos
was destructive to both, and almost
the whole nation acquiesced in the expulsion
of Isabella. We do not think
that the majority of even that portion of
the Spaniards who are at present subject
to Don Alfonso really consent to his
rule, or that there is any guarantee that
it will be better than that of the late
queen. He has been taken up by the
Liberals as a <i lang="fr">pis aller</i>, and is only tolerated
by the greater part of those who
are loyal to the religion and constitution
of the Spanish monarchy. Don Carlos,
as his own published statements, particularly
his recent letter to Louis Veuillot,
prove, is the champion of religious and
political regeneration. It is, therefore,
desirable that his claim to the crown
should be lawfully ratified, and receive
whatever may be requisite to make it a
perfect right in actual possession, by the
act of the Spanish nation. We may say
the same of the Comte de Chambord in
respect to the throne of France. This is
a sufficient reason why Catholics, even
American Catholics, who are faithful to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
the Republic here, because it is an established
and legitimate order, should be
hostile to the Republican party in Spain
and France, and to any kind of patched-up
liberalistic monarchy in either country,
and wish for the success of Don
Carlos and Henri de Bourbon. There
are some very good Catholics who think
differently, even such staunch champions
of the Catholic cause as our illustrious
friend the Bishop of Salford, the editor
of the <cite>London Tablet</cite>, and Dr. Ward.
They seem to us to be mistaken and inconsistent,
and we agree personally with
the <cite>Civiltà Cattolica</cite> and the <cite>Univers</cite> that
the cause of Charles VII. and Henry V.
is the same with that of Pius IX. considered
as a temporal sovereign, and
closely connected with the triumph of
his rights as Sovereign Pontiff. We have,
moreover, the confident hope that the
one will yet reign over regenerated
Spain and the other over regenerated
France, after the infamous Prussian tyranny
shall have been trampled in the
dust, and the usurper of the Quirinal
shall have met the fate of all foregoing
oppressors of the Holy See.</p>

<h3>THE PERSECUTION IN SWITZERLAND
FROM THE REVUE GENERALE.</h3>

<p>For seven months have we kept
silence on the religious persecution
in Switzerland. Not that during
that interval the rage of the persecutors
has become appeased; very
far from it. But the spectacle they
afford is so repulsive to the conscience
that the pen falls from the
hand in disgust whilst narrating
their exploits. Nevertheless, we
suppose it may be of service to give
a complete although succinct history
of the violence and hypocrisy
of Swiss liberalism. And for that
reason we renew our recital.</p>

<p>Up to the present time, the persecution
has only raged in two dioceses,
the smallest, Geneva, and the
largest, Basel. But elsewhere the
fire smoulders beneath the ashes,
and everything goes to prove that,
if the liberals should succeed in
overthrowing the church in the
cantons where they have inaugurated
their barbarous and intolerant
rule, they will continue their efforts
even into the heart of the country.
Already, indeed, here and there,
outside of the two just-named dioceses,
they reveal their intentions
by isolated measures.</p>

<p>Thus at St. Gall, the cantonal
council, the majority of which consists
of Protestants and free-thinkers,
has forbidden the Catholic
clergy to teach the Syllabus and
the dogma of Papal Infallibility;
and, as the clergy have refused to
obey such an order, the Council of
Public Instruction has withdrawn
from them the teaching the catechism
during Lent, and has placed
the duty in the hands of schoolmasters
in absolute dependence on
the state. This example betrays
the intention of liberalism, in the
name of liberty, no longer to tolerate
any religion but such as is fashioned
by its own hand. This intention
is now betraying itself openly
in the two dioceses of Geneva and
Basel. It is useless to speak of
the rights of Catholics consecrated
by treaties, to invoke the respect
due to their conscience; useless is
it to adduce in their behalf the religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
equality which they scrupulously
maintain in the cantons,
such as Lucerne and Freyburg,
where they have the superiority;
useless to insist on their patriotism,
and on their loyal submission to
laws which do not encroach on the
domain of religion. No, there are no
rights for Catholics, there is no justice
for them; and when it is a
question of attacking them, the end
justifies the means.</p>

<p>This is no invention of ours. We
will cite a few examples in support
of our assertion.</p>

<p>M. Teuscher in the canton of
Bern, and M. Carteret at Geneva,
have founded churches to which
they have assigned the name of
Catholic, which they support with
unusual zeal. Now, in the journal
of these churches, the <cite>Démocratie
catholique</cite>, which is published at
Bern, of the date of January 2, is
the following statement: “Ultramontanes
are malefactors, and there
is no liberty for malefactors.” It
may be objected, that these words
are merely the expression of an individual
opinion. Let us listen
then to M. Carteret, speaking, about
the same time, before the Grand
Council of Geneva: “Ultramontanism
is dangerous; it is necessary
to combat it, to make on it a war of
extermination and without mercy;
it is affectation to dream of being
just and equitable with such an
adversary.” A little later on, in the
same assembly, a credit was voted
for the maintenance of candidates
for Catholic cures, whose rightful
possessors had been arbitrarily
ejected; and when M. Vogt expressed
his astonishment that the
canton should keep a tavern for
liberal <i lang="fr">abbés</i>, a deputy exclaimed,
“We shall act as we please.”</p>

<p>It would seem impossible for
cynicism to go beyond this. But
no; the brutality of despotism
was able to surpass even it. At the
moment when, in the canton of
Soleure, the people were summoned
to vote the suppression of the secular
foundations, of which we shall
speak presently, one of their journals
published the following: “If
we should be conquered, and the
<em>blacks</em> should defeat the measure,
<em>we shall handle the knife</em>.” It
sounds like a sinister echo of
1793.</p>

<p>What can be the object of the
persecutors? Is it the substitution
of Protestantism for Catholicity?
Scarcely. Protestants who really
believe in their religion disapprove
of these iniquities. The object is
akin, rather, we may be sure, to the
sentiment lately given utterance to
by the Pastor Lang of Zurich:
“We are slowly but surely approaching
the end towards which
the development of our spiritual
life is urging us, to wit, <em>the suppression
and disappearance of all churches</em>.”
The same sentiment had been
expressed during the debates on
the federal revision by M. Welti.
“He who would wish to be free
must not belong to any church.
No church gives liberty. The
<em>state</em> alone gives that.” In other
words, the ideal to be aimed at is
the reign of the state over soul
as well as body. After this, can
we wonder at the cry of alarm
issuing from a quarter not at least
to be suspected of Catholic bias?
It is a Protestant journal&mdash;<cite>l’Union
jurassienne</cite>&mdash;which exclaims, “The
star of liberty pales, the shadows
of spiritual despotism are gathering
around us.” But the cry is
lost in the desert. Despotism
throws those who exercise it into a
kind of intoxication; every one of
the excesses to which it commits
itself becomes the source of fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
ones. Its last word is proscription,
when it is not the scaffold.…
In the diocese of Basel the
crimes of liberalism have been perpetrated
principally at Soleure, in
the Jura, and at Bern. We will review
them successively.</p>

<p>At Soleure, the Benedictine monastery
of Maria-Stein, the collegiate
church of Schoenwerth, and that
of S. Urs and S. Victor have been
overthrown at one stroke.</p>

<p>The monastery of Maria-Stein
was founded in 1085, and had
cleared and cultivated the country.
But the church can no more
reckon upon the gratitude of its
enemies than upon their justice.
They determined to seize the property
of the convent, to convert the
building into a madhouse, and to
mock justice with the bestowal of
a trifling alms on the religious thus
iniquitously dispossessed. At the
first news of this project, the ex-Father
Hyacinthe again gave expression
to the indignation he had
exhibited before on similar provocation,
and sent to the abbot of the
monastery a protest against “this
attack on property and religion.”</p>

<p>The foundation of the collegiate
church of Schoenwerth, situated
near Olten, dates from the Xth
century. It had only five canons,
who served four parishes, and gave
instruction in the schools. That
of S. Urs and S. Victor from the
VIIIth. It was erected into a
cathedral in 1828; when the residence
of the Bishop of Basel was
transferred to Soleure. Its chapter
has kept perpetual watch for nearly
a thousand years at the tombs of
the Theban martyrs. These venerable
memories arrested not the
arms of the spoilers. What was
wanted was to punish the canons
of Schoenwerth and of Soleure for
their loyalty to their bishop, and at
the same time to get possession of
the endowments they administered.</p>

<p>Consequently, the suppression of
the two collegiate churches, as
well as of the monastery of Maria-Stein,
was submitted to the popular
vote. It was adopted by 8,356
votes against 5,896. But when it
is remembered that the majority
included about 3,000 Protestants,
besides the manufacturing population
of Olten, who are in complete
subjection to the tyranny of their
Freemason employers; that more
than 3,000 timid Catholics abstained
from voting, and that the women
and children were not consulted,
there can remain no doubt
that once again a Catholic majority
has been sacrificed to a coalition
of Protestants and free-thinkers.</p>

<p>However it may be, this vote remarkably
facilitated the object the
liberals have had in view for some
time, namely, of abolishing the
chapter of Basel. This chapter
consisted of canons from seven
states of the diocese&mdash;Bern, Basel,
Thurgau, Aargau, Soleure, Zug,
Lucerne. The state of Soleure
having suppressed its own, and
the states of Aargau and Bern
being urged to do the same to
theirs, the conference of the diocesan
states, on the 21st December,
decreed the suppression of the
chapter itself and the sale of its
effects. The support of five of
these states had been procured.
No heed was taken of the opposition
of Lucerne and Zug.</p>

<p>And it is asserted that it is in
the name of religious liberty that
Swiss liberalism has deprived the
diocese of Basel of its bishop and
its chapter! But what cares liberalism
for the rights of Catholic
consciences? However, in thus
decapitating the diocese it was carrying
out a purpose on which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
was inexorably bent. It had
long resolved to create a national
church calling itself Catholic, and
it hugged the illusion that the suppression
of the Catholic bishoprics
would contribute to the success of
this design. It is in pursuance of
the same object that it opened in
Bern, in the month of October, a
faculty of Old Catholic theology.</p>

<p>These facts display a complete
change of tactics on the part of unbelief.
In the last century, Voltaire
and his satellites tried to batter
down the church, without dreaming
of putting anything in her
place. They failed. Their successors
of to-day adopt another plan.
It is to create anti-Catholic
churches, calling themselves Catholic,
to which they do not belong,
whose dogmas they abjure,
and whose priests they despise.
They trust thus to satisfy the people,
whilst retaining for themselves
the benefits of unbelief.</p>

<p>Next, in the month of October,
the government of Bern opened, in
the federal capital, a faculty of
theology, which it called “faculty
of Catholic theology,” and it invited
chiefly foreigners to occupy its
chairs. It nominated dean of the
faculty a German, that unfortunate
Dr. Friedrich of Munich, who was
amongst the first to follow Döllinger
in his perversity, and they appointed
as his subordinates a few
apostates picked up wherever they
could find them. Eight students,
almost all from the canton of Soleure,
the real focus of Swiss liberalism,
were enrolled. With such
a contingent, the dream of a national
church does not appear certain
to be realized. But the government
of Bern flatters itself that
in time the number of students will
increase, and that it will thus have
at its disposal submissive agents
ready to assist it in its detestable
undertaking, the perversion of the
Jura.</p>

<p>The Jura! It is impossible to
cast a glance around that unfortunate
country without being filled
with gratitude to God for the religious
heroism it perseveres in displaying
in the presence of a powerful
and treacherous enemy who is
striving to crush it utterly.</p>

<p>It is notorious that the ninety-seven
parishes of the Jura have been arbitrarily
reconstructed by the government
of Bern; and that, after
having reduced them to the number
of twenty-five, it finally increased
them to forty-two. Nothing
has been left undone to place at
the head of every one of these an
apostate priest. But in spite of all
its efforts it has only been able to
muster seventeen. Besides, what
trouble do the recruits swept up
from all the by-ways of Europe
cause them! Some have already
sent in their resignation.</p>

<p>Thus it was with Giaut, curate
of Bonfol, who, in a public letter
announced his abandonment of the
mission he had assumed, “because
he saw no immediate prospect of the
realization, in the Jura, of his aspirations
and ideas.” Of the same
kind was the course pursued by
d’Omer Camerle, who, on his withdrawal,
declared that the new clergy,
“utterly despised by the liberals
and execrated by the ultramontanes,
were attempting a work which was
entirely useless if not contemptible.”
Others have been obliged to escape,
or had to evade justice.</p>

<p>We have before narrated the misfortunes
of Rupplin. His rival
Naudot, arrested for abduction of
a minor, was condemned to six
months’ imprisonment. In his defence,
made by himself, he demanded,
“Am I more guilty than Giaut,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
<i lang="fr">curé</i> of Bonfol, who calls himself
Guiot; than Choisel, <i lang="fr">curé</i> of Courgenay,
whose real name is Chastel;
than Déramey, who calls himself
Pipy?” We must, however, state
to his credit that he abjured his
errors and returned into the bosom
of the church.</p>

<p>At Bienne, the intruder, St. Ange
Lièvre, threw off the mask, and
married a Protestant named Tsantré-Boll.
The union was blessed
by M. Saintes, a Protestant minister,
after an address by M. Hurtault,
from Geneva, who complimented
his colleague “for having
had the courage to throw off the
yoke of bondage imposed upon him
by the Roman papacy.” This was
overshooting the mark. The intruders
may commit all imaginable escapades
without provoking attention.
But they must not marry. It reveals
prematurely the programme
of the free-thinkers of Bern, who,
in order to conciliate the population
of the Jura, declare that they
have no intention to meddle with
the dogmas of the church. Accordingly,
the “Provisionary Catholic
Synodal Commission,” in a letter
addressed to “MM. the curates of
the Jura,” “severely rebuked the
deplorable example given by M. St.
Ange Lièvre, and promised to demand
from the authorities a remedy,
which could not be refused if
another member of the clergy should
venture to violate the venerable
laws of the church.” Ludicrous
imbecility! They will try to hinder
for the future a renewal of these
wanton freaks, but they respect
what has been already perpetrated.
And so M. Lièvre and his Protestant
wife remain at the head of the
parish of Bienne!</p>

<p>But do any of the intruded meet
with success in their propaganda?
No! At Alle, Salis rings the bell
for Masses which he does not say.
At Bienne, only twenty or thirty
persons attend the service of St.
Ange Lièvre. At Delémont, the
chief place of the district, enjoying
a radical priest, a radical president
of the tribunal, radical functionaries,
so empty is the church usurped
by Portaz-Grassis that, on the 7th
of January, the council of the parish
gave vent to the following cry
of distress in a circular addressed
to “Liberal Catholics”: “The religious
question in the Jura being
intimately associated with the political
one, it is important, now that
our national church is constituted
on solid and legal foundations, that
all liberals should support this
church and sustain the majority of
the Bernese people in the steps that
have been taken. [It must be remembered
that the majority of the
Bernese people is Protestant.]</p>

<p>“Yet is our worship little frequented,
and our enemies proclaim
everywhere that our church is deserted.</p>

<p>“In presence of this carelessness&mdash;we
may say, even of this culpable
indifference&mdash;we make a last
appeal to the patriotic sentiments
of the liberal Catholics of Delémont,
beseeching them to assist more
regularly at the Sunday Mass, and
above all to induce their wives and
children to be present at it. If
Catholics [!] will not show more
zeal in supporting the liberal curate
and the council of the parish, the
latter will resign <i lang="la">in globo</i> the charge
entrusted to it.”</p>

<p>Nothing, however, discourages
the government of Bern, and in conformity
with the law of worship,
voted some months ago, it has obliged
the new parishes of the Jura to
proceed to the formation of parochial
councils, and to the nomination,
or rather confirmation, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
intruding curates. But here, also,
what deception! Out of 12,000
electors, only the tenth part voted.
In 28 communes, not a single elector
presented himself at the ballot.
In the others, the number was
laughably small. At St. Imier, for
instance, out of 1,933 electors, only
eight answered the summons. At
Moustier, out of 1,429, only 24.
No less significant are the numbers
of votes polled for the elected curates:</p>

<p>Fontenais: M. d’Abbadie (Frenchman)
had 77 votes out of 1,651
electors.</p>

<p>Courtemaiche: M. Coffignal
(Frenchman) had 15 votes out of
1,683 electors.</p>

<p>Undervelier: M. Salis (Italian)
had 13 votes out of 1,046 electors.</p>

<p>Courroux: M. Maestrelli (Italian)
had 60 votes out of 1,557 electors.</p>

<p>Roggenburg: M. Oser (German)
had 40 votes out of 465 electors.</p>

<p>Bislach: M. Schoenberger (German)
had 33 votes out of 669 electors.</p>

<p>Dittengen: M. Fuchs (Austrian)
had 33 votes out of 667 electors.</p>

<p>Bienne: M. St. Ange Lièvre
(Frenchman) had 50 votes out of
1,040 electors.</p>

<p>Imagine the Bernese government
being eager to confirm nominations
made under such circumstances!</p>

<p>As to the Catholics, they continue
to assemble in barns and cart-sheds,
and there to lift with faith
their hands towards heaven, and to
rest firm in their fidelity. This attitude
only aggravates the rage of
their persecutors. We have already
spoken of the suppression of the
Ursulines of Porrentruy. The last
remaining religious congregation in
that town could not long escape the
same fate. It was that of the Sisters
of Charity of Ste. Ursanne, who
had for twenty years ministered in
the hospital for the poor of the
chief town of the Bernese Jura.
They began with seizing their chapel
and handing it over to schism.
Then, without any pretext, they
cast into prison the Superior and
two of the Sisters, where they remained
four days. At length, one
fine morning, they were informed
that they must leave the place within
four hours; at the expiration of
which period, if they had not left,
“they would be forcibly expelled.”
The execution soon followed the
sentence; and these religious ladies,
whose presence had only been
known by good works, were, in
their turn, compelled to tread the
path of exile!</p>

<p>In spite of the implacable intolerance
of their enemies, the Jurassians
do not cease petitioning the
federal authorities; and to the
number of 9,000 they have demanded
the restitution of their
churches and of their ecclesiastical
property, the re-establishment of the
Catholic worship, and the recall of
the 97 priests unjustly expelled.
The restitution of the churches,
and the re-establishment of the Catholic
as a public worship, have
been flatly refused, on the plea
that there cannot exist in the canton
any other public Catholic worship
than that established by the
law of January, 1874! But the federal
council, notwithstanding its
notorious hostility, shrunk from an
open and avowed approbation of
the ostracism of the faithful priests;
and it requested of the Bernese
government an explanation of the
reasons which, in its opinion, justified
the continuance of that rigorous
measure; reserving to itself to give
a subsequent decision on the appeal
which had been made to it.</p>

<p>Opinions are divided as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
real intentions of the federal council,
and at the moment when we
write the definitive decision has
not been announced. But whatever
may be the fate of the appeal,
the situation of the church in the
Jura will remain no less lamentable.</p>

<p>Whilst the Jurassian population
give, thus, an example of fidelity
worthy of the first ages of the
Christian era, the tempest has burst
upon the Catholic parish of the
town of Bern.</p>

<p>This parish possesses a church
built by the late Mgr. Baud, predecessor
of the present curate, M.
Perroulaz, and paid for by the alms
of the Catholics of the entire country.
The schismatics cast longing eyes
upon it; but their designs were for
a while impeded by the fear of displeasing
the ambassadors. This
fear was unfounded. For since
the overthrow of governments caused
by the detestable policy of
Napoleon III., there is no longer an
Europe; and everywhere violence
and injustice, having nothing to
fear from the once protective influence
of the great powers, commit
themselves to every license. It is
thus, then, they set about to compass
their end.</p>

<p>First, an assembly of the parish
was convoked to elect a parochial
council. But as such an assembly
owes its existence to the late law
of worship, and as the faithful Catholics
could not consequently take
any part in it, the council was
chosen by one hundred out of three
hundred and sixty electors. Scarcely
was it installed when it received
a request from the professors of the
Old Catholic faculty of Bern, that
the church might be placed at their
disposition, for their Masses, worship,
and preachings. It eagerly
acceded to this request, and desired
M. Perroulaz to open the gates
of the church to the schismatic
priests of the university. He refused.
They ordered him to give up
the keys. He did nothing of the
kind. They went to his house and
took them from him; and on Sunday,
28th February, Dr. Friedrich
and his accomplices took possession
of the sanctuary. M. Perroulaz, to
avoid scandal, assembled his parishioners
for the celebration of their
worship in the great hall of the
Museum. Thither they flocked in
crowds. Foremost amongst the
worshippers were the ambassadors
of France, Austria, Italy, Spain,
Portugal, Brazil, etc. Thirty years
ago, such a demonstration of the
diplomatic body would not have
remained without results. But in
the year of grace 1875, “might
makes right,” and the petty tyrants
of Bern, supported by certain foreign
cabinets, satiate with impunity
their hatred of the church.</p>

<p>But even this did not content
them. It was not sufficient for
them to have deprived Catholics of
their church. They wanted, further,
to compel M. Perroulaz to
say Mass in it together with the
apostates. The Council of State
designed, in this way, to place him
in a position in which they might
be able, in due form of law, to relieve
him of his functions. On his
refusal it decided to institute a
process of revocation; and, pending
the trial, it suspended him!
Then he was driven out of the
presbytery, and a Bavarian impostor
was installed in his place.
What! After having despoiled the
faithful of the sanctuary built by
their own hands and with their own
money, they command them, besides,
to make common cause with
renegades, and make it a crime in
their pastor to assemble them elsewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
to adore God according to
their conscience. At Rome, under
the pagan emperors, the Christians
had the freedom of the Catacombs;
at Bern, in 1875, even such freedom
would be grudged by the ingrates
whose cradle was enlightened by
the rays of divine truth!</p>

<p>At Geneva affairs are as gloomy
as in the canton of Bern. Last
August, at the moment when we were
relating the high-handed proceedings
of the government, M. Loyson
had just distinguished himself by
breaking his connection with the lay
chiefs of the schism. “I will not
engage,” he said, “in useless discussions
with men who confound
liberalism with radicalism, Catholicism
with the <cite>Profession of Faith</cite>
of the Savoyard vicar.” The poor
apostate would, we suspect, have
been but too glad to return to the
venerable church which received
his first oaths. But how dispose
of Mme. Loyson and the little Emmanuel?
He continued therefore
schismatic, and he announced that
he should remain at Geneva “until
the election of a bishop, who, with
his synod, was the only authority,”
he added, “which he could recognize
in the religious order.” In
pursuance of this secession, he
founded a free worship, which has a
small number of sectaries as its
following.</p>

<p>As to the official church, its misfortunes
are beyond calculation.
The town of Geneva itself was
favored with three curates, each
receiving from four to five thousand
francs a year, and a few vicars.
After the retirement of M. Loyson,
the second of the three curates&mdash;M.
Hurtault&mdash;left, in order to occupy
one of the chairs of the Old
Catholic faculty at Bern. It was,
no doubt, to console the new church
in these bereavements, that one of
the vicars, M. Vergoin, in imitation
of his accomplices, took to himself
a wife in the person of a Freyburg
damsel.</p>

<p>However, the law of the organization
of religious worship enjoined
on all the curates and vicars of the
canton the oath of obedience to the
laws. The Council of State shrunk
for a long time from the application
of this provision in the rural communes.
At length, yielding to the
impatience of the “Catholic Superior
Council,” it decreed that the
oath should be taken on the 4th
September by the seventeen curates
and the two vicars officiating in the
country.</p>

<p>On the appointed day, a large
crowd assembled around the entrance
of the town-hall. Not a
priest summoned presented himself.
They, too, were proud to wear the
device of Mgr. Lachat: <i lang="la">Potius mori
quam fœdari!</i>&mdash;“Death rather than
shame!”</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards, the Council
of State pronounced the aforesaid
cures vacant, and suppressed
the pay of their occupiers from
October 31. This measure was
communicated to the “Catholic
Superior Council,” with the view
of its filling the vacancies.</p>

<p>Great was the embarrassment of
the latter. As a commencement,
it demanded of the Council of State
the power of disposing of the country
churches from the 31st October.
The reply was that it had only to
apply to the municipal authorities.
It then devised the plan of publishing
in the journals, amongst the
advertisements, a notice to the effect
that “the registry was open at the
office of the superior council for
the offices of curate and vicar in
twenty-two parishes of the canton,
which had become vacant in consequence
of death, dismissal, and revocation.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
When at length it had
found a candidate, it resolved to
present him to the parish of Grand-Saconnex,
one of the nearest to
Geneva, and which on that account
appeared to it to be ripe for schism.
But only thirty-three electors out
of one hundred and sixty-six responded
to the call. It was less
than a third, and the election was
abortive in consequence.</p>

<p>Such a check was suggestive.
The measure decreed on the 4th
September was not put in force,
except that the salaries of the faithful
curates remained suppressed.
But they revenged themselves by
annoying the Catholics in every
possible way.</p>

<p>We will cite two instances.</p>

<p>An Old Catholic interment having
taken place at Hermance, after
several provocations, the population
threw some stones on the
coffin of the defunct. The blame
was immediately laid on the curate,
and he was expelled from the canton
on the pretext that “he troubled
the public peace,” said the decree,
“by his preachings, and excited
hatred of one another among
the citizens.” No accusation could
be more serious than this. For,
indeed, had he been guilty of it, it
was before the courts he should
have been brought. But all that
was wanted then was to punish the
parishioners for having, a few days
before, given an ill reception to
two intruders who had attempted
to pervert the village.</p>

<p>The second is a yet sadder incident.
One fine day, an Old Catholic
inhabitant of Geneva, named
Maurice, who lived close to the
Old Catholic church, took it into
his head to have his infant child
baptized by the intruding priest,
Marchal, in the Catholic Church
of Compesières, used for two communes,
Bardonnex and Plan-les-Ouates.
On the arrival of the cortége,
the mayors of these communes,
habited in their scarfs of office, and
surrounded by their subordinates,
opposed its entry into the church,
and forced it to beat a retreat. At
the news of this there was great
consternation at Geneva.</p>

<p>The whim of M. Maurice was
not only a violation of the liberty
of religion; it was a wanton provocation,
since he belonged to the
commune of Geneva, and could
have had his child baptized in the
church of S. Germain, of which the
schism had taken possession. No
matter. The Council of State took
advantage of the incident, and ordered
the mayors of Compesières
to keep the parish church open for
baptism of the little Maurice. At
the same time it ordered thither
some squadrons of gendarmes and
of carabineers, and, thanks to this
display of the public force, a locksmith
was able to force open the
doors of the sacred edifice. They
had it sealed with the borough-seal,
and a huge placard was stuck on it,
bearing the following inscription:
“Property is inviolable.” Before
the profanation, a delegate from the
communal authorities of Bardonnex
and of Plan-les-Ouates had communicated
to the invaders a final protest.</p>

<p>Any commentary would be superfluous.
We limit ourselves to
quoting the following words of the
<cite>Journal de Genève</cite>: “What has
passed at Compesières has but too
quickly justified the mournful forebodings
inspired by the violent
policy which is growing from bad
to worse in official quarters. We
persist in demanding that a stop be
put to this sowing the wind at the
risk of reaping the whirlwind.”
But the object had been achieved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
The Catholics had been outraged,
and a pretext had been made for
dismissing M. de Montfalcon, mayor
of Plan-les-Ouates and president
of “l’Union des Campagnes.”</p>

<p>It appears, however, that this was
not enough. In the bosom of the
“Catholic Superior Council,” M.
Héridier exclaimed: “We must follow
the course of the Bernese government.”
Such bitter hatred can
only be accounted for by the negative
results of the country enterprise.
The firmness of the Catholics,
in fact, increases, instead of
growing fainter, and they are unanimous
in adopting the sentiments
of a speaker of the “Union des Campagnes,”
who exclaimed lately:
“Whatever happens we will not be
found wanting. If they despoil us
of our churches, they can only take
the walls; they cannot take our
souls. We will follow our stripped
and proscribed altars even into the
poverty of a barn or the darkness
of a cavern. If they hunt our
priests from their presbyteries, we
will offer them an asylum under
our modest and friendly roofs. If
they rob them of their salaries, we
will share with them the wages of
our labor and the bread of our
tables.”</p>

<p>A special cause of irritation to
the liberals and free-thinkers was
the circumstance that scarcely had
the Catholics been despoiled of the
church of S. Germain before they
bought, to replace it, the Temple
Unique, formerly occupied by the
Freemasons, and which they dedicated
to the Sacred Heart. Accordingly,
no sooner had the elections
for the renewal of the Grand
Council given a majority to M.
Carteret, before that gentleman set
to work to inflict a fresh blow upon
the Catholics, by robbing them of
the Church of Notre Dame. This
magnificent church was built in
1857 by means of subscription
collected throughout the Christian
world by Mgr. Mermillod,
and M. Dunoyer, the dismissed
curate of Geneva. The subscriptions
had been given, we need
scarcely say, on the faith of the
Catholic worship, and that alone,
being celebrated in the church;
and for seventeen years no other
had been celebrated there.</p>

<p>For a long while M. Carteret
and the free-thinking liberals had
been casting longing looks on this
prey. They had been impeded in
their designs by energetic resistance,
and, amongst others, by that
of the ex-Father Hyacinthe. But
at last they lost patience, and at
their instigation, backed by the
pressure of a populace whose worst
passions they had inflamed, the
Grand Council, at the beginning
of January, adopted an order of
the day requiring the prompt execution
of the law of 2d November,
1850.</p>

<p>This law, which had bestowed
upon Catholics the land on which
the sacred edifice is built, enacted
that the administration of the
church should be entrusted to
a commission of five members,
chosen by the Catholics of the
parish of Geneva. By demanding
the putting in force of this clause,
they hoped to form a commission
of Old Catholics who would hand
over the church to the radicals concealed
under a schismatic mask.</p>

<p>We do not intend to discuss here
the question of right; although it
appears clear to us that they could
not justly turn against Catholics a
stipulation which had been made
expressly in their favor. The mere
equity of the case should have sufficed
to prevent, under existing circumstances,
the application of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
clause. This was the view taken
by two distinguished Protestants
who had not abandoned all regard
for justice&mdash;M. Naville and M. de
la Rive. The latter, in a remarkable
production, observed: “There
is not, I think, an impartial mind,
which, looking at the matter from
the point of view of simple equity,
will not decide in favor of that
one of the two churches which has
borne the whole of the large outlay
by which the value of the original
grant has been increased more than
tenfold. The spot on which now
stands one of the most splendid
monuments of our city would be
still a waste space but for the sums
collected and furnished precisely
by those persons whose possession
of it is now disputed. Notre
Dame is exclusively the work
of the priests and faithful of the
Catholic Church. That is a notorious,
undisputed fact.”</p>

<p>There could be no reply to language
so true and striking. Moreover,
one of those who had collected
the subscriptions, in a published
letter, stated that “the principal
part of the sums employed in the
erection of the building had been
subscribed by Roman Catholics
throughout the world, and that he
could assert and prove that those
who are separated from the Catholic
Church had nothing whatsoever
to do with its construction.”</p>

<p>But these protests were useless.
Had, however, the sectaries the
pretence that they were in a majority
in Geneva, and that they had
need of Notre Dame? By no
means. And the <cite>Chronique radical</cite>
remarked it, demanding: “What
will you do with the church of Notre
Dame? Can you fill it?” Indeed,
no! They will never be able
to fill it. But the object was to
wrest it from the faithful&mdash;from those
who flocked to it in crowds, whose
registry records, in 1874, 260 Baptisms,
170 Burials, 60 Marriages,
174 First Communions, and 30,000
Communions of adults; and for
whom five Masses were celebrated
every Sunday. Here, once more
the end justifies the means.</p>

<p>The Council of State, moved
thus to put in force the law of 1850,
convoked the electoral body, deciding,
as a preliminary, that the citizens
of Geneva alone should take
part in the election. To understand
the importance of this qualification
it will suffice to observe
that there are in the canton of Geneva
25,000 Catholic foreigners,<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
and that, by depriving them of the
right of voting, the Catholic strength
would be seriously weakened.</p>

<p>In spite of this subterfuge, there
was every prospect of victory for
the faithful, when, on the very eve
of the elections, the 6th February,
during the afternoon, the number
of electors which, in the morning,
stood at 1,500 only, was raised to
1,924. Whence these recruits at
the last moment had been procured
may be easily conjectured. The
<cite>Courrier de Genève</cite> asserted that it
saw come to the poll “a band of
unknown individuals who appeared
to be formed in brigades.”</p>

<p>Thanks to this reinforcement, the
free-thinking list obtained a majority
of 187 votes.</p>

<p>The commission thus elected immediately
entered upon its duties,
and instead of taking their church
away from the Catholics, it hurriedly
decided that “the inhabitants of
the right bank of the Rhone and
of the Lake, who belong to the
religion recognized by the state,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>
should be at liberty to perform in
the temple the ceremonies of Baptism,
Marriage, and Burial,” and
that it reserved for itself to take
what steps it might deem advisable
to take against ecclesiastics who
should give occasion to just complaints,
specially in aught that concerns
the public peace, obedience
to the laws, and the respect due to
magistrates.</p>

<p>These resolutions were on the
point of being executed when
Mgr. Mermillod, M. Dunoyer, as
representatives of the subscribers,
and M. Lany, rector of Notre
Dame, claimed, before the courts,
the ownership of the edifice.</p>

<p>Do judges still exist at Geneva?
It remains to be seen.</p>

<p>But this was not all. On the 6th
April, at five o’clock in the morning,
the recently-elected commission
had the doors of the church
broken open by a locksmith, protected
by a squad of gendarmes
and police-agents; after which
seals were placed on the doors,
and further worship interdicted!</p>

<p>The situation becomes thus
more and more critical. M. Carteret
envies M. Bismarck his laurels,
and, supported by all that is
evil in Geneva, we must expect to
see him rush headlong to the utmost
extremities. Far distant, indeed,
is the time when one could
talk of Swiss liberty. The violence
of every description which
has gone on increasing in the old
Helvetic land demonstrates that
despotism can run riot as savagely
under a republican form of government
as under any other; and that
they who cry out the most lustily
against the tyranny of kings are
themselves tyrants of the worst
kind when they have power in
their hands.</p>

<p>It is clear that in the course they
are pursuing the Swiss radicals
will not suffer themselves to be
distanced by any one. They have
formed a vast association, called
the <cite>Volksverein</cite>, at one of whose
meetings, held at Olten last autumn,
a programme was voted containing
the following clause: “The
moment has arrived for the application
of the principles which are
the foundation of the new federal
party. In order to crush for ever
the influence of Ultramontanism
it is not enough to emancipate
from the church the individual as
such, it is necessary that churches
themselves should be governed democratically
and nationally and
that every hierarchical institution
be suppressed, as dangerous to the
state and to liberty; and that, by
virtue of Art. 50 of the new constitution,
the existing bishoprics be
suppressed by the federal assembly.”
The hypocrites! They dare
to take the name of liberty upon
their lips! True, the “National
Convention,” and the Paris “Commune,”
they too scribbled the word
everywhere!</p>

<p>The demonstrations, the principal
of which we have indicated, must
end in the definitive constitution of
the projected national church, before
which all will be expected to
bow the knee, as the pagans demanded
of the primitive church to
adore their false gods. Active negotiations
for this object are being
carried on between five states of
the ancient diocese of Basel, the
cantons of Zurich, Schaffhausen,
Ticino, Geneva, etc. It has been
decided to have a bishop. All will
be required to submit to this bishop.
But he will have a superior in
the form of a synod composed of
sectaries of all creeds or of no
creed, and these will enjoy, in his
regard, the right of deposition. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
is asserted that M. Reinkens will
consecrate the new bishop. The
consecration of an apostate does
not share in the promise of indefectibility.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the Old Catholics will
not succeed in erecting a serious
edifice. To found a church there
are needed faith, zeal, devotedness,
religious conviction. Radicals and
free-thinkers have none of these.</p>

<p>Without belief of any kind, their
one aim is the overthrow of all religion.
Let them, then, seize our
churches&mdash;let them decree the formation
of an ecclesiastical hierarchy!
The profaned churches
will be deserted, their priests will
be despised, and again they will be
taught the lesson that the Living
God does not preside over schismatics
and heretics!</p>

<h3>ARE YOU MY WIFE?</h3>

<p class="center">BY THE AUTHOR OF “PARIS BEFORE THE WAR,” “NUMBER THIRTEEN,” “PIUS VI.,” ETC.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SEARCH RENEWED.</span></h4>

<p>Everybody was late next day at
the Court; everybody except Clide
de Winton, whose waking dreams
being brighter than any that his
pillow could suggest, had deserted
it at a comparatively early hour,
and had been for a stroll in the park
before breakfast. He re-entered
the house whistling an air from
<cite>Don Giovanni</cite>, and went into the
library, where he expected to find
Sir Simon. The baronet generally
came in there to read his letters
when there were people staying in
the house. The library was a noble
room with its six high pointed windows
set in deep mullions, and its
walls wainscoted with books on the
east and west&mdash;rich-clad volumes
of crimson and brown, with the gold
letters of their names relieving the
sombre hues like thin streaks of light,
while at intervals great old florentines
in folios “garmented in white”
made a break in the general solemnity.
The end opposite the windows
was left clear for a group of
family portraits; and beneath these,
as Clide burst into the room, there
stood a living group, conversing
together in low tones, and with
anxious, harassed faces. Mrs. de
Winton, contrary to her custom,
had on a gray cashmere dressing-gown,
whose soft, clinging drapery
gave her tall figure some resemblance
to a classical statue; she
was leaning her arm on the high
mantel-piece, with an open letter in
her hand, which she was apparently
discussing with deep annoyance,
and with a cloud of incredulity on
her handsome, cold features; the
admiral was striking the marble
with his clenched hand, and looking
steadily at the bronze clock, as if
vehemently remonstrating with it
for marking ten minutes to eleven;
Sir Simon was standing with his
hands in his pockets, his back
against the base of Cicero’s bust,
very nearly as white as the Roman
orator himself.</p>

<p>The three figures started when
Clide opened the door. He felt instantaneously
that something was
amiss, but there was a momentary
pause before he said:</p>

<p>“Has anything happened?”</p>

<p>Mrs. de Winton, seeing that no
one else spoke, came forward: “Nothing
that we are certain of; but
your uncle has received a letter
that has shocked and startled us a
good deal, although it seems on the
face of it quite impossible that the
thing can be true. But you will be
brave, Clide, and meet it as becomes
a Christian.” She spoke calmly, but
her voice trembled a little.</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake what is it?”
said Clide, a horrible thought darting
through him like a sting. Why
did his uncle keep looking away
from him? “Uncle, what is it?”</p>

<p>“It is a letter from Ralph Cromer&mdash;you
remember your uncle’s old
valet?&mdash;he is in London now; he
was at Glanworth on that dreadful
night.… My dear boy,” laying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>
her hand kindly on his arm, “it may
be a mere fancy of his; in fact, it
seems impossible for a moment to
admit of its being anything else; but
Cromer says he has seen her.…”</p>

<p>“Seen whom? My dead wife …
Isabel! The man is mad!”</p>

<p>“It must be a delusion; we are
certain it is; but still it has given
us a shock,” said his stepmother.</p>

<p>“What does the man say? Show
me his letter!”</p>

<p>She handed it to him.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Honored Master</span>: I am
hard set to believe it; but if it an’t
her, it’s her ghost as I seen this
mornin’ comin’ out of a house in
Wimpole Street, and though I ran
after her as hard as my bad leg ’ud
let me, she jumped into a cab and
was off before I could get another
look of her. It was the young
missis, Master Clide’s wife, as you
buried eight year ago, Sir, as I’m a
live man; unless I went blind of a
sudden and saw wrong, which an’t
likely, as you know to the last my
eyes was strong and far-seein’. I
went back to the house, but the man
could tell me nothin’ except as all
sorts of people keep comin’ and
goin’ with the toothache, in and out,
his employer bein’ a dentist, and
too busy to be disturbed with questions
as didn’t pay. I lose no time
in acquaintin’ you of, honored master,
and remain yours dutifully to
command,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ralph Cromer</span>.”</p>

<p>There was a dead silence in the
room while Clide read the letter.
Every one of the six eyes was fixed
on him eagerly. He crushed the
paper in his hand, and sat down
without uttering a word.</p>

<p>“Don’t let yourself be scared too
quickly, De Winton,” said Sir Simon;
“it is perfectly clear to my
mind that the thing is a mere imagination
of Cromer’s; he’s nearly
in his dotage; he sees somebody
who bears a strong likeness to a
person he knew nearly eight years
ago, and he jumps at the conclusion
that it is that person.”</p>

<p>Clide made no answer to this,
but turned round and faced his uncle,
who still stood with his hand
clenched stolidly on the mantel-piece.</p>

<p>“Uncle, what do you think of
it?” he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>The admiral walked deliberately
towards the sofa and sat down beside
his nephew. Before he spoke
he held out his horny palm, and
grasped Clide’s hand tightly. The
action was too significant not to
convey to Clide all it was meant&mdash;perhaps
unconsciously&mdash;to express.</p>

<p>The admiral did not believe the
story to be the phantom of dotage;
he believed Cromer had seen Isabel.</p>

<p>“My boy,” he said, speaking in a
harsh, abrupt tone, as if the words
were being dragged out of him, “I
can say nothing until we have investigated
the matter. An hour
ago I would have sworn it was
absurd, impossible. I would have
said, with an oath, it cannot be
true. I saw her laid in her coffin
and buried at St. Valéry. But I
might have sworn falsely. Several
days had elapsed between the death
and the burial; the features were
swollen, scarcely recognizable. I
took it perhaps too readily for
granted that they were hers; I
ought to have looked closer and
longer; but I shrank from looking
at all; I only glanced; they showed
me the hair; it was the same
length and apparently the same
color, deep jet black; the height too
corresponded. This, as well as all
the collateral evidence, satisfied me
at once as to the identity. It may
be that I was too rash, too anxious
to be convinced.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span></p>

<p>Clide was silent for a few moments.
Then he said:</p>

<p>“Where did the dentist live that
gave us the clew before?”</p>

<p>“In Wimpole Street.”</p>

<p>Clide drew away his hand quickly
from his uncle’s with a visible
shudder. The coincidence had
done its work with the others before
he came in. An inarticulate
exclamation, full of passionate emotion
of some sort, broke from him.</p>

<p>“Come, come,” said Sir Simon,
striding towards the window, “it’s
sheer nonsense to take for granted
that the house is burnt down because
there’s a smell of fire. The
coincidences are strange, very singular
certainly; but such things
happen every day. I stick to my
first impression that it’s nothing but
a delusion of Cromer’s in the first
instance, to which the chance similarity
of the dentist’s address gives
a color of reality too faint to be
worth more than it actually is.
You must go up to town at once,
and clear away the mistake; it’s
too monstrous to be anything else.”</p>

<p>He spoke in a very determined
manner, as if he were too thoroughly
convinced himself to doubt of
convincing others. Clide made a
resolute effort to be convinced.</p>

<p>“Yes, you say truly; it’s unreasonable
to accept the story without
further evidence. I will go in
search of it without an hour’s delay.
Uncle, you will come with
me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my boy, yes; we will go
together; we must start in about
an hour from this”&mdash;pulling out
his watch&mdash;“meantime, come in and
have your breakfast; it wont help
matters to travel on an empty
stomach.”</p>

<p>Mrs. de Vinton left the room hurriedly;
the others were following;
but Clide had weightier things on
his mind than breakfast; he closed
the door after his uncle and turned
round, facing Sir Simon.</p>

<p>The latter was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“Has anything definite passed
between you and Franceline?”</p>

<p>It was precisely to speak about
this that he had detained Sir Simon,
yet when the baronet broached
the subject in this frank, straight-to-the-point
way, he answered him
almost savagely: “What’s the use
of reminding me of her now! As
if the thought were not already
driving me mad!”</p>

<p>“I must speak of it. Whatever
misery may be in store for the rest
of us, I am responsible for her share
in it. I insist upon knowing how
far things have gone between you.
Have you distinctly committed
yourself?”</p>

<p>“If following a woman like her
shadow, and hanging on every
word she says, and telling her by
every look and tone that he worships
the ground she walks on&mdash;if
you call that distinctly committing
myself, I shouldn’t think you needed
to ask.”</p>

<p>“Have you asked her to be your
wife?”</p>

<p>“Not in so many words.”</p>

<p>“Does she care for you? De
Winton, be honest with me. This
is no time for squeamishness.
Speak out to me as man to man. I
feel towards this young girl as if
she were my own child. I have
known all along how it was with
you. But how about her? Have I
guessed right&mdash;does she love you?”</p>

<p>“God help me! God help us
both!” And with this passionate
cry Clide turned away and, hiding
his face in his hands, let himself
fall into a chair.</p>

<p>“God help you, my poor lad!
And God forgive me!” muttered
Sir Simon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span></p>

<p>The accent of self-reproach in
which the prayer was uttered smote
Clide to the heart; it stirred all
that was noble and unselfish within
him, and in the midst of his overwhelming
anguish bade him forget
himself to comfort his friend.</p>

<p>“You have nothing to reproach
yourself with; you acted like a
true friend, like a father to me.
You meant to make me the happiest
of men, to give me a treasure that
I never could be worthy of. God
bless you for it!” He held out his
hand, and grasped Sir Simon’s.
“No, nobody is to blame; it is
my own destiny that pursues me.
I thought I had lived it down; but
I was mistaken. I am never to
live it down. I could bear it if it
fell upon myself alone. I had
grown used to it. But that it
should fall upon her! What has
she done to deserve it?… What
do I not deserve for bringing this
curse upon her?” He rose up with
flashing eye, his whole frame quivering
with passion&mdash;he struck out
against the air with both arms, as
if striving to burst some invisible,
unendurable bond.</p>

<p>Sir Simon started back affrighted.
Kind-hearted, easy-going Sir
Simon had never experienced the
overmastering force of passion,
whether of anger or grief, love or
joy; his was one of those natures
that when the storm comes lie
down and let it sweep over them.
He was brought now for the first
time in his life in contact with the
spectacle of one who did not bend
under the tempest, but rose up in
frantic defiance, breasting and resisting
it. He quailed before the
sight; he could not make a sign
or find a word to say. But the
transient paroxysm of madness
spent itself, and after a few minutes
Clide said, hopelessly yet fiercely:</p>

<p>“Speak to me, why don’t you,
Harness?” Emotion swept away
his habitual tone of respect towards
the man who might have been his
father. “Help me to help her!
What can I do to stand between
her and this misery? I must see
her before I go, and what in Heaven’s
name shall I say to her?”</p>

<p>“You shall not see her,” said
Sir Simon; “you would not think
of such a thing if you were in
your right mind; but you are mad,
De Winton. Say to her, indeed!
That you find you are a married
man&mdash;I don’t believe it, mind&mdash;but
what else could you say if you
were to see her? While there is
the shadow of a doubt on this
head you must not see her, must
not directly or indirectly hold any
communication with her.”</p>

<p>“And I am to sneak off without
a word of explanation, and leave
her to think of me as a heartless,
dishonorable scoundrel!”</p>

<p>“A bitter alternative; but it is
better to seem a scoundrel than
to be one,” answered Sir Simon.
“What could you say to her if you
saw her?”</p>

<p>“I would tell her the truth and
ask her to forgive me,” said the
young man, his face kindling with
tenderness and passion of a softer
kind than that which had just convulsed
its fine lineaments. “I
would bless her for what the memory
of her love must be to me
while I live. Harness, if it is only
to say ‘God bless you and forgive
me!’ I must see her.”</p>

<p>“I’ll shoot you first!” said the
baronet, clutching his arm and
arresting his steps toward the
door. “You call that love? I
call it the basest selfishness. You
would see the woman who loves
you for the sole purpose of planting
yourself so firmly in the ruins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
of her broken heart that nothing
could ever uproot it; but then she
would worship you as a victim&mdash;a
victim of her own making, and this
would be compensation to you for
a great deal. I thought better of
you, De Winton, than to suppose
you capable of such heartless foppery.”</p>

<p>It was Clide’s turn to quail. But
he answered quickly:</p>

<p>“You are right. It would be
selfish and cruel. I was mad to
think of it.”</p>

<p>“Of course you were. I knew
you would see it in a moment.”</p>

<p>“But there is no reason why I
should not see her father,” said
Clide; “it is only fit that I should
speak to him. Shall I go there, or
will you bring him up here?”</p>

<p>“You shall not see him, here or
anywhere else,” was the peremptory
reply. “Have you spoken to him
already?”</p>

<p>“No. I went down this morning
for the purpose, but he was not up.”</p>

<p>“That was providential. And
about Franceline, am I to understand
there is a distinct engagement
between you?”</p>

<p>“As distinct as need be for a
man of honor.”</p>

<p>“Since when?”</p>

<p>“Last night.”</p>

<p>Sir Simon winced. This at any
rate was his doing. He had taken
every pains to precipitate what now
he would have given almost anything
he possessed to undo.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what it is, you must
leave the matter in my hands. I
will see the count as soon as you
are gone. I will tell him that your
uncle has been called off suddenly
on important business that required
your presence, and that you have
gone with him. For the present it
is not necessary to say more; it
would be cruel to do so.”</p>

<p>“I will abide by your advice,”
said Clide submissively; “but
afterwards&mdash;what if this terrible news
turns out to be true?”</p>

<p>“It has yet to be proved.”</p>

<p>“If it is proved it will kill her!”
exclaimed Clide, speaking rather to
himself than to his companion.</p>

<p>“Pooh! nonsense! All fancy
that. Lovers’ dead are easily buried,”
said Sir Simon, affecting a
cheerfulness he was very far from
feeling. He knew better than Clide
how ill-fitted Franceline was, both
by the sensitive delicacy of her own
nature and the inherited delicacy
of a consumptive mother, to bear
up against such a blow as that
which threatened her; but he
would not lacerate the poor fellow’s
heart by letting him share these
gloomy forebodings that were based
on surer ground than the sentimental
fears of a lover. Perhaps the
expression of his undisciplined features&mdash;the
brow that could frown
but knew not how to dissemble; the
lip that could smile so kindly, or
curl in contempt, but knew not how
to lie; the eye that was the faithful,
even when the unconscious, interpreter
of the mind&mdash;may have
said more to Clide than was intended.</p>

<p>“I trust you to watch over her,”
he said; and then added in a tone
that went to Sir Simon’s very heart,
“don’t spare me if it can help you
to spare her. Tell her I am a
blackguard&mdash;it’s true by comparison;
compared to her snow-white
purity and angelic innocence of
heart, I am no better than a false
and selfish brute. Blacken me as
much as you like&mdash;make her hate
me&mdash;anything rather than that she
should suffer, or guess what I am
suffering. God knows I would
bear it and ten times worse to shield
her from one pang!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is spoken like yourself,”
said the baronet. “I recognize
your father’s son now.”</p>

<p>They grasped each other’s hands
in silence. Clide was opening the
door when suddenly he turned
round and said with a smile of
touching pathos:</p>

<p>“You will not begin the blackening
process at once? You will
wait till we know if it is necessary?”</p>

<p>“All right&mdash;you may trust me,”
was the rejoinder, and they went
together into the breakfast-room.</p>

<p class="break">They had the carriage to themselves.
Clide was glad of it. It
was a strange fatality that drew
these two men, alike only in name,
so closely together in the most trying
crises of the younger man’s life.
He spoke of it gratefully, but bitterly.</p>

<p>“Yes, your support is the one
drop of comfort granted me in this
trouble, as it was in the other,” he
said, as the train carried them
through the green fields and past
many a spot made dear and beautiful
by memory; “it is abominably
selfish of me to use it as I do, but
where should I be without it! I
should have been in a mad-house
before this if it were not for you,
uncle, hunted as I am like a mad-dog.
What have I done so much
worse than other men to be cursed
like this!”</p>

<p>The admiral had hitherto been
as gentle towards his nephew as a
fond but awkward nurse handling
a sick child; but he turned on him
now with a severe countenance.</p>

<p>“What right have you to turn
round on your Maker and upbraid
him for the consequences of your
own folly? You talk of being
cursed; we make our own curses.
We commit follies and sins, and
we have to pay for it, and then we
call it destiny! It is your own
misdoing that is hunting you.
You thought to make life into a
holiday; to shirk every duty,
everything that was the least irksome
or distasteful; you flew in the
face of common-sense, and family
dignity, and all the responsibilities
of life in your marriage; you rushed
into the most solemn act of a
man’s life with about as much decency
and reverence as a masquerader
at a fancy ball. Instead of
acting openly in the matter and
taking counsel with your relatives,
you fall in love with a pretty face
and marry it without even as much
prudence as a man exercises in
hiring a groom. You pay the penalty
of this, and then, forsooth, you
turn round on Providence and
complain of being cursed! I don’t
want to be hard on you, and I’m
not fond of playing Job’s comforter;
but I can’t sit here and listen
to you blaspheming without protesting
against it.”</p>

<p>When the admiral had finished
this harangue, the longest he ever
made in his life, he took out his
snuff-box and gave it a sharp tap
preparatory to taking a pinch.</p>

<p>“You are quite right, sir; you
are perfectly right,” said Clide; “I
have no one to blame but myself
for that misfortune.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you see it and own it
like a man that’s a great point,”
said the admiral, mollified at once.
“The first step towards getting on
the right tack is to see that we
have been going on the wrong
one.”</p>

<p>“I was very young too,” pleaded
Clide; “barely of age. That ought
to count for something in my favor.”</p>

<p>“So it does; of course it does, my
boy,” assented his uncle warmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span></p>

<p>“I came to see the folly and the
sinfulness of it all&mdash;of shirking my
duties, as you say&mdash;and I was resolved
to turn over a new leaf and
make up for what I had left undone
too long. M. de la Bourbonais
said to me, ‘We most of us are
asleep until the sting of sorrow
wakes us up.’ It had taken a long
time to do it, but it did wake me
up at last; and just as I was thoroughly
stung into activity, into a
desire to be of use to somebody,
to make my life what it ought to
be, there comes down this thunderclap
upon me, and dashes it all to
pieces again. That is what I complain
of. That is what is hard.
This has been no doing of mine.”</p>

<p>“Whose doing is it? It is the
old mistake sticking to you still.
It is the day of reckoning that
comes sooner or later after every
man’s guilt or folly. We bury it
out of sight, but it rises up like a
day of judgment on us when we
least expect it.”</p>

<p>“I was not kept long waiting for
the day of reckoning to my first
folly&mdash;call it sin, if you like&mdash;” said
Clide bitterly. “I should have
thought it was expiated by this.
Eight of the best years of my life
wasted in wretchedness.”</p>

<p>“You wasted them because you
liked it; because it was pleasanter
to you to go mooning about the
world than to come back to your
post at home, and do your duty to
God and yourself and your fellow-men,”
retorted the admiral gruffly.
“If we swallow poison, are its
gripings to be reckoned merit to
us? You spent eight years eating
the fruit of your own act, and you
expect the bitterness to count as
an atonement. My boy, I have no
right to preach to you, or to any
one; I have too many holes in my
own coat; but I have this advantage
over you&mdash;that I see where the
holes are and what made them.
We need never expect things to go
right with us unless we do the right
thing; and if we do right and
things seem to go wrong, they are
sure to be right all the same,
though we can’t see it. It is not all
over here; the real reckoning is on
the other side. But we have not
come to that yet,” he added, in an
encouraging tone; “this threat
may turn out to be a vain one,
and if so you will be none the
worse for it&mdash;probably all the better.
We want to be reminded
every now and then that we don’t
command either waves or wind;
that when we are brought through
smooth seas safe into port, a Hand
mightier than ours has been guiding
the helm for us. We are not
quite such independent, fine fellows
as we like to think. But come
what may, fine weather or foul,
you will meet it like a Christian,
you will bow your head and submit.”</p>

<p>The admiral tapped his snuff-box
again at this climax, took another
pinch, and then fell back on
the cushions and opened his paper.</p>

<p>Clide was glad to be left to himself,
although his thoughts were not
cheerful.</p>

<p>Sir Simon had said truly, he was
or ought to have been a Catholic.
At almost the very outset of his
acquaintance with Franceline, he
had intimated this fact to her, and
though she did not inform her father
of it, the knowledge undoubtedly
went far in attracting her towards
the young man and inspiring
the confidence that she yielded
to him so quickly and unquestioningly.</p>

<p>Mrs. de Winton, Clide’s mother,
had been a sincere Catholic, although
her heart had beguiled her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span>
into the treacherous error of marrying
a man who was not of her faith.
She had stipulated unconditionally
that her children should be brought
up Catholics; and on her death-bed
demanded a renewal of the
promise&mdash;then, as formerly, freely
given&mdash;that Clide, their only child,
should be carefully educated in his
mother’s religion. But these things
can never safely be entrusted to
the good-will of any human being.
The mother compromised&mdash;if she
did not betray&mdash;her solemn trust,
and her child paid the penalty.
Mr. de Winton kept his promise as
far as he could. He had no prejudices
against the old religion&mdash;he
was too indifferent to religion in
the main for that&mdash;the antiquity
and noble traditions of the Catholic
Church claimed his intellectual
sympathies, while its spirit and teaching,
as exemplified in the life of her
whom he revered as the model of
all the virtues, inclined him to look
on the doctrines of Catholicity with
an indulgence leaning to reverence,
even where he felt them most antagonistic.</p>

<p>Clide had a Catholic nurse to
wash and scold him in his infantine
days, and when, too soon after his
father’s second marriage, the boy
became an orphan and was left to
the care of a stepmother, that cold
but conscientious lady carried out
her husband’s dying injunctions by
engaging a Catholic governess to
teach him his letters. Conscience,
however, gave other promptings
which Mrs. de Winton found it hard
to reconcile with the faithful discharge
of her late husband’s wishes.
She maintained the Catholic influence
at home, but she would not
prolong the evil day an hour more
than was absolutely necessary. She
felt justified, therefore, in precipitating
Clide’s entrance at Eton at an
age when many children were still
in the nursery. The Catholic catechism
was not on the list of Etonian
school-books, and he would be
otherwise safe from the corroding
influence which as yet could scarcely
have penetrated below the surface
of his mind. It was reasonably to
be hoped that in course of time the
false tenets he had imbibed would
fade out of his mind altogether, and
that when he was of an age to
choose for himself the boy would
elect the more respectable and rational
creed of the De Wintons.
His stepmother carried her conscientious
scruples so far in this respect,
however, as to inform the
dame who was charged with the
care of Clide’s linen, and the tutor
who was to train his mind, that the
boy was a Catholic and that his religion
was to be respected. This
injunction was, after a certain fashion,
strictly obeyed. The subject
of religion was carefully avoided,
never mentioned to Clide directly
or indirectly; and he was left to
grow up with about as much spiritual
culture as the laborer bestows
on the flowers of the field. The
seeds sown by his mother’s hand
were quickly carried away by the
winds that blow from the four
points of the compass in those
early, youthful days. If some
sunk deeper and remained, they
had not sun or dew enough to blossom
forth and fructify. Perhaps,
nevertheless, they did their work,
and acted as an antidote in the
virgin, untilled soil, and preserved
the young infidel from the vicious
vapors that tainted the air around
him. It is certain that Clide left
the immoral atmosphere of the
great public school quite uncorrupted,
guileless and upright, and
still calling himself a Catholic, although
he had practically broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
off from all communion with the
church of his childhood. He was
more to be pitied than blamed.
He was thinking so now as he lay
back in the railway carriage, while
the admiral sat beside him grunting
complacently over the leading
article, and mentally prognosticating
that the country was going to
the dogs, thanks to those blundering,
unpatriotic Whigs. Yes, Clide
pitied himself as he surveyed the
past, and saw how his young life
had been wasted and shipwrecked.
If he felt that he had been too severely
punished for follies that he
had never been warned against,
you must make allowance for him.
His face wore a very sad, subdued
look as he gazed out vacantly at
the quiet fields and villages and
steeples flying past. Why does he
suddenly make that almost imperceptible
movement, starting as if a
voice had sounded close to his
side? Was it fancy, or did he
really hear a voice, low and soft,
like faint, distant music that stirred
his soul, making it vibrate to some
dimly remembered melody? Could
it be his mother’s voice echoing
through the far-off years when he
was a little child and knelt with his
small hands clasped upon her knee,
and lisped out some forgotten
words that she dictated? Was it a
trick of his imagination, or did
some one stand at his side, gently
touching his right hand and
constraining him to lift it to his
forehead, while his tongue mechanically
accompanied the movement
with some once familiar,
long disused formula? There
was in truth a presence near him,
and a voice sounding from afar,
murmuring those notes of memory
which are the mother-tongue of the
soul, subtle, persuasive, irresistible;
accents that live when we have forgotten
languages acquired with mature
choice and arduous study; a
presence that clings to us through
life, and reveals itself when we have
the will and the gift to see and to
recognize it. That power is mostly
the purchase of a great pain; the
answer to our soul’s cry in the hour
of its deepest need.</p>

<p>It flashed suddenly upon Clide,
as that sweet and solemn influence
pervaded and uplifted him, that
here lay the unexpected solution
of the problem&mdash;the missing key of
life. He had fancied for a moment
that he had found it in M. de la
Bourbonais’ serene theories and practical
philosophy. These had done
much for him, it is true; but they
had fallen away; they failed like a
broken sword in the hour of trial;
they did well enough for peaceful
times, but they could not help and
rescue him when all the forces of
the enemy were let loose. Yet they
seemed to have sufficed for Raymond.</p>

<p>Clide did not know that the calm
philosophy was grafted on a root
of faith in the French gentleman’s
mind; his faith was not dead; far
from it, and its vital heat had fed
the strength which philosophy alone
could never have supplied. Poor
Clide! If any one had been at
hand to interpret to him the message
of that voice from his childhood,
the whole aspect of life might
there and then have changed for
him. But no spiritual guide, no
gentle monitor was there to tell him
what it meant. The music died
away; the presence was clouded
over and ceased to be felt. When
the train entered the station the
passing emotion had disappeared,
drowned without by the roar of the
great city; within, by the agitation
of the present which other thoughts
had for a moment lulled to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span></p>

<p>The travellers drove straight from
the railway station to Wimpole
Street. Mr. Peckett, the dentist,
was at home. They were admitted
at once, and a few minutes’ conversation
sufficed to confirm their
worst forebodings. There could be
no doubt but that the person whom
Cromer had recognized in that transitory
glimpse the day before was
the beautiful and mysterious creature,
Clide’s wife.</p>

<p>The dentist had very little definite
information to give concerning
her. He could only certify that
she was the same who had come to
him nearly ten years ago to have a
silver tooth made. It was a fantastic
idea of her own, and in spite of
all his remonstrances she insisted
on having it carried out; it had
seriously injured the neighboring
tooth&mdash;nearly eaten it away. This
was what Mr. Peckett had foretold.
He was launching out into a rather
excited denunciation of the thing,
an absurdity against all the laws of
dentistry, when the admiral called
him back to the point. Did this
tooth still exist? Yes; and if it
was of no other use, it would serve
to identify the wearer. She had
been to have it arranged about four
years ago, and again within the last
few days. Mr. Peckett said she
was very little changed in appearance;
as beautiful as ever, and considerably
developed in figure; but
in manner she was greatly altered.
Her former childlike gayety was
quite gone; she sat demure and
silent, and when she spoke it was
with a sort of frightened restraint;
if a door opened, or if he asked a
question abruptly, she started as if
in terror. It was not the ordinary
starting of a nervous person; there
was something in the expression of
the face, in the quivering of the
mouth and the wavering glance of
the eyes, that had on one occasion
especially suggested to him the idea
of a person whose mental faculties
had suffered some derangement.
She gave him the impression, in fact,
of one who either had been or
might on slight provocation become
mad. She never gave any name or
address, but had always been accompanied
by either the man whom
she called “uncle,” or an elderly
woman with the manner of a well-to-do
shopkeeper; and she seemed
in great awe of both of them. Yesterday
was the first time she had
ever come by herself, and Mr. Peckett
thought that very likely either
of these persons was waiting for
her in the cab into which she had
jumped so quickly when Cromer
was trying to come up with her.
She had left no clew as to her residence
or projected movements; only
once, in reply to some question
about a recipe which her uncle
wanted the dentist to see, she said
that it had been forgotten in St.
Petersburg. His answer seemed to
imply that they meant to return
there. Mr. Peckett was quite sure
she sang in public, but whether on
the stage or only in concerts he
could not say.</p>

<p>This was all he had to tell about
his mysterious patient. He was
very frank, and appeared anxious
to give any assistance in his power,
and promised to let Admiral de
Winton know if she came to him
again. But he thought this was not
likely for some time, at any rate.
He had finished with her on the
last visit, and there was no reason
that he foresaw for her coming
back at present.</p>

<p>There was not a shadow of
doubt on Clide’s mind but that the
person in question was his lost Isabel.
The admiral, however, stoutly
continued to pooh-pooh the idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
as absurd and impossible. He was
determined, at any rate, not to give
in to it until he had been to St.
Valéry, and investigated the question
of the dead Isabel whom he
had seen buried there. So he left
Clide to open communications once
more with Scotland Yard, and set
the police in motion amongst the
managers of theatres and other
agents of the musical world, while
he went on board the steamer to
Dieppe. He was not long searching
for the link he dreaded to find.
The young woman whom he had so
hastily concluded to be his nephew’s
missing wife had been proved to
be the daughter of a Spanish merchant,
whose ship had foundered
on the Normandy coast in the gales
that had done so much damage
during that eventful week. He
himself had been saved almost
miraculously, and after many weeks
of agonized suspense as to the fate
of his child, he heard of a body
having been washed ashore at St.
Valéry, and buried after waiting
several days for recognition. He
hastened to the spot, and, in spite
of the swift ravages of death, recognized
it beyond a doubt as that of
his child. The English milord who
had paid for all the expenses of the
little grave, and manifested such
emotion on beholding the body,
turning away without another
glance when he saw the long hair
sweeping over it like a veil, had left
no address, so the authorities had
no means of communicating with
him.</p>

<p>This was the intelligence which
Clide received two days after his
interview with the dentist. It only
confirmed his previous conviction.
He was as satisfied that his wife was
alive as if he had seen and spoken
to her. About an hour after his
uncle’s return there came a note
from Mr. Peckett saying that “the
person in question” was on her way
to Berlin, if she had not already
arrived there. The landlady of the
house where she had been lodging,
under the name of Mme. Villar,
had called at Wimpole Street for a
pocket-book which her late tenant
believed she must have dropped
there. While she was inquiring
about it of the servant, Mr. Peckett
came out; he inquired after his
patient; the landlady was glad to
say she was well, and sorry to say
she was gone; she had left the day
before for Berlin, going <i lang="la">via</i> Paris.</p>

<p>“Now, uncle, we must part,”
said Clide; “I can’t drag you about
on this miserable business any
more. I must do what remains to
be done myself. I will start at
once for Berlin, and once there, à
la grace de Dieu! you will hear
from me when I have anything to
say.”</p>

<p>“I shall hear from you as soon
as you arrive; you must write to
me without waiting for news,” said
the admiral. “You will take Stanton
with you?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I had better; he
knows everything, so there is no
need to shirk him, and he’s a discreet
fellow, as well as intelligent
and good-natured. He may be of
use to me.”</p>

<p>“Then God be with you both,
my boy. Bear up, and keep a
stout heart whatever comes,” said
the admiral, wringing his hand.</p>

<p>“You will write to Harness for
me,” said Clide; “tell him I can’t
write myself; and say I trust to his
doing whatever is best for me.…”</p>

<p>He turned away abruptly; and so
they parted.</p>

<p>No incident broke the monotony
of the road until Clide reached
Cologne. There, as he was crossing
the platform, a lady passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
him; she looked at him, and started,
or he fancied she did, and instead
of getting into the carriage
that they were both evidently making
for, she hurried on to the one
higher up. He drew his hand
across his forehead, and stood for a
moment trying to remember where
he had seen the face, but his memory
failed him. His curiosity was
roused, however, and he was in
that frame of mind when every insignificant
trifle comes to us pregnant
with unlooked-for possibilities.
He went on to the carriage
the lady had entered. There was
only another occupant beside herself,
an elderly German, with a
beery countenance and brick-red
whiskers. Clide got in and seated
himself opposite the lady, who was
at the other end of the compartment,
and steadily looking out of
the window. He felt sure she had
seen him come up to the door, but
she did not turn round when he
opened it and closed it again with
a bang. They had five minutes to
wait before the train started. Clide
employed them in getting out a
book and making himself comfortable
for the long ride in prospect.
The lady was still absorbed in the
landscape. The German made his
preparations by taking a clay pipe
from his pocket, filling it as full
as it would hold with tobacco,
and then striking a light. Clide had
started bolt upright, and was watching
in amazement. The lady was
in front of him. Did the brute
mean to puff his disgusting weed
into her face? He was making a
chimney of his hand to let the
match light thoroughly. Perhaps
Clide’s vehement look of indignation
touched him mesmerically, for
before applying it to the pipe he
looked round at him and said in
very intelligible English:</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t object to
smoking?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say I much relish tobacco,
but I sha’n’t interfere with
you if this lady does not object.”</p>

<p>Mein herr asked her if she did.
She was compelled to turn round
at the question.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say I do, sir; the
smell of tobacco makes me quite
sick.”</p>

<p>Hem! She is not a lady, at any
rate, thought Clide.</p>

<p>“Oh! I am sorry for that,” said
the German; “for you’ll have the
trouble of getting out.”</p>

<p>Before Clide could recover sufficient
presence of mind to collar
the man and pitch him headforemost
out of the window, the lady
had grasped her bag, rug, and umbrella,
and was standing on the
platform. The impending ejectment
was clearly a most welcome
release; nothing but the utmost
goodwill could have enabled her
to effect such a rapid exit. Clide
was so struck by it that he forgot
to collar the German, who had begun
with equal alacrity to puff
away at his pipe, and the train
moved on.</p>

<p>The first thing Clide saw on
alighting at the next station was
his recent <i lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i> marshalling an
array of luggage that struck even
his inexperienced eye as somewhat
out of keeping with a person who
said “sir” and travelled without a
servant. What could one lone woman
want with such a lot of boxes,
and such big ones? She waylaid a
porter, who proceeded to pile them
on a truck while she stood mounting
guard over them.</p>

<p>“Follow that man and see where
he is taking that luggage to,” Clide
whispered to Stanton, and the
latter, leaving his master to look
after their respective portmanteaux,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span>
hurried on in the direction
indicated.</p>

<p>“They are going to the Hotel of
the Great Frederick, sir,” he said,
returning in a few minutes.</p>

<p>“Then call a cab and let us drive
there.”</p>

<p>The Hotel of the Great Frederick
was not one of the fashionable
caravansaries of the place; it was a
large, old-fashioned kind of hostelry,
chiefly frequented by business
people, travelling clerks, dress-makers,
etc.; and its customers were
numerous enough to make it often
difficult to secure accommodation
there on short notice. This was a
busy season; everybody was flitting
to and from the watering-places,
where the invalids and
gamblers of Europe were ruining
or repairing their fortunes and
their constitutions, so that Mr. de
Winton was obliged to content
himself with two small rooms in
the third story for the night; to-morrow
many travellers would be
moving on, and he could have more
convenient quarters.</p>

<p>“Stanton, keep a lookout after
that person. I am in a mood for
suspecting everything and everybody;
but I don’t think it’s all
fancy in this case. I believe the
woman is trying to avoid me; and
if so, she must have a motive for it.
Ask for the visitors’ book, and
bring it to me at once.”</p>

<p>Stanton brought the book, and
while his master was running his
eye searchingly over the roll of
names, hoping and dreading to see
Mme. Villar among the number, he
set off to look after the woman
with the multitude of boxes. She
was lodging on the first floor, and
had been expected by a lady and
gentleman who had taken rooms in
the house the day before. This
much Stanton learned from a
<i lang="de">Kellner</i>,<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> whom he met coming out of
the said rooms with a tray in his
hands.</p>

<p>“I think I know her,” said Stanton.
“What is her name?”</p>

<p>But before the <i lang="de">Kellner</i> could answer
the door opened, and the lady
herself stood face to face with Mr.
de Winton’s valet. Their eyes met
with a sudden flash of recognition;
Stanton turned away with an almost
inaudible whistle, and was vaulting
up to the third story in the twinkling
of an eye.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen her, sir, and I can tell
you who she is. She is the dressmaker
that made Mrs. de Winton’s
gowns before you brought her to
Glanworth. I remembered her the
moment I saw her without a bonnet.
I had been twice to her place in
Brook Street, with messages and a
band-box from Mrs. de Winton.”</p>

<p>Clide had started up with an exclamation
of anger and triumph.
Here, then, was a clew. Evidently
the woman held communication or
was in some way connected with
Isabel, else why should she have
shrunk from meeting him? It was
clear as daylight now that she did
shrink.</p>

<p>“Tell the landlord I wish to
speak to him,” said Clide.</p>

<p>He was walking up and down the
room, his hands in his pockets, and
his head tossed back like an impatient
horse, when the owner of the
Great Frederick came in.</p>

<p>“I want to have a word of conversation
with you; sit down, pray,”
said Clide; but he continued walking,
as we are apt to do when agitation
is too vehement to bear immobility,
and must have an outlet
in motion. The landlord had taken
a chair as desired, but rose again
on seeing that his guest did not sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
down; the hotel-keeper was a well-mannered
man. There was a lapse
of two or three moments while Clide
considered what he should say. It
was impossible to acknowledge the
real motive of his curiosity about
the occupants of the first-floor
rooms, and how otherwise could he
justify any inquiries about them
and their movements? He recoiled
from the odious necessity that
drove him to pry into people’s affairs,
to ask questions and set watches
like a police agent; but this was
the mere husk of the bitter kernel
he had to eat. It may have been
the extraordinary agitation visible
in the young man’s face and gait
and manner that aroused the hotel-keeper’s
suspicions and put him on
the defensive, or it may have been
that some one had been beforehand
with Clide, and cut the ground from
under his feet by warning the landlord
not to give any information;
but at any rate the latter acted with
a circumspection that was remarkable
in a person so unskilled in the
science of diplomacy. These first-floor
people were good customers;
this was the third time they had
stopped at the Great Frederick,
and it was not likely to be the last,
unless, indeed, the house should be
made objectionable to them in some
way; and no landlord who knew
his duty to his customers could be
a party to such a proceeding.</p>

<p>“Mme. Brack is a most excellent
customer, but no dressmaker&mdash;that
I can assure milord of; she has
many boxes because she goes to
spend many months at Vienna;
that is her custom, as also that of
the friends she travels with&mdash;M.
Roncemar and his daughter, people
of quality like milord, and large
fortune. Unfortunately they do not
tarry long at the Great Frederick,
only remaining three days to rest
themselves; their rooms are already
bespoke from Friday morning,
when they start by the midday
train. But why should not
milord go himself and ask of M.
Roncemar any information he desires?
M. Roncemar is a most
polite gentleman, and would no
doubt be happy to see a compatriot.”</p>

<p>This was all that Clide could extract
from the wily master of the
Great Frederick. If he had been
more outspoken, he might have
been more successful; but he could
not bring himself to this; he spoke so
vaguely that his motives might have
borne the most opposite constructions.
The landlord’s private opinion
was that there was a money-claim
in the way, and that he was
on the track of some fugitive, perhaps
fraudulent, debtor; it was no
part of a landlord’s business to pry
into matters of this sort, or bring a
customer into trouble.</p>

<p>“Well, sir?” said Stanton, coming
in when he saw the landlord
come out.</p>

<p>“I did not make much out of
him; the fellow either knows more
than he cares to tell, or we are on
the wrong scent. You must lose
no time in finding out from the
waiters whether these names are the
real ones; whether, at least, they are
the same the people have borne here
before, and also if it is true that the
rooms are taken till Friday next;
if so, it gives me time to go to the
consul and take proper legal steps
for their arrest. But it may be a
dodge of his; if the woman recognized
us both, as I am strongly inclined
to believe, they have put the
landlord up to telling me this, just
to prevent my entrapping them,
and so as to give them time to escape.
The people whom he calls
Roncemar have been here at any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span>
rate before the alarm came, and it
will be known most likely whether
they are on their way to Vienna or
not. Be cautious, Stanton; don’t
rouse suspicion by asking too pointed
questions, because you see it
may be that as yet there is no suspicion,
it may be my fancy about
the man’s throwing me off the scent.
He urged me to go and see M.
Roncemar myself, which was either
a proof that he suspects nothing,
or that he is the cleverest knave
who ever outwitted another. Be
off and see what you can learn. I
will dine at the <i lang="fr">table d’hôte</i>.”</p>

<p>The few details that Stanton
gleaned from the <i lang="de">kellner</i> attached
to the first floor corroborated all
that the landlord had said: the
party were to remain until Friday&mdash;in
fact they were not quite decided
about going so soon; the younger
lady was in delicate health, and
greatly fatigued by the journey; it
was possible they might remain until
the Monday. “So if you are
counting on the rooms you may be
disappointed,” he added, winking
at Stanton as he whipped up a tray
and darted up the stairs like a monkey,
three steps at a time.</p>

<p>So far, then, Clide was sure of his
course. He walked about after
dinner&mdash;supper, as it was called
there&mdash;and called at the consulate;
but the consul had been
out of town for the last week, and
was not expected home until the
next day.</p>

<p>“And he is sure to be here to-morrow?”
inquired the visitor.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; he has an appointment
of great importance at one
o’clock. We expect him home at
twelve.”</p>

<p>“Then I will call at two. You will
not neglect to give him this card?”
He wrote a line in pencil on it announcing
his visit at two next day,
and returned to the hotel. As he
was crossing the hall he heard the
heavy tramp of hobnailed shoes
on the stairs, and a noise as of
men toiling under a weight. It
was a piano. Clide walked slowly
up after the carriers, saw them halt
at the rooms on the first floor, saw
the doors thrown open and the instrument
carried in; there was no
mistake about it; the occupants
meant to remain there for some
few days at least.</p>

<p>He sat down and wrote a long
letter to the admiral, lit a cigar,
and killed time as best he could
with the newspapers until, physically
worn out, he lay down in
hopes of catching a few hours’
sleep. Stanton, satisfied with the
information he already possessed,
felt it might be unwise to ask further
questions, and contented himself
with hanging about the corridors
in the neighborhood of Mrs.
Brack’s rooms, in hopes of seeing
her coming in or out, and catching
a glimpse, perhaps, of another inmate
who interested him more closely.
It may seem irrational in him, and
especially in his master, to have
jumped at a positive conclusion as to
the identity of that inmate on such
a flimsy tissue of evidence; but
when our minds are entirely possessed
by an idea, we magnify trifles
into important facts, and see all
things colored by the medium of
our prepossessions, and go on hooking
link after link in the chain of
witnesses till we have completed it,
and made our internal evidence do
the work of substantial testimony.</p>

<p>It was a glorious day, and when
Clide had breakfasted he was glad
to go out and reconnoitre the town
instead of sitting in his dingy
room, or lounging about the reading-room.
He was a trained walker,
thanks to his years of travel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span>
and once set going he would go
on for hours, oblivious of time, and
quite unconscious of fatigue as
long as the landscape offered him
beauty or novelty enough to interest
him. It was about half-past
ten when he left the house, and
he tramped on far beyond the town,
and walked for nearly two hours,
when the chimes of a village Angelus
bell reminded him that time
was marching too, and that he had
better be retracing his steps. It
was close upon two o’clock when
he appeared at the consul’s door.
On entering the hall, the first person
he saw was Stanton.</p>

<p>“Sir, I’ve been waiting here these
two hours for you. You’d better
please let me have a word with
you before you go in”; and Clide
turned into the dining-room, which
the servant of the house civilly
opened for him. “We’ve been
sold. They were off this morning
at six. The three started together.
They are gone to Berlin&mdash;at
least so one of the <i lang="de">kellners</i> let
out to me; the one I spoke to yesterday
was coached-up by the landlord
and the people themselves, I
suppose, for he told me it was Vienna
they were gone to; he had a
trumped-up story about the <i lang="de">fraulein’s</i>
mother being taken suddenly
ill and telegraphing for them.
They are a cunning lot. That piano
was a dodge to put us to
sleep, sir.”</p>

<p>“What proof have you that they
are gone to Berlin? That other
man may be mistaken, or lying to
order like the rest? I must see
the consul and take advice with
him. This scoundrel of a landlord
shall pay for his lies,” said Clide,
beating his foot with a quick, nervous
movement on the ground; “he
must be forced to speak, and to
speak the truth.”</p>

<p>“No need, sir; I’ve found it out
without him. I’ve been to the
railway. I made believe I was the
servant following with luggage that
was forgotten, and they told me the
train they started by and the hour
it arrives, and described them all
three as true as life,” said Stanton.</p>

<p>“And it is <em>she</em>?”</p>

<p>“Not a doubt of it, sir. As certain
as I’m Stanton.” Clide felt
nevertheless that it would be well
to see the consul; the case was so
delicate, so fraught with difficulties
on all sides, that it was desirable at
any cost of personal feeling to
furnish himself with all the information
he could get as to how he
should now proceed, so as not to
entangle things still further.</p>

<p>On hearing his visitor’s strange
tale, the consul’s advice was that
he should see with his own eyes
the person whom he took for granted
was his wife, before venturing on
any active steps. “The fact is
quite clear to you,” he remarked,
“and from what you say it is equally
clear to me; but the evidence
on which we build this assumption
would not hold water for one minute
before a magistrate. Suppose,
after all, it turns out to be a case
of mistaken identity; what a position
you would be in!”</p>

<p>“That is impossible,” affirmed
Clide.</p>

<p>“No, not impossible; highly improbable,
I grant you; but such improbable
things occur every day.
You must have more substantial
ground than second-hand evidence
and corroborating circumstances to
go upon before you stir in the matter,
and then you must do nothing
without proper legal advice.”</p>

<p>Clide recognized the common-sense
and justice of this, and determined
to be advised. He started
for Berlin, and on arriving there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span>
went straight from the railway to
the British Embassy, where he obtained
a letter from the ambassador
to the Minister of Police, requesting
that functionary to give
the young Englishman every assistance
and facility. The minister
was going to bed; it was near
twelve o’clock; the ambassador’s
letter, however, secured the untimely
visitor immediate admission, and
a civil and attentive hearing. He
took some notes down from Clide’s
dictation, and promised that all the
resources of the body which he
controlled should be enlisted in the
matter, and as soon as they had
discovered where the party they
were in pursuit of had alighted, he
would communicate with Mr. de
Winton.</p>

<p>The latter then went to the hotel,
where Stanton had preceded him,
and was waiting impatiently for his
arrival. The moment he entered
the room, Stanton was struck by his
pale, haggard look; he had not
noticed it on the journey; when
the train stopped, they saw each
other in the shade or in the dark,
and after exchanging a hasty word
passed each to his separate buffets
and carriages. It was indeed no
wonder his master should be worn
out after the terrible emotions of
the last few days, added to the continued
travelling and scarcely any
sleep or food, but it did not look
like ordinary fatigue.</p>

<p>“You had better go to bed, sir;
you’ll be used up if you take on like
this; and that won’t mend much,”
he said, when Clide, after lighting a
cigar, flung himself into a chair and
bade Stanton bring him the papers.</p>

<p>“I’ll go to bed presently; bring
me the papers,” repeated Clide, and
the man left the room.</p>

<p>When he returned he found his
master standing up and holding on
by the back of his chair as if to
steady himself.</p>

<p>“I feel queerish, Stanton; get
me some brandy and water; make
haste,” he said, speaking faintly.</p>

<p>Instead of obeying him, Stanton
forced him gently into the chair,
and proceeded to undress him
Clide resigning himself passively to
it, as if he were in a stupor; he let
himself be put to bed in the same
way, like a child too sleepy to
know what was being done to it.</p>

<p>“I don’t like the looks of him at
all,” thought Stanton, as he stole
softly out of the room; “if he’s not
all right to-morrow, I send for the
admiral.”</p>

<p>Clide was not all right in the
morning; he was feverish and exhausted,
and complained in a querulous
way, quite unlike his usual self,
of a burning, hammering pain in
his head. Stanton sent for a medical
man without consulting him.
When he said he had done so, Clide
gave no sign of displeasure; he
did not seem quite to take it in.</p>

<p>“I’ve got fifty thousand toothaches
in my skull, Stanton; what
the deuce is it, eh?” he cried, tossing
from side to side on his pillow.
Then suddenly he raised himself:</p>

<p>“Stanton!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>

<p>“You think I’m going to be ill.
Don’t deny it; I see it in your face.
Perhaps I am; I feel uncommonly
odd here”&mdash;passing his hand over
his forehead&mdash;“but I want to say
one thing while I think of it: you
don’t write a word to any one in
England until the doctor says I’m
a dead man. Do you hear me
speaking to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; but don’t you think
if the admiral…”</p>

<p>“If you attempt to write to
him, I’ll dismiss you that very instant!”
And his eyes flashed angrily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span>
“You mind what I say, Stanton!”</p>

<p>“All right, sir; you know best
what you like about it.”</p>

<p>The excitement seemed to have
exhausted his remaining strength;
he grew rapidly worse; and when
the doctor came, he declared his patient
was in for a brain fever that
might turn to worse unless the circumstances
were specially propitious.</p>

<p>Why should we linger by his bedside?
It would be only a repetition
of the old story; delirium following
on days of pain and restlessness;
a long period of anxiety while
youth battled with the enemy, now
seemingly about to be worsted in
the fight, then rising above the disease
with unexpected starts, showing
how rich and strong the resources
of the young frame were. The
medical man was not communicative
with the valet; he kept his alternations
of hope and fear to himself;
it was only by scrutinizing
the expression of his face as he felt
the patient’s pulse that Stanton
could make a guess at his opinion.
To his eager inquiries on accompanying
the oracle to the door, he
received the uniform reply that this
was a case in which the disease
must run its course, when no one
could say what a day might bring
forth, when much depended on the
quality of the patient’s constitution;
the one drop of comfort Stanton
extracted from him was the emphatic
assurance that in this instance
the patient had a constitution of
gold. The crisis came, and then
Stanton, convinced in his inexperienced
mind that no mortal constitution
could pass this strait, boldly
asked the doctor if it was not time
to write to the family.</p>

<p>“These things must run their
course; in twenty-four hours it will
be decided,” was the sententious
reply.</p>

<p>Stanton was fain to be content
with it, and wait. The day passed,
and the night dragged on slowly as
a passing bell, until at last the decisive
hour came and was passed;
then the medical man spoke again.</p>

<p>“He is saved. The worst is now
over; he is entering on the period
of convalescence.”</p>

<p>The period was long&mdash;longer than
he had anticipated; for the golden
constitution had been fiercely tried
and shaken; it was more than two
months from the day of Clide’s arrival
in Berlin until he was able to
leave the hotel. In the meantime,
what had become of Isabel, or Mme.
Villar, as we shall call her for the
present? All that Stanton could
ascertain was that she had left Berlin
about a week after his master
had been struck down, and had
gone&mdash;so it was said at the hotel
where she and her party put up&mdash;for
a tour in the neighboring spas,
after which she was to proceed to
St. Petersburg to fulfil an engagement
for the season. This was the
last link the police had got hold of;
but as nobody had taken it up at
the time, it was impossible to say
how many others had intervened
in the two months that had gone
by.</p>

<p>It was now late in September.
Clide was very weak still, and unfit
for a long railway journey, and
besides, it was unlikely Mme. Villar
would be yet in St. Petersburg,
assuming that the story of her going
there at all was true. He yielded
therefore to the doctor’s advice,
and went to recruit himself at the
nearest watering-place, after having
again seen the authorities at Berlin,
and urged them not to let the affair
sleep, but to keep a sharp lookout
in every direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span></p>

<p>In the first week of October he
arrived in St. Petersburg. The
city of the Czars looked dreary
and desolate enough in these keen
autumn days; there was not much
movement in its immense market-places&mdash;its
bald, spacious squares,
and high, broad houses standing
unsocial and mistrustful, far apart
in the wide, noiseless streets; but
people were dropping in quickly
from day to day from their country-houses,
getting out their furs, and
settling down for the winter campaign
that was at hand; for the foe
was marching steadily on them,
girt with sullen skies of lead, and
tawny mists, and trumpeted by the
shrill blast of the north wind, a few
strong puffs from whose ice-breathing
nostrils would soon paralyze the
rivers and lay them to sleep under
twenty feet of ice. Clide was weary
after his long ride, and was in a
mood to be exasperated when, on
stepping out of the train, and seeking
for their two portmanteaus amongst
the heaps of luggage, the porters
said they were missing. It was no
small inconvenience, for the said
portmanteaus contained all their
clothes, and nearly all their money.</p>

<p>The officials were very civil,
however, and assured the travellers
that their luggage would be forthcoming
next day. There was nothing
for it but to console themselves
with this promise, and go on
to the hotel. Clide then gave his
purse to Stanton and bade him go
out and purchase such things as
were indispensable for the night.
The valet accordingly set off, accompanied
by an English waiter who
volunteered to interpret for him,
and Clide sallied forth for a stroll
along the Neva, that still flowed
high and free between its broad
quays. He walked on and on, forgetting
time, as was his habit, until
lassitude recalled him to his senses,
and he looked around him and began
to wonder where he had strayed
to. He had drifted far beyond
his intention, and now found himself
on an island where handsome
villas amidst groves and long avenues
were to be seen on every side.
Happily a drosky passed empty at
the moment; he hailed it, gave the
name of his hotel, and drove home.
Stanton had not yet returned.
This was odd, for his interpreter
had come back an hour since, and
said that the valet, after doing all
his commissions, had lingered behind
merely to see the quays, saying
he would follow in ten minutes. It
was impossible he could have lost
his way, for the hotel was in sight.
The fact was, Stanton had had an
adventure. He happened to be
crossing the bridge when he noticed
a man bestriding the parapet at
the other end, swinging from side
to side, and apostrophizing the
lamp-post with great earnestness.
Stanton watched him as he walked
on, mentally wondering how long
this social position would prove
tenable, when the man gave a sudden
lunge, and was precipitated
with a shriek into the water. There
were several foot-passengers close
to the spot; they rushed towards
the parapet, and began screaming
to each other in Russian and gesticulating
with great animation,
hailing everybody and everything
within sight, but no one gave any
sign of doing the only thing that
could be of avail, namely, jumping
in after the drowning man. The
unfortunate wretch was struggling
frantically, and gasping out cries
for help whenever he got his head
above the water. There was a stair
running down from the quay, where
boats were moored to rings in the
wall. Stanton saw this; he was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[609]</a></span>
capital swimmer; so, without stopping
to reflect, he pulled off his
coat, flew down the steps, and
plunged in. A loud cheer rang all
along the parapet, then a breathless
silence followed; the two men in
the water were wrestling in a desperate
embrace; Stanton had the
Russian by the collar, and the latter
with the suicidal impulse of a
drowning man, was clutching him
wildly, and dragging him down with
all his might. Happily, he was no
match for the Englishman’s sinewy
arms; Stanton shook himself
free with a vigorous effort, swam
out a few yards, then he turned and
swam back, caught the drowning
man by the hair, and drew him on
with him to the steps. A thundering
salvo greeted his achievement;
the group had now swelled to a
crowd, and a score of spectators
came tumbling down the steps
gabbling their congratulations, and,
what was more to the purpose,
helping the hero to lift the rescued
man on to the steps, and then haul
him up to the landing-place. Stanton
broke through the press to
snatch up his coat, and was elbowing
his way out, when two individuals,
whom he rightly took for
policemen, came up to him, and
began to hold forth volubly in the
same unintelligible jargon. Stanton
only understood, by their pointing
to some place and clutching him by
the shoulder, that they wanted him
to accompany them. With native instinct,
Stanton suspected they were
proposing a tribute of admiration
to him in the shape of a bumper at
the tavern; but he was more intent
on his wet clothes, and, thanking
them by signs, indicated that
he must go in the opposite direction,
shouting meanwhile, at the
very top of his lungs, “Hôtel Peterhof!
I’m going to Peterhof!”
But the policemen shook their
heads, and still pointed and tugged,
until, finding further expostulation
useless, one of them took a stout
grip of Stanton’s collar and proceeded
to drag him on, <i lang="la">nolens volens</i>.
The British lion rose up in Stanton
“and roared a roar.” He levelled
his clenched fist at the aggressor’s
chest, struck him a vigorous blow,
and in language more forcible than
genteel bade him stand off. But
the Russian held on like grim death,
gabbling away harder than ever,
and pointing with his left thumb to
the <em>spit</em> on his own breast, and then
touching the corresponding spot on
Stanton’s wet shirt; but Stanton
would not see it. He doubled up
his fist for another blow, when the
other policeman suddenly caught
him by both arms, and pinned his
elbows as in a vise behind his back.
The crowd had gone on swelling,
and now numbered several hundred
persons; they crushed round the infuriated
Englishman, who stood
there the picture of impotent rage,
dripping and foaming and appealing
to everybody to help him. At
this juncture a carriage drove up;
the coachman stopped to know
what was going on; and great was
Stanton’s joy when he heard a voice
cry out to him in English: “You
must go with them; they won’t
hurt; they are going to give you a
decoration for saving a man’s life.”</p>

<p>“Confound their decoration!
What the devil do I want with
their decoration? Tell them I’m
not a Russian!”</p>

<p>“They know that, but it don’t
matter; the law is the same for
natives and foreigners,” explained
the coachman.</p>

<p>“Hang it, I’m not a foreigner;
what do you take me for? I’m an
Englishman!” protested Stanton.</p>

<p>“Don’t matter; you must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[610]</a></span>
decorated; you may as well do it,
and be done with it.”</p>

<p>“But look at my clothes, man!
I’m as wet as a drowned rat!”</p>

<p>“Served you right! What business
had you jumping into the
water after a fool that wanted to
drown himself?”</p>

<p>“I wish I’d let him,” said Stanton
devoutly; “but just you tell
these chaps to let me go or else
they’ll ’ear of it; tell them my
master will go to the ambassador
and get them flogged all round;
tell them that, and see what comes
of it.”</p>

<p>“No good. The law is the law.
Good morning to you; take a
friend’s advice, and keep your
skin dry next time”; and, nodding
to Stanton, he touched his horses
and was off at a pace.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to
resign himself to his fate. Stanton
ceased all resistance, and let himself
be led to the altar where glory
awaited him in the form of a yellow
<em>spit</em>. He was marched on to a
large, barrack-like building; two
sentries were mounting guard over
its ponderous iron gate. He passed
through them and was marched
from bureau to bureau, addressed
by several officials in every tongue
under the sun, it seemed to him,
till they came to the right one, requested
to record his name, age,
and state of life in several ominous-looking
books, and on each occasion
was embraced and shaken
hands with by the presiding genius
of the bureau; at last he was
brought into the presence of a
gold-laced and highly decorated
individual, who handed him a written
document, very stiff and very
long, and with this a knot of ribbon.
Stanton without more ado
was stuffing both into the pocket
of his soaked pantaloons, when
the gold-laced gentleman exclaimed
with friendly warmth, “Oh! you
must permit me to place the <em>spit</em>
upon your breast!” Upon which
the Englishman recoiled three
steps with a scowl of disgust, and
bade him do it if he dared. The
official, apparently surprised to see
his polite offer met so ungraciously,
forbore to press it, and demanded
the fee. “The fee!&mdash;what fee?”
He explained that a fee was always
paid on receipt of a decoration.
Stanton declined paying it, for the
substantial reason that he had no
money; his luggage had been lost
on the railway; so had his master’s.
The polite gentleman was
very sorry to hear of their misadventure,
but the law was inexorable&mdash;every
man who performed that
noble feat of saving a Russian’s
life should be decorated, and the
decoration involved a fee.</p>

<p>“Then what in the name of the
furies do you want me to do?”
cried the exasperated Stanton; “I
can’t coin any, can I?”</p>

<p>No; this was not a practical alternative,
but very likely his master
could devise one; he would have
no difficulty in getting credit for
the amount; any one in St. Petersburg
would be happy to accommodate
a milord with so small a sum,
or indeed any sum.</p>

<p>Stanton had nothing for it but to
write a line to the Peterhof explaining
his pitiable position, and
entreating his master to come to
the rescue without delay.</p>

<p>It was late in the evening when
this missive was handed to Clide.
The landlord, with the utmost alacrity,
placed the coffers of the Peterhof
at his disposal, and sent for a
carriage to convey him to the scene
of his valet’s distress.</p>

<p>“If ever any one catches me
saving a Russian fellow’s life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[611]</a></span>
again may I be drowned myself!”
was Stanton’s ejaculation as he
shut his master into the cab, and
drove home with the <em>spit</em> in his
pocket.</p>

<p>This little incident gave Clide
some food for reflection, and
aroused in him a prudent desire to
make some acquaintance with the
ways and customs of Muscovy before
he went further. A little
knowledge of the code which included
such a very peculiar law
as the aforementioned might prove
not only desirable but essential, before
he entangled himself in its
treacherous meshes. A paternal
government might have its advantages,
but clearly it had its drawbacks.
Russia was almost the only
spot in the so-called civilized world
that he had not explored in the
course of his wanderings, so the
people and their laws were as unknown
to him practically as the
people and the laws of the Feejee
Islands. He had gone once as far
as Warsaw with the intention of
pushing on to Russia, but what
he saw in the Polish city of her
spirit and national character sickened
and horrified him; he turned
his back on the scene of her cruelty
and demoralizing rule, and went
down to Turkey. There at least
barbarism reigned with a comparatively
gentle sceptre, and wore no
hypocrite’s mask. He had not furnished
himself with a single letter
of introduction to St. Petersburg.
It never entered into his imagination
when leaving London that he
should want any; he did not dream
that the will-o’-the-wisp he was
chasing would have led him so far.
But he was here now, and he must
find some one to steer him safe
through quicksands and sunken
rocks.</p>

<p>There was no doubt an English
lawyer in the city to whom he could
safely apply. The landlord of the
Peterhof gave him the address of
one. It was a Russian name, but he
assured Clide that it was that of
the English lawyer of St. Petersburg,
who managed all the law affairs
of English residents. Clide
went to this gentleman’s office, and
found a small, urbane little man,
who spoke English with a very
pure accent and fluently, but with
Muscovite written on every line of
his face. It was of no consequence,
however, as he showed his
client in the first few questions he
put that he was in the habit of
dealing with English people and
transacting confidential and intricate
cases for them. The present
one he frankly admitted was without
precedent in his legal experience,
and his advice to Clide was
pretty much the same as the consul’s,
reinforced, however, by a
rather startling argument.</p>

<p>“You must first prove beyond a
doubt that it is not a case of mistaken
identity, and, even when this
is done, you have to consider whether
it is expedient to run the risks
that must attend any active proceedings
against the persons in question.
Let us consider the facts as
they stand, setting aside possible
antecedents. The lady is engaged
here for the season. I can guarantee
that much. I heard her repeatedly
last year, and the announcement,
on the night of her last appearance,
that she was to return
next season, was received with an
enthusiasm that I cannot describe.
She is, therefore, an established favorite
with the public. This in itself
is a fact fraught with danger to
any one seeking to molest her&mdash;I
use the word from the point of view
of the public&mdash;any person interfering
with so important a branch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[612]</a></span>
their pleasure as the opera would
expose himself to disagreeable consequences.
The government is paternally
anxious that the people
should be amused. It is not wise
to thwart a paternal government.…
The Czar, moreover, has shown
decided appreciation of this prima
donna. He condescended to receive
her into the imperial box and
himself clasp a costly diamond
bracelet on her arm. He and the
rest of the royal family are to be
present at her first reappearance.
No one, be they ever so guilty, can
be attacked with impunity while
under the favor of the imperial
smile. A paternal government is
not trammelled by the conventionalisms
and routine that check the action
of other forms of government;
it acts promptly, decisively. If you
meddle in this matter rashly, you
may find yourself in very unpleasant
circumstances.”</p>

<p>“I should agree with all you say
if I were a subject of the Russian
government,” said Clide, “but I
am an Englishman; surely that
makes a difference?”</p>

<p>The lawyer smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“I would not advise you to count
upon it for security. I have known
some Englishmen whose nationality
did not prove such a talisman as
they expected.”</p>

<p>“You mean that they have been
imprisoned without offence or trial,
treated like Russian subjects?”
Clide’s lip curled under his moustache
as he emitted the monstrous
proposition.</p>

<p>“I mean to give you the best advice
in my power,” returned the
urbane lawyer with unruffled coolness.
“You have come to me for
counsel. You are free to follow it
or not as you see good.”</p>

<p>“So far, you have given me only
negative advice. You tell me what
I must not do; can you tell me nothing
that I can and ought to do?”
said Clide.</p>

<p>“For the present, I can only urge
you to be prudent. One rash act
may precipitate you into a still
worse dilemma than the present.
See this lady for yourself, and see
the man who accompanies her. I
do not advise you to speak to them,
nor even to let them know of your
presence here, still less of your intentions.
The man, from what you
already know of him, is likely to be
an unscrupulous fellow, a dangerous
enemy to cope with. He&mdash;on account
of his pupil or niece&mdash;has patrons
in high place. If he got wind
of your designs, he might frustrate
them in a manner … that …
that you don’t foresee.…” The lawyer
paused, and bent his sharp
green eyes on Clide with a meaning
that was not to be misunderstood.</p>

<p>“You mean that the government
would connive at or assist him in
some personal violence to me?”</p>

<p>“I mean to advise you honestly.
I might put you off with a sham, or
lay a trap for you; I should be well
paid for it. But I traffic as little as
possible in that sort of thing, and
<em>never</em> with an English client.” It
was impossible to doubt the genuine
frankness in this assurance, coupled
as it was with the implied admission
that the lawyer was less incorruptible
to native clients. Clide
was convinced the man was dealing
fairly by him.</p>

<p>“And when I have seen them
both, and thus put a seal on certainty&mdash;what
next?”</p>

<p>“Wait until the season is over;
then follow them to their next destination,
out of Russia, and take
counsel with a shrewd legal man of
the place. My own opinion is that
your wisest course would be to do
nothing until you can attack the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[613]</a></span>
affair in England: the mere fact of
being a foreigner puts barriers in
the way of the law for helping you
anywhere; but, as you value your
liberty, don’t interfere with a prima
donna who is in favor with the
Court of St. Petersburg&mdash;it were
safer for you to play with fire.”</p>

<p>Clide laid a large fee on the lawyer’s
green table, and wished him
good morning.</p>

<p>He hesitated as he was stepping
into his fly. Should he go to the
British Embassy, and lay the whole
story before Lord X&mdash;&mdash;, and so
place one strong barrier between
him and the monstrous possibilities
with which the lawyer had threatened
him? He stood for a moment
with his hand on the door,
which Stanton was holding open
for him; his forehead had that hard
line straight down between the horizontal
bars over his eyes that had
once so scared Franceline. “To
the hotel!” he said, slamming the
door, and Stanton jumped up beside
the coachman.</p>

<p>They had gone about a hundred
yards when the window was pulled
down in front, and Clide called out:
“To the British Embassy!”</p>

<p>The horse’s head was turned that
way. While they were rattling
over the stones, Clide was arguing
his change of resolution, and trying
to justify it. “I will burn my ship
and take the consequences. What
balderdash he talked about the
danger of letting the man know of
my intentions! How the deuce
could they harm me? If I were a
Russian, no doubt; but the government
would hardly run their neck
into such a noose as assault or imprisonment
of a British subject for
the sake of a popular prima donna!
Pshaw! I was an idiot to mind
him.”</p>

<p>The coachman pulled up before
the British Embassy. Two private
carriages stopped at the same moment,
gentlemen alighted from them
and ran up the steps. Stanton
held the door open for his master,
but Clide did not move; he sat with
his head bent forward, examining
his boots, to all appearance unconscious
of his valet’s presence.</p>

<p>“Here we are, sir; this is the
Embassy,” said Stanton. But Clide
sat dumb, as if he were glued to the
seat. At last, starting from his revery,
he said “Home!” and flung
himself back in the carriage.</p>

<p>“That fever has left him a bit
queer,” thought Stanton, as he
closed the door on his capricious
master.</p>

<p>“What a fool’s errand it would
be!” muttered Clide to himself;
“and what have I to say to Lord
X&mdash;&mdash;? If it <em>should</em> turn out to be
a case of mistaken identity.…
The lawyer’s advice is after all the
safest and the most rational.”</p>

<h3>SPACE.<br />
<span class="smaller">II.</span></h3>

<p>It is of the utmost importance
in the philosophical investigation in
which we have engaged to bear in
mind that the power by which we
attain to the knowledge of the intrinsic
nature of things is not our
imagination, but our intellect. The
office of imagination is to form
sensible representations of what lies
at the surface of the things apprehended;
the intellect alone is competent
to reach what lies under that
surface, that is, the essential principles
of the thing, and their ontological
relations. This remark is so
obvious that it may seem superfluous;
but our imagination has such
a power in fashioning our thoughts,
and such an obtrusive manner of
interfering with our mental processes,
that we need to be reminded,
in season and out of season, of our
liability to mistake its suggestions
for intellectual conceptions. What
we have said about absolute space
in our past article shows that even
renowned philosophers are liable to
such mistakes; for nothing but
imagination could have led Balmes,
Descartes, and many others, to confound
absolute space with the material
extension of bodies. As to
relative space, the danger of confounding
its intellectual notion with
our sensible representation of it, is,
perhaps, less serious, when we have
understood the nature of absolute
space; yet, here too we are obliged
to guard against the incursions
of the imaginative faculty, which
will not cease to obtrude itself, in
the shape of an auxiliary, upon our
intellectual ground.</p>

<p>Absolute space cannot become
relative unless it be extrinsically
terminated, or occupied, by distinct
terms. Hence, in passing from the
consideration of absolute space to
that of relative space, the first question
by which we are met is the following:</p>

<p>Is absolute space intrinsically
modified or affected by being occupied?
or, <em>Does the creation of a
material point in space entail an intrinsic
modification of absolute space?</em></p>

<p>The answer to this question cannot
be doubtful. Absolute space
is not and cannot be intrinsically
affected or modified by the presence
of a material point, or of any number
of material points. We have
shown that absolute space is nothing
else than the virtuality of
God’s immensity; and since no intrinsic
change can be conceived as
possible in God’s attributes or in
the range of their comprehension, it
is evident that absolute space cannot
be intrinsically modified by any
work of creation. On the other
hand, nothing can be intrinsically
modified unless it receives in itself,
as in a subject, the modifying act;
for all intrinsic modifications result
from corresponding impressions
made on the subject which is modified.
Thus the modifications of
the eye, of the ear, and of other
senses, result from impressions
made on them, and received in
them as in so many subjects. But
the creation of a material point in
space is not the position of a thing
in it as in a subject; for, if absolute
space received the material point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span>
in itself as in a subject, this point
would be a mere accident; as nothing
but accidents exist in a subject,
and since it is manifest that
material elements are not accidents,
it is plain that they are not received
in space as in a subject.</p>

<p>Hence the creation of any number
of material points in space implies
nothing but the <em>extrinsic</em> termination
of absolute space, which
accordingly remains altogether unaffected
and unmodified. Just as a
body created at the surface of the
earth immediately acquires weight,
without causing the least intrinsic
change in the attractive power
which is the source of all weights
on earth, so does a material element,
created in absolute space, acquire
its ubication without causing the
least intrinsic change in absolute
space which is the source of all
possible ubications. A material
element has its formal ubication inasmuch
as it occupies a point in
space. This point, as contained in
absolute space, is virtual; but, as
occupied by the element, or marked
out by a point of matter, it is formal.
Thus the formality of the
ubication consists in the actual termination
and real occupation of a
virtual point by an extrinsic term
corresponding to it.</p>

<p>The formal ubication of an element
is a mere relativity, or a <em>respectus</em>.
The formal reason, or
foundation, of this relativity is the
reality through which the term
ubicated communicates with absolute
space, viz., the real point
which is common to both, though
not in the same manner, as it is
<em>virtual</em> in space, and <em>formal</em> in the
extrinsic term. A material element
in space is therefore nothing
but a term related by its ubication
to divine immensity as existing in a
more perfect manner in the same
ubication. But since the formality
of the contingent ubication exclusively
belongs to the contingent
being itself, absolute space receives
nothing from it except a relative
extrinsic denomination.</p>

<p>Some will say: To have a capacity
of containing something, and to
contain it actually, are things intrinsically
different. But absolute
space, when void, has a mere capacity
of containing bodies, whilst,
when occupied, it actually contains
them. Therefore absolute space is
intrinsically modified by occupation.</p>

<p>To this we answer, that the word
“capacity,” on which the objection
is built up, is a mischievous one,
no less indeed than the word “potency,”
which, when used indeterminately,
is liable to opposite interpretations,
and leads to contradictory
conclusions.</p>

<p>The capacity of containing bodies
which is commonly predicated of
absolute space, is not a passive potency
destined to be actuated by
contingent occupation; it is, on the
contrary, the formal reason of all
contingent ubications, since it contains
already in an infinitely better
manner all the ubications of the
bodies by which it may be occupied.
To be occupied, and not to be occupied,
are not, of course, the same
thing; but it does not follow from
this that space unoccupied is intrinsically
different from space occupied;
it follows only, that, when
space is occupied, a contingent being
corresponds to it as an extrinsic
term, and gives it an extrinsic
denomination. In other terms,
everything which occupies space,
occupies it by ubication. Now
every ubication is the participation
in the contingent being of a reality
which absolute space already contains
in a better manner. Consequently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[616]</a></span>
the capacity of containing
bodies, which is predicated of space,
already <em>contains actually</em> the same
ubications, which, when bodies are
created, are formally attributed to
the bodies themselves.</p>

<p>This answer is, we think, philosophically
evident. But, as our imagination,
too, must be helped to
rise to the level of intellectual conceptions,
we will illustrate our answer
by an example. Man has features
which can be reflected in any
number of mirrors, so as to form in
them an image of him. This “capacity”
of having images of self is
called “exemplarity,” and consists
in the possession of that of which
an image can be produced. Hence,
man’s exemplarity actually, though
only virtually, contains in itself all
the images that it can form in any
mirror; and when the image is
formed, man’s exemplarity gives
existence to it, but receives nothing
from it, except a relative denomination
drawn from the extrinsic term
in which it is portrayed. In a like
manner, God’s omnipotence, and
his other attributes, are mirrored in
every created thing, and their “capacity”
of being imitated in a finite
degree arises from the fact that
God’s attributes contain already in
an eminent manner the whole reality
which can be made to exist formally
in the contingent things.
Hence, when these contingent things
are created, God gives existence to
them, but receives nothing from
them, except a relative denomination
drawn from the extrinsic terms
in which his perfections are mirrored.
In the same manner, too,
when a material element is created,
it receives its being, and its mode
of being in space, that is, its ubication,
which is a finite image or imitation
of God’s infinite ubication;
but it gives nothing to the divine
ubication, except the extrinsic denomination;
just as the image in
the mirror gives nothing to the
body of which it is the image, but
simply borrows its existence from it.</p>

<p>From this it follows that material
elements are in space <em>not by inhesion,
but by correlation</em>, each point
which is formally marked out by an
element corresponding to a virtual
point of space, to which it gives an
extrinsic denomination. The said
correlation consists in this, that the
contingent term, by its formal mode
of existing in the point it marks
out, really imitates the eminent
mode of being of divine immensity
in the same point; and from this it
follows again, that whatever new
reality results from the existence of
a material element in space, belongs
entirely to the element itself, and
constitutes its mode of being.</p>

<p>The relation between the contingent
being as existing formally in
its ubication, and divine immensity
as existing eminently in the same
ubication, is called “presence.”</p>

<p>We must notice, before we go
further, that the virtuality of God’s
immensity, when considered in relation
to the distinct terms by
which it is extrinsically terminated,
assumes distinct relative denominations,
and therefore, though it is one
entitatively, it becomes manifold
terminatively. In this latter sense
it is true to say that the virtuality
of divine immensity which is terminated
by a certain term <em>A</em>, is distinct
from the virtuality which is
terminated by a certain other term
<em>B</em>; and when a material point
moves in space, we may say that
its ubication ceases to correspond
to one virtuality of immensity, and
begins to correspond to another.
Such virtualities, as we have just
remarked, are not entitatively distinct,
for immensity has but <em>one</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[617]</a></span>
infinite virtuality. Yet this <em>one</em> virtuality,
owing to the possibility of
infinite distinct terminations, is capable
of being related to any number
of distinct extrinsic terms, and
of receiving from their distinct
mode of existing in it any number
of distinct relative denominations.
When, therefore, we speak of distinct
virtualities of divine immensity,
we simply refer to the distinct
extrinsic terminations of one and
the same infinite virtuality, in the
same manner as, when we speak
of distinct creations, we do not
mean that God’s creative act is
manifold in itself, but only that its
extrinsic termination to one being,
v. gr. the sun, is not its termination
to other beings, v. gr. the stars.
And in a similar manner, when a
word is heard by many persons, its
sound in their ears is distinct on
account of distinct terminations,
though the word is not distinct from
itself.</p>

<p>We have explained the origin
and nature of formal ubication;
we have yet to point out its division.
Ubication may be considered
either <em>objectively</em> or <em>subjectively</em>.
Objectively considered, it is nothing
else than a <em>point in space marked
out by a simple point of matter</em>.
We say, <em>by a simple point</em> of matter,
because distinct material points
in space have distinct ubications.
Hence, we cannot approve those
philosophers who confound the <i lang="la">ubi</i>
with the <i lang="la">locus</i>, that is, the ubication
with the place occupied by a body.
It is true that those philosophers
held the continuity of matter; but
they should have seen all the same
that all dimensions involved distinct
ubications, and that every
term designable in such dimensions
has an ubication of its own
independent of the ubications of
every other designable term; which
proves that the <i lang="la">locus</i> of a body implies
a great number of ubications,
and therefore cannot be considered
as the synonym of <i lang="la">ubi</i>.</p>

<p>If the ubication is considered
subjectively, that is, as an appurtenance
of the subject of which it is
predicated, it may be defined as <em>the
mode of being of a simple element in
space</em>. This mode consists of a
mere relativity; for it results from
the extrinsic termination of absolute
space, as already explained.
Hence, the ubication is not <em>received</em>
in the subject of which it
is predicated, and does not <em>inhere</em>
in it, but, like all other relativities
and connotations, simply connects
it with its correlative, and lies, so
to say, between the two.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>But, although it consists of a
mere relativity, the ubication still
admits of being divided into <em>absolute</em>
and <em>relative</em>, according as it is
conceived absolutely as it is in itself,
or compared with other ubications.
Nor is this strange; for
relative entities can be considered
both as to what they are in themselves,
and as to what they are to
one another. Likeness, for instance,
is a relation; and yet when
we know the likeness of Peter to
Paul, and the likeness of Peter to
John, we can still compare the one
likeness with the other, and pronounce
that the one is greater than
the other.</p>

<p>When the ubication is considered
simply as a termination of absolute
space without regard for
anything else, then we call it <em>absolute</em>,
and we define it as <em>the mode
of being of an element in absolute
space</em>, by which the element is
constituted in the divine presence.
This absolute ubication is
an <em>essential mode</em> of the material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[618]</a></span>
element no less than its dependence
from the first cause, and is altogether
immutable so long as the
element exists; for, on the one
hand, the element cannot exist but
within the domain of divine immensity,
and, on the other, it cannot
have different modes of being
with regard to it, as absolute space
is the same all throughout, and the
element, however much we may try
to imagine different positions for it,
must always be in the centre, so
to say, of that infinite expanse.
Hence, absolute ubication is altogether
unchangeable.</p>

<p>When the ubication of one element
is compared with that of another
element in order to ascertain
their mutual relation in space, then
the ubication is called <em>relative</em>, and,
as such, it may be defined as <em>the
mode of terminating a relation in
space</em>. This ubication is changeable,
not in its intrinsic entity, but
in its relative formality; and it is
only under this formality that the
ubication can be ranked among
the predicamental accidents; for
this changeable formality is the
only thing in it which bears the
stamp of an accidental entity.</p>

<p>The consideration of relative
ubications leads us directly to
the consideration of the relation
existing between two points distinctly
ubicated in space. Such a
relation is called <em>distance</em>. Distance
is commonly considered as a
quantity; yet it is not primarily
a quantity, but simply the relation
existing between two ubications
with room for movement
from the one to the other. Nevertheless,
this very possibility of
movement from one point to another
gives us a sufficient foundation
for considering the relation of distance
as a virtual dimensive quantity.
For the movement which is
possible between two distant points
may be greater or less, according
to the different manners in which
these points are related. Now,
more and less imply quantity.</p>

<p>The quantity of distance is essentially
continuous. For it is by
continuous movement that the
length of the distance is measured.
The point which by its movement
measures the distance, describes a
straight line by the shifting of its
ubication from one term of the distance
to the other. The distance,
as a relation, is the object of the
intellect, but, as a virtual quantity,
it is the object of imagination also.
We cannot conceive distances as relations
without at the same time
apprehending them as quantities.
For, as we cannot estimate distances
except by the extent of the
movement required in order to pass
from one of its terms to the other,
we always conceive distances as
relative quantities of length; and
yet distances, objectively, are only
relations, by which such quantities
of length are determined. The true
quantity of length is <em>the line</em> which
is drawn, or can be drawn, by the
movement of a point from term to
term. In fact, a line which reaches
from term to term exhibits in itself
the extent of the movement by
which it is generated, and it may
rightly be looked upon as a track
of it, inasmuch as the point, which
describes it, formally marks by its
gliding ubication all the intermediate
space. The marking is, of
course, a transient act; but transient
though it is, it gives to the
intermediate space a permanent
connotation; for a fact once passed,
remains a fact for ever. Thus the
gliding ubication leaves a permanent,
intelligible, though invisible,
mark of its passage; and this we
call a geometric line. The line is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[619]</a></span>
therefore, formally, a quantity of
length, whereas the distance is only
virtually a quantity, inasmuch as it
determines the length of the movement
by which the line can be described.
Nevertheless, since we
cannot, as already remarked, conceive
distances without referring
the one of its terms to the other
through space, and, therefore, without
drawing, at least mentally, a
line from the one to the other, all
distances, as known to us, are already
measured in some manner,
and consequently they exhibit themselves
as formal quantities. Distance
is the base of all dimensions
in space, and its extension is measured
by movement. It is therefore
manifest that no extension in
space is conceivable without movement,
and all quantity of extension
is measured by movement.</p>

<p>We have said that distance is a
relation between two terms as existing
in distinct ubications; and
we have now to inquire what is the
foundation of such a relation. This
question is of high philosophical
importance, as on its solution depends
whether some of our arguments
against Pantheism are or are
not conclusive. Common people,
and a great number of philosophers
too, confound relations with their
foundation, and do not reflect that
when they talk of distances as <em>relative
spaces</em>, they do not speak with
sufficient distinctness.</p>

<p>We are going to show that relative
space must be distinguished
from distances, as well as from geometric
surfaces and volumes, although
these quantities are also
called “relative spaces” by an improper
application of words. Relative
space is not an intrinsic constituent,
but only an extrinsic foundation,
of these relative quantities;
hence these quantities cannot be
styled “relative spaces” without
attributing to the formal results
what strictly belongs to their formal
reason.</p>

<p>What is relative space? Whoever
understands the meaning of
the words will say that relative
space is that through which the
movement from a point to another
point is possible. Now, the possibility
of movement can be viewed
under three different aspects. First,
as a possibility dependent on the
active power of a mover; for movement
is impossible without a mover.
Secondly, as a possibility dependent
on the passivity of the movable
term; for no movement can be
imparted to a term which does not
receive the momentum. Thirdly,
as a possibility dependent on the
perviousness of space which allows
a free passage to the moving point;
for this is absolutely necessary for
the possibility of movement.</p>

<p>In the present question, it is evident
that the possibility of movement
cannot be understood either in the
first or in the second of these three
manners; for our question does not
regard the relation of the agent to
the patient, or of the patient to the
agent, but merely the relation of
one ubication to another, and the
freedom for movement between
them. If the possibility of movement
were taken here as originating
in a motive power, such a possibility
would be greater or less according
to the greater or less power;
and thus the relativity of two
given ubications would be changed
without altering their relation in
space; which is absurd. And if
the possibility of movement were
taken as resulting from the passivity
of the term moved, then, since
this passivity is a mere indifference
to receive the motion, and since indifference
has no degrees, it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[620]</a></span>
follow that the possibility of movement
would be always the same;
and therefore the relativity of the
ubications would remain the same,
even though the ubications were
relatively changed; which is another
absurdity. Accordingly, the
possibility of movement which is
involved in the conception of relative
space is that which arises from
space itself, whose virtual extension
virtually contains all possible lines
of movement, and allows any such
lines to be formally drawn through
it by actual movement.</p>

<p>From this it follows that relative
space is nothing else than <em>absolute
space as extrinsically terminated by
distinct terms, and affording room for
movement between them</em>. It follows,
further, that this space is relative,
not because it is itself related, but
because it is that through which the
extrinsic terms are related. It is
actively, not passively, relative; it
is the <i lang="la">ratio</i>, not the <i lang="la">rationatum</i>, the
foundation, not the result, of the
relativities. It follows, also, that
the foundation of the relation of
distance is nothing else than space
as terminated by two extrinsic
terms, and affording room for movement
from the one to the other.
This space is at the same time absolute
and relative; absolute as to its
entity, relative as to the extrinsic
denomination derived from the relation
of which it is the formal reason.</p>

<p>The distinction between absolute
and relative space is therefore to be
taken, not from space itself, but
from its comparison with absolute
or with relative ubications. Space,
as absolute, exhibits the possibility
of all absolute ubications; as relative,
it exhibits the possibility of
all ubicational changes. Absolute
space may therefore be styled
simply “the region of ubications,”
whilst relative space maybe defined
as “the region of movement.”</p>

<p>This notion of relative space will
not fail to be opposed by those who
think that all real space results
from the dimensions of bodies.
Their objections, however, need
not detain us here, as we have
already shown that the grounds of
their argumentation are inadmissible.
The same notion will be opposed
with greater plausibility by
those who confound the formal reason
of local relations with the relations
themselves, under the common
name of relative space. Their
objections are based on the popular
language, as used, even by philosophers,
in connection with relative
space. We will reduce these objections
to two heads, and answer
them, together with two others
drawn from other sources, that our
reader may thus form a clearer
judgment of the doctrine we have
developed.</p>

<p><i>First difficulty.</i> The entity of a
relation is the entity of its foundation.
If, then, the foundation of
the relation of distance is absolute
space, or the virtuality of God’s
immensity, it follows that the entity
of distance is an uncreated entity.
But this cannot be admitted, except
by Pantheists. Therefore the relation
of distance is not founded on
the virtuality of God’s immensity.</p>

<p>This difficulty arises from a false
supposition. The entity of the relation
is <em>not</em> the entity of its foundation,
but it is the entity of the connotation
(<i lang="la">respectus</i>) which arises
from the existence of the terms under
such a foundation. Likeness,
for instance, is a relation resulting
between two bodies, say, white, on
account of their common property,
say, whiteness. Whiteness is therefore
the foundation of their likeness;
but whiteness it not likeness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span>
On the contrary, the whiteness
which founds this relation is still
competent to found innumerable
other relations; a thing which
would be impossible if the entity
of the foundation were not infinitely
superior to the entity of the relation
which results from it.</p>

<p>This is even more evident in our
case; for the foundation of the relation
between two ubications is an
entity altogether extrinsic to the
ubications themselves, as we have
already shown. Evidently, such an
entity cannot be the relativity of
those ubications. The relation of
distance is neither absolute nor relative
space, but only the mode of
being of one term in space with respect
to another term in space.
Now, surely no one who has any
knowledge of things will maintain
that space, either absolute or relative,
is a mode of being. The moon
is distant from the earth; and therefore
there is space, and possibility
of movement, between the moon
and the earth. But is this space
<em>the relation</em> of distance? No. It
is the ground of the relation. The
relation itself consists in the mode
of being of the moon with respect
to the earth; and, evidently, this
mode is not space.</p>

<p>The assumption that the entity
of the relation is the entity of its
foundation may be admitted in the
case of transcendental relations,
inasmuch as the actuality of beings,
which results from the conspiration
of their essential principles, identifies
itself <i lang="la">in concreto</i> with the beings
themselves. But the same cannot
be said of predicamental relations.
It would be absurd to say that the
dependence of the world on its
Creator is the creative act; nor
would it be less absurd to say that
the relativity of a son to his father
is the act of generation, or that the
fraternity of James and John is the
same thing as the identity of
Zebedee, their father, with himself.
And yet these absurdities, and
many others, must be admitted, if
we admit the assumption that the
entity of predicamental relations
is the entity of their foundation.
Hence the assumption must be discarded
as false; and the objection,
which rested entirely on this assumption,
needs no further discussion.</p>

<p>We must, however, take this opportunity
to again warn the student
of the necessity of not confounding
under one and the same name the
relative space with the relations of
things existing in space. This confusion
is very frequent, as we often
hear of distances, surfaces, and volumes
of bodies spoken of as “relative
spaces,” which, properly speaking,
they are not. We ourselves
are now and then obliged to use
this inaccurate language, owing to
the difficulty of conveying our
thoughts to common readers without
employing common phrases.
But we would suggest that, to avoid
all misconstruction of such phrases,
the relative space, of which we
have determined the notion, might
be called “<em>fundamental</em> relative
space,” whilst the relations of things
as existing in space might receive
the name of “<em>resultant</em> relative
spaces.” At any rate, without
some epithets of this sort, we cannot
turn to good account the popular
phraseology on the subject.
Such a phraseology expresses things
as they are represented in our imagination,
not as they are defined
by our reason. Distances are intervals
between certain points in
space, surfaces are intervals between
certain lines in space, volumes are
intervals between certain surfaces
in spaces; but these intervals are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span>
no <em>parts</em> of space, though they are
very frequently so called, but only
relations in space. Space is one,
not many; it has no parts, and,
whether you call it absolute or relative,
it cannot be cut to pieces.
What is called an interval <em>of</em> space
should rather be called an interval
<em>in</em> space; for it is not a portion of
space, but a relation of things in
space; it is not a length of space,
but the length of the movement
possible between the extrinsic terms
of space; it is not a divisible extension,
but the ground on which
movement can extend with its divisible
extension. In the smallest
conceivable interval of space there
is God, with all his immensity. To
affirm that intervals of space are
distinct spaces would be to cut
God’s immensity into pieces, by
giving it a distinct being in really
distinct intervals. It is therefore
necessary to concede that, whilst
the intervals are distinct, the space
on which they have their foundation
is one and the same.</p>

<p>Pantheists have taken advantage
of the confusion of fundamental
space with the resulting relations in
space, to spread their absurd theories.
If we grant them that <em>distance
is space</em>, how can we refute
their assertion that distance is a
form under which divine substance,
or the Absolute, makes an apparition?
For, if distance is space, and
space is no creature, distance consists
of something uncreated (and
therefore divine) under a contingent
form. This is not the place
for us to refute Pantheism; what
we aim at is simply to point out
the need we have of expressing our
thoughts on space with philosophical
accuracy, lest the Pantheists
may shield themselves with our
own loose phraseology.</p>

<p>God is everywhere, and touches,
so to say, every contingent ubication
by his presence to every ubicated
thing. But the contingent
ubications are not spaces, nor anything
intrinsic to space; they are
merely extrinsic terms, corresponding
to space, as we have explained;
and therefore such ubications are
not apparitions of the divine substance,
but apparitions of contingent
things; they are not points of
divine immensity, but points contingently
projected on the virtuality
of God’s immensity. It is as vain
to pretend that contingent ubications
are points of space, as it is
vain to pretend that contingent essences
are the divine substance.
Pantheists, indeed, have said that,
because the essences of things are
contained in God, the substance of
all things must be God’s substance;
but their paralogism is manifest.
For the essences of things are in
God, not formally with the entity
which they have in created things,
but eminently and virtually, that
is, in an infinitely better manner.
The formal essences of things are
<em>only</em> in the things themselves, and
they are extrinsic terms of creation,
imperfect images of what exists
perfect in God. In the same manner
the ubications of things are not
in God formally, but eminently and
virtually. They formally belong to
the things that are ubicated. So
also the intervals of space are in
God eminently, not formally; they
formally arise from extrinsic terminations,
and therefore are mere
correlations of creatures. This
suffices to show that distances and
other relations in space involve nothing
divine in their entity, although
they are grounded on the existence
and universal presence of God, in
whom “we live, and move, and
have our being.”</p>

<p><i>Second difficulty.</i>&mdash;If the foundation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[623]</a></span>
of local relations is uncreated,
it is always the same; and therefore
it will cause all such relations
to be always the same. Hence, all
distances would be equal; which is
manifestly false.</p>

<p>This difficulty arises from confounding
the absolute entity of the
thing which is the foundation of
the relation, with the formal manner
of founding the relation. The
same absolute entity may found different
relations by giving to the
terms a different relativity; for the
same absolute entity founds different
relations whenever it connects
the terms of the relation in a different
manner. Thus, when the
entity of the foundation is a generic
or a universal notion, it can
give rise to relations of a very different
degree. Taking <em>animality</em>,
for instance, as the foundation of
the relation, we may compare one
hound with another, one wolf with
another, one bird with another, or
we may compare the hound with
the wolf, the wolf with the bird,
the bird with the lion, etc.; and
we shall find as many different
relations, all grounded on the same
foundation&mdash;that is, on animality.
In fact, there will be as many
different relations of likeness as
there are different animals compared.
Now, if one general ratio
suffices to do this, on account of
its universality, which extends infinitely
in its application to concrete
things, it is plain that as
much and more can be done by
the infinite virtuality of God’s immensity,
which can be terminated
by an infinite variety of extrinsic
terminations. It is the proper attribute
of an infinite virtuality to
contain in itself the reason of the
being of infinite terms, and of
their becoming connected with
one another in infinite manners.
This is what the infinite virtuality
of divine immensity can do with
respect to ubicated terms. Such
an infinite virtuality is whole,
though not wholly, in every point
and interval of space; it is as
entire between the two nearest
molecules as between the two
remotest stars. Hence its absolute
entity, though unchangeable
itself, can have different extrinsic
terminations; and, since it founds
the relations in question inasmuch
as it has such different terminations,
consequently it can found as
many different local relations as it
can have different extrinsic terminations.
A hound and a wolf, as
we have said, inasmuch as they are
animals, are alike; and the wolf
and the bird, also, inasmuch as
they are animals, are alike; but
the likeness in the second case is
not the same as in the first, because
the animality, which is one
in the abstract, is different in the
concrete terms to which it is applied.
Hence the difference, or
entitative distance, so to say, between
the wolf and the hound is
less than the entitative distance between
the wolf and the bird, although
the ground of the comparison
is one and the same. In
a like manner, the distance from
a molecule to a neighboring molecule
is less than the distance from
a star to another star, although the
ground of the relation be one and
the same; with this difference, however,
that in the case of the animals
above mentioned the relation
has an intrinsic foundation, because
“animality” is intrinsic to
the terms compared; whilst in the
case of local distances the relation
has an extrinsic foundation;
for the ubications compared are
nothing but extrinsic terms of
space.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[624]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Third difficulty.</i>&mdash;Distances evidently
intercept portions of space,
and differ from one another according
as they intercept more or
less of it. But, if space is the virtuality
of divine immensity, such
portions cannot be admitted; for
the virtuality of divine immensity
cannot be divided into parts distinct
from one another.</p>

<p>This difficulty arises from the
confusion of that which belongs
to space intrinsically, with that
which belongs to it by extrinsic
denomination only. Space in itself
has no parts; and therefore
distance cannot intercept a portion
of the entity of space. Nevertheless,
parts are attributed to
space by extrinsic denomination,
that is, inasmuch as the movements,
which space makes possible
between given terms, do not
extend beyond those terms, while
other movements are possible outside
of the given terms. Hence,
since space is infinite and affords
room for an infinite length of
movement in all directions, the
space which corresponds to a
limited movement has been called
an interval of space and a portion
of space. But this denomination
is extrinsic, and does not imply
that space has portions, or that
the entity of space is divisible.
That such a denomination is extrinsic,
there can be no doubt, for
it is taken from the consideration
of the limited movement possible
between the terms of the distance,
as all distances are known and estimated
by movement. Indeed, we
are wont to say that “movement
measures space,” which expression
seems to justify the conclusion that
the space measured is a finite portion
of infinite space; but, though
the expression is much used (from
want of a better one), it must not
be interpreted in a material sense.
Its real meaning is simply that
movement “measures the length
of the distance” in space, or that
movement “measures its own extent”
in space&mdash;that is, the length
or the extent, not of space, but
of what space causes to be extrinsically
possible between two extrinsic
terms.</p>

<p>This will be still more manifest
by referring to the evident truth
already established, that all ubications
as compared with the entity
of space are unchangeable, because
the thing ubicated cannot have two
modes of being in the infinite expanse
of space, but, wherever it be,
is always, so to say, in the centre
of it. This proves that the movement
of a point between the terms
of a given distance measures nothing
else than <em>its own length</em> in
space; for, had it to measure <em>space
itself</em>, it would have to take successively
different positions with regard
to it, which we know to be
impossible. We must therefore
conclude that distance does not
properly intercept space, though it
determines the relative length of a
line which can be drawn by a point
moving through space; for this line
is not a line of space, but a line of
movement. In other words, distance
is not the limit of the space
said to be intercepted, but of the
movement possible between the distant
terms.</p>

<p>As this answer may not satisfy
our imagination as much as it does
our intellect, and as our habit of
expressing things as they are represented
in our imagination makes it
difficult to speak correctly of what
transcends the reach of this lower
faculty, we will make use of a comparison
which, in our opinion, by
putting the intelligible in contact
with the sensible, will not fail to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[625]</a></span>
help us fully to realize the truth of
what has been hitherto said.</p>

<p>Let God create a man, a horse,
and a tree. The difference, or, as we
will call it, the entitative distance,
between the man and the horse is
less than between the man and the
tree, as is evident. Yet the man,
the horse, and the tree are extrinsic
terms of <em>the same</em> divine omnipotence,
which neither is divisible
nor admits of more or less. Now,
can we say that, because the man
is entitatively more distant from the
tree than from the horse, there
must be <em>more of divine omnipotence</em>
between the man and the tree than
between the man and the horse?
It would be folly to say so. The
only consequence which can be deduced
from the greater entitative
distance of the man and of the tree,
is, that a greater multitude of creatures
(extrinsic terms of divine omnipotence)
is possible between the
man and the tree, than between the
man and the horse. The reader
will readily see how the comparison
applies to our subject; for the
two cases are quite similar. Can
we say, then, that, because two
points in space are more distant
than two other points, there must
be <em>more of divine immensity</em>, or of its
virtuality, between the former than
between the latter? By no means.
The only consequence which can
be deduced from the greater distance
of the two former points is,
that a greater multitude of ubications
(extrinsic terms of immensity) is
possible between them, than between
the two others. This greater multitude
of possible ubications constitutes
the possibility of a greater
length of movement; and shows
the truth of what we have maintained,
viz., that distance endues the
aspect of quantity through the consideration
of the greater or less extent
of the movement possible between
its terms, and not through a
greater or less “portion” of space
intercepted.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>The difficulty is thus fully answered.
Nevertheless, as to the phrases,
“a portion of space,” “an interval
of space,” “space measured by
movement,” and a few others of a
like nature, we readily admit that
their use, having become so common
in the popular language, we
cannot avoid them without exposing
ourselves to the charge of affectation,
nay, we must use them, as
we frequently do, in order to be
better understood. But we should
remember that the common language
has a kernel as well as a
shell, and that, when we have to
determine the essential notions and
the intelligible relations of things,
we must break the shell that we
may reach the kernel.</p>

<p><i>Fourth difficulty.</i>&mdash;The notions of
space and of ubication above given
imply a sort of vicious circle. For
space is explained by the possibility
of ubications, whilst ubications are
said to be modes of being in space.
Therefore neither space nor ubication
is sufficiently defined.</p>

<p>We answer, that then only is a
sort of vicious circle committed in
defining or explaining things, when
an unknown entity is defined or explained
by means of another equally
unknown. When, on the contrary,
we explain the common notions of
such things as are immediately
known and understood before any
definition or explanation of them is
given, there is no danger of a vicious
circle. In such a case, things
are sufficiently explained if our
definition or description of them
agrees with the notion we have acquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[626]</a></span>
of them by immediate apprehension.
We say that <em>Being</em> is
that <em>which is</em>, and we explain the
extension of time by referring to
movement, while we also explain
movement by referring to time and
velocity, and again we explain velocity
by referring to the extension of
time and movement. This is no
vicious circle; for every one knows
these entities before hearing their
formal definition. Now, the same
is true with respect to space and
ubication; for the notion of space
is intuitive, and before we hear its
philosophical definition, we know
already that it is the region of all
possible ubications and movements.</p>

<p>Moreover, such things as have a
mutual connection, or as connote
one another, can be explained and
defined by one another without a
vicious circle. Thus we say that a
<em>father</em> is one who has a <em>son</em>, and a
<em>son</em> is one who has a <em>father</em>. In the
same manner we define <em>the matter</em>
as the essential term of a form, and
<em>the form</em> as the essential act of the
matter. Accordingly, since ubications
are extrinsic terms of absolute
space, and space is the formal reason
of their extrinsic possibility, it
is plain that we can, without any
fear of a vicious circle, define and
explain the former by the latter, and
<i lang="la">vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>Finally, no philosopher has ever
defined space or explained it otherwise
than by reference to possible
or actual ubications, nor was ubication
ever described otherwise than
as a mode of being in absolute or
in relative space. This shows that
it is in the very nature of things
that the one should be explained
by reference to the other. Hence
it is that even our own definition
of absolute space, which does not
explicitly refer to contingent ubications,
refers to them implicitly.
For when we say that “absolute
space is the virtuality, or extrinsic
terminability, of divine immensity,”
we implicitly affirm the possibility
of extrinsic terms, viz., of ubications.</p>

<p>And here we will end our discussion
on the entity of relative space;
for we do not think that there are
other difficulties worthy of a special
solution. We have seen that relative
space is entitatively identical
with absolute space, since it does
not differ from it by any intrinsic
reality, but only by an extrinsic denomination.
We have shown that
space is relative in an active, not
in a passive sense, that is, as the
formal reason, not as a result of
extrinsic relations. We have also
seen that these extrinsic relations
are usually called “relative spaces,”
and that this phrase should not be
used in philosophy without some
restrictive epithet, as it is calculated
to mislead.</p>

<p>Let us conclude with a remark
on the known division of space
into <em>real</em> and <em>imaginary</em>. This division
cannot regard the entity of
space, which is unquestionably
real. It regards the reality or unreality
of the extrinsic terms conceived
as having a relation in space.
The true notion of real, as contrasted
with imaginary space, is the
following: Space is called <em>real</em>,
when it is <em>really</em> relative, viz., when
it is extrinsically terminated by <em>real</em>
terms, between which it founds a
<em>real</em> relation; on the contrary, it is
called <em>imaginary</em>, when the extrinsic
terms do not exist in nature, but
only in our imagination; for, in
such a case, space is not really terminated,
and does not found real
relations, but both the terminations
and the relations are simply a fiction
of our imagination. Thus it
appears that void space, as containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[627]</a></span>
none but imaginary relations,
may justly be called “imaginary,”
though in an absolute sense
it is intrinsically real.</p>

<p>Hence we infer that the <em>indefinite</em>
space, which we imagine, when we
carry our thoughts beyond the
limits of the material world, and
which philosophers have called
“imaginary,” is not absolute, but
relative space, and is not imaginary
in itself, but only as to its denomination
of relative, because where real
terms do not exist there are only
imaginary relations, notwithstanding
the reality of the entity through
which we refer the imaginary terms
to one another.</p>

<p>That absolute space, considered
in itself, cannot be called “imaginary”
is evident, because absolute
space is not an object of imagination.
Imagination cannot conceive
space except in connection with
imaginary terms so related as to
offer the image of sensible dimensions.
It is, therefore, a blunder
to confound imaginary and indefinite
space with absolute and infinite
space. Indeed, our intellectual
conception of absolute and infinite
space is always accompanied in our
minds by a representation of indefinite
space; but this depends on the
well-known connection of our imaginative
and intellectual operations:
<i lang="la">Proprium est hominis intelligere cum
phantasmate</i>; and we must be careful
not to attribute to the object
what has the reason of its being in
the natural condition of the subject.
It was by this confusion of
the objective notion of space with
our subjective manner of imagining
it, that Kant formed his false theory
of subjective space. He mistook,
as we have already remarked, with
Balmes, the product of imagination
for a conception of the intellect,
and confounded his phantasma of
the indefinite with the objectivity
of the infinite. It was owing to
this same confusion that other philosophers
made the reality of space
dependent on real occupation, and
denied the reality of vacuum. In
vacuum, of course, they could find
no real terms and no real relations,
but they could <em>imagine</em> terms and
relations. Hence they concluded
that, since vacuum supplied nothing
but imaginary relations, void
space was an imaginary, not a real,
entity. This was a paralogism;
for the reason why those relations
are imaginary is not the lack of
real entity in absolute space, but
the absence of the real terms to
which absolute space has to impart
relativity that the relation
may ensue. It was not superfluous,
then, to warn our readers, as
we did in our introduction to this
article, against the incursions of
imagination upon our intellectual
field.</p>

<h3>A FRAGMENT.</h3>

<p class="noindent"><i>David Ben-Aser to his friend, Amri
Ephraim, health, love, and greeting</i>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Best Friend</span>: A month
past I would have marvelled greatly
that the fame of one seemingly
so obscure as he who calls himself
Jesus of Nazareth&mdash;and what good
can come out of Nazareth?&mdash;could
have travelled to Rome or Damascus.</p>

<p>But the inquiry in thy friendly
epistle from the banks of the Tiber,
brought me to-day by thy faithful
Isaac, assures me that the city of
the Emperor has caught wind of
the rumors with which Jerusalem
is filled, and ’tis but an hour since
Yusef, a Damascene merchant,
questioned me with interest concerning
this new teacher, whose
wonderful doctrines and still more
wonderful deeds have set all Galilee
in a flame.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, it has been
my fortune of late to have met him,
not once only, but several times,
and always under striking circumstances.
What seemed less likely
when we parted than that I should
give more than idle thought to
what we both deemed a sensation
of the hour; and yet it has come to
pass that this prophet, teacher&mdash;what
you will, so that it be kindly&mdash;has
occupied my reflections for
many moments in many days.
Things have so fallen out from a
small beginning that I am bidden
to dine to-morrow at the house of
Simon the Pharisee, in the company
of Jesus.</p>

<p>At the present writing, I can
gratify thy curiosity to a certain
important and strange extent; but
after having had opportunity to
converse with him, I hope to be
able still further to enlighten thee,
as well as satisfy myself as to the
nature and depth of the impression
this strange teacher has made on
thy hitherto reserved and unsusceptible
friend. I saw him first about
a fortnight past.</p>

<p>On my way to the house of
Marcus the centurion, with whom I
had a money transaction, my attention
was attracted by a motley
crowd of men, women, and children,
all eager to press closer to what
seemed to be some prominent figure
in their midst.</p>

<p>“What is the cause of this commotion,”
I inquired, “and whither
are ye bound?”</p>

<p>One of the number made answer
thus: “We follow Jesus of Nazareth,
who has been sent for by
Marcus the centurion, to heal his
servant, now lying at the point of
death.”</p>

<p>“Which is Jesus?” I asked
“and is he also a physician?”</p>

<p>“That is he with the grave face
and gentle eyes, and he is not a
physician, but a worker of miracles.”</p>

<p>Anxious to obtain a nearer view
of him whose name is in every
mouth, I endeavored to force my
way through the crowd, when a
man running at full speed and making
wild gestures with his hands
called on the multitude to part
and give him speech with Jesus,
which they did, as soon as they
fully understood his meaning and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[629]</a></span>
from whence he came. Then he
called out, saying: “Lord, my master
saith, Trouble not thyself, for I
am not worthy that thou shouldst
enter under my roof; say but the
word, and my servant shall be
healed.” Jesus lifted his head, and
I saw his face for the first time;
nay, but that part which extends
from the top of the forehead beneath
the eyes. But what eyes&mdash;how
full of life, and holiness, and
truth! And methought they fixed
their piercing glance full upon me
as he cried aloud: “I say unto
you, I have not found so great faith
in Israel.”</p>

<p>But the crowd pressed about him
and I saw him no more, for he retraced
his steps, followed by the
multitude, while I pursued my
way, filled with curiosity as to
the result. As I neared the house
of Marcus I heard sounds of
thanksgiving, and what was my
surprise to hear, and in a moment
after see, the man who had
been ill, perfectly restored, and fairly
dancing and laughing with joy.</p>

<p>Marcus is a man of probity and
considerable influence, as you well
know, and his faith in the power
of Jesus is very great, which can
hardly be counted singular.</p>

<p>Having transacted my business, I
went on my way, marvelling and
reflecting much, albeit I am not
given to running after strange
prophets, nor to walk in new
paths. But once lighted upon, it
seemed this untrodden way was to
open out fresh scenes to my view.</p>

<p>The next day I betook my steps
early to Nain, where my brother-in-law,
Jonah, lies sick of the fever,
which is now making fearful
ravages in that city. Returning
in the cool of the evening, I suddenly
encountered a funeral procession.
A woman deeply veiled
followed the corpse, piercing the
air with heartrending cries. At
the same moment a group of travel-stained
men entered the gate
of the town. In their leader I recognized
Jesus of Nazareth, and at
his approach an indefinable feeling
possessed me. I cannot describe
it save in saying that I would fain
have fallen at his feet, as though
in the presence of some superior
being.</p>

<p>“Whom do you carry?” inquired
one of the travellers.</p>

<p>“The only son of his mother,
and she is a widow,” was the sad
response.</p>

<p>Jesus touched the bier, and the
bearers paused. Turning with a
look of ineffable compassion to the
heartbroken mother, he said, in
tones gentle as those of a woman,
“Weep not.” Then, in a louder
voice, “Young man, I say to thee,
Arise.”</p>

<p>My breath came thick and fast,
the cold dews gathered on my forehead,
for, miracle of miracles: the
dead arose, cast aside his grave-clothes,
and fell sobbing upon his
joyful mother’s breast. This I
beheld with my eyes&mdash;I heard him
speak, I saw his happy tears. But
Jesus calmly gathered up his robe
and pursued his journey, and once
again I fancied&mdash;or did I fancy?&mdash;that
he singled me out from the
crowd, and fixed his eyes on mine
with an expression that was almost
an appeal. My eager gaze followed
him till I could no longer catch
the outline of his garments; after
which, I slowly returned to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>There is much talk in the city
concerning this last great miracle,
and I have been at pains to learn
more of Jesus, of whom it is even said
that he calls himself the Messiah.
It is argued against him that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[630]</a></span>
consorts with publicans and sinners,
and that his most intimate
friends and disciples are illiterate
fishermen.</p>

<p>However, he preaches that he
came not to call the just, but sinners,
to repentance; it is therefore
but natural and consistent that he
should seek out such, if his mission
lies among them; and, with regard
to his near friends being illiterate,
he is himself only a carpenter’s
son.</p>

<p>Again, his enemies say that he
casts out devils and works prodigies
through Beelzebub. But he preaches
charity, good-will, hatred of
hypocrisy and double-dealing, and
surely these are not the weapons
of the prince of darkness.</p>

<p>Many of the Pharisees, far wiser
than I, are disturbed and thoughtful
because of these marvels that
are daily occurring, so be not
alarmed, nor fear that your David
is losing his wits.</p>

<p>Three days ago, on my way from
the synagogue, I was joined by Simon,
to whom Jesus is well known,
and in the conversation which ensued
between us, our friend hospitably
invited me to dine with him at
his house this evening, saying that
Jesus would be of the company.
Of course I assented, and am all
impatience for the hour to arrive.
Simon’s recognition of Jesus speaks
well for both, the former being a
shrewd and careful man, a quick
observer, and not slow to detect
imposture; and if the qualities of
the latter were not sound and commendable,
Simon would not thus
honor him with his hospitality.</p>

<p>But already the sun dips low in
the heavens; till to-morrow, my
Ephraim&mdash;farewell.</p>

<p class="break">I left you last evening aglow with
curiosity to see and hear more of
the prophet of Israel, who is agitating
all Jerusalem with the fame of
his miracles. I return to you awestruck,
fascinated, filled with the
spirit of reverence and admiration.
What I have to say may lose much
of its impressiveness by reason of
distance and want of actual participation
in the events which have
taken place. But you cannot fail
to be touched by the strangeness
and sublimity of the soul embodied
in the form of Jesus. Yet you have
not seen him, you have not heard
the sublime language that falls from
his lips whenever he opens them
to speak, you have not felt his god-like
eye penetrating yours, nor seen
his rare and wondrous smile.
Therefore, should you scorn my
enthusiasm, I shall not blame you,
but abide the time when Jerusalem
may claim you once more. For
the rest, I do not doubt that in this,
as in all things else, we two shall be
one. But I must hasten to resume
my narrative while the events of the
past few hours are still fresh in my
memory.</p>

<p>The sun had gone down behind
a huge bank of crimson clouds,
portending a storm, as is not unusual
at this wintry season, when we
seated ourselves, to the number of
twenty or thereabouts, at the well-spread
table of Simon the Pharisee.
Jesus was already present when I
arrived, and sat, the honored guest,
at the right hand of the host, while
several of his friends or disciples
surrounded him in the semicircle
formed by the curve of the table.
Was I mistaken, or did his eyes rest
on me, as I entered, with that half-sad,
half-affectionate expression so
like an invitation? Remembering
the interest I had manifested in
our conversation concerning him,
Simon kindly placed me as near
Jesus as could well be, owing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[631]</a></span>
proximity of several older guests,
but after the first moment of greeting
Jesus resumed his discourse,
and I had ample opportunity for
observing him at my leisure. He
wore a single garment of woollen
stuff, which fell in graceful folds to
his feet, being confined at the waist
by a thick cord. The robe was
of soft but coarse material, and,
though considerably worn, appeared
quite free from soil or travel-stain.
He sat with hands loosely
folded on his knees, and I noticed
the peculiar whiteness and transparency
of the fingers, which were
long and thin. Those hands do
not look as though they belonged
to a carpenter’s son. His forehead
is high and broad, and the hair,
tinged with auburn, falls in graceful
waves about half-way to the
shoulders. The face is oval, each
feature perfect, the eyebrows delicately
pencilled, the nose of a Grecian
rather than our native Hebrew
type, the lips not very full, but firm
and red. Beard the color of his
hair, and slightly cleft, shows the
well-formed chin, and barely sweeps
his breast. But those eyes&mdash;those
deep, unfathomable, crystal wells&mdash;how
can I speak of their many and
varied expressions, of that changeful
hue between gray and brown
so beautiful and yet so rare. They
seem to unite in themselves all of
majesty and sweetness I have ever
dreamed looked forth from eyes of
angels&mdash;dignity and lowliness, severity
and tenderness, sadness and
something higher than joy. But
their prevailing expression is one
of sorrow, as though they had looked
out into the world, and, taking
in its untold miseries and sins at
one deep glance, must hold the
mournful picture there for evermore.
Indeed, it is said, I know not how
truly, that Jesus has never been
known to laugh. His voice is low
and soft, but very clear. I fancy it
would be most melodious in our
Hebrew chants. And yet it can
grow strong and loud in reproach,
as you shall presently hear.</p>

<p>The feast had begun, and the
servants were busy attending to
the wants of the guests, when a
slight noise was heard in the antechamber,
as though the porter were
remonstrating with some one who
desired to enter. Suddenly a woman
appeared on the threshold,
clothed in a fleecy white tunic,
girdled with blue, and bearing an
alabaster box in her hand. A
murmur went round the assembly.
Surely our eyes did not
deceive us&mdash;it was the notorious
courtesan, Mary Magdalen, but divested
of the costly robes and ornaments
which were formerly her
pride, and with her rich golden
hair loosely coiled at the back of
her head and simply fastened with
a silver comb.</p>

<p>I bethought me of a rumor I
had heard, that Jesus had once
delivered her from the hands of
those who were about to stone
her, and also that since that time
she had renounced her abandoned
manner of life. Pale, with
eyes downcast, she stood one
hesitating instant in the doorway;
then, falling on her knees
before Jesus, she wept aloud,
literally bathing his feet with her
tears. He uttered no word of
reproach, but suffered her to unbind
that beautiful hair whose
golden threads had lured so
many to destruction. Now, as
though seeking to make atonement,
she wiped with it his tired
feet. Kissing them humbly, and
still weeping, she drew from the
alabaster box most precious ointment
and anointed them profusely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[632]</a></span>
All were silent, but many
shook their heads with doubt and
suspicion. Simon the Pharisee
folded his arms, but spake not,
till Jesus, as though divining the
thoughts of his heart, said slowly
and impressively:</p>

<p>“Simon, I have somewhat to say
unto thee.”</p>

<p>And he answered him: “Master,
say on.”</p>

<p>Then he said: “There was a
certain creditor who had two
debtors: the one owed five hundred
pence, and the other fifty.
And when they had nothing to
pay, he frankly forgave them both.
Tell me, therefore, which of them
will love him most?”</p>

<p>Simon answered and said: “I
suppose he to whom he forgave
most.”</p>

<p>And he said unto him: “Thou
hast rightly judged.” And he turned
to the woman, and said unto
Simon: “Seest thou this woman?
I entered into thine house,
thou gavest me no water for my
feet; but she hath washed my feet
with tears, and wiped them with
the hairs of her head. Thou
gavest me no kiss; but this woman,
from the time I came in, hath not
ceased to kiss my feet. My head
with oil thou didst not anoint, but
this woman hath anointed my feet
with ointment. Wherefore, I say
unto thee, her sins, which are many,
are forgiven, for she hath loved
much; but to whom little is forgiven,
the same loveth little.”
And he said unto her: “Thy sins
are forgiven.”</p>

<p>No one made answer as the woman
silently departed, but the incident
had strangely disturbed the
spirit of the feast. I marvel how
the most critical could have found
fault or misjudged what was undoubtedly
a spontaneous expression
of gratitude and contrition in the repentant
sinner. Jesus had saved
Mary from death, and humbled her
accusers with these remarkable
words: “Let he who is without sin
among you throw the first stone.”
They slunk away mortified and
abashed.</p>

<p>Since that time she has seen the
error of her ways, and surely, if the
God of our fathers pardons sinners,
it is but in keeping with his established
character for justice and mercy
that so perfect a man as Jesus
should not rebuke them. I am
more and more powerfully drawn
towards this wonderful teacher.
As the guests dispersed last evening,
I contrived to obtain speech
with him, and he replied to several
questions of mine with great mildness
and suavity. And although,
by reason of my known wealth and
position among the Pharisees, one
might suppose he would make some
note of the voluntary admiration
and respect I did not hesitate to
manifest, he soon turned with grave
dignity to others who surrounded
him, his own friends no doubt, and
seemed to forget my presence. They
say he goes to-morrow into various
towns and villages, for the purpose
of preaching and instructing. He
will be accompanied by the twelve
who always follow him. My interest
has been so strongly excited
that I am tempted to defer still
longer my journey to Rome, which
I had intended to begin almost immediately.
However, I shall not
postpone it sufficiently long to deprive
myself of the pleasure of thy
company in the capital for some
time previous to thy return to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>In any event, I shall write thee
soon. Blessings upon thee, dearest
friend! I await an answer to this
lengthy epistle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[633]</a></span></p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>The fury of the first persecution
had nearly exhausted itself, and
even Nero, that insatiable butcher
whose thirst for blood had enkindled
the fierce flame, seemed to
have well-nigh spent the measure
of his inhuman cruelty.</p>

<p>Hiding like criminals in gloomy
abodes and obscure retreats, those
Christians who had escaped martyrdom
seldom ventured forth save
when the dusk of evening rendered
them less liable to scrutiny or interrogation.</p>

<p>But among the exceptions to this
precautionary rule was one, that of
a very old, white-haired man, who
might be seen at all times in the
most public places, and who was
well-known to be a fearless and devoted
Christian. Indeed, he seemed
rather to court danger than
avoid it, and it was a marvel to the
more timid among his brethren how
he had thus far escaped the lion’s
jaws or the caldron of boiling oil.</p>

<p>One raw evening in early March,
three drunken soldiers were tumbling
along a narrow Roman street,
lined with small, obscure-looking
houses, when a bent figure suddenly
issued from one of the low doorways
and walked hurriedly in the
direction of the Jews’ quarter, not
far distant.</p>

<p>“Ho there!” called one of the
three, eager for adventure of any
kind, “ho there! Who art thou,
and whither goest thou?”</p>

<p>The figure paused, and said in reply,
“I am an old man, and I go to
relieve a fellow-man in distress.”</p>

<p>“Not so fast, not so fast, friend,”
retorted the soldier. “In these
times, we guardians of the emperor’s
peace must be circumspect and vigilant.”</p>

<p>“Ho, ho! It is Andrew, that
dog of a Christian who boasteth, I
am told, that he is not afraid of our
august emperor himself,” said another
of the three. “Speak, old
man; art thou not a Christian, and
brave enough to face thy master,
who can, if he so pleases, make a
torch of thee to light belated way-farers
home?”</p>

<p>“Ay, thou sayest truly, I am a
Christian,” replied the old man,
folding his arms and standing erect,
as he continued: “My name is
Andrew; I am well known in the
city, and acknowledge no master in
the odious tyrant who calls himself
Emperor of Rome.”</p>

<p>“Ah! what is this?” said the soldier
who had not yet spoken, and
who appeared the most sober of the
three. “So&mdash;so. A traitor and a
Christian. There is a double reward
set upon thy head, old fellow.
Comrades, we would be doing an
injustice to the emperor and the
state in not apprehending this
venomous traitor. Let us away
with him to prison, and before this
time to-morrow he may know what
it is to feel the emperor’s avenging
arm.” The old man’s eye brightened,
and he would have spoken, but
was prevented by him who had first
accosted him.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, comrades,” he said,
“let the poor creature go. He has
been seen in all public places since
the edict, and is well known for a
Christian. Yet his age and infirmities
have thus far saved him from
arrest. Let us to our quarters, and
permit him to go free.”</p>

<p>“Not so,” replied his companion
gruffly, while the other seized the
old man by the cloak. “It won’t
do to make fish of one and flesh of
another. Besides, there’s the booty,
and that’s something not to be despised.”</p>

<p>“Well, so be it,” was the reply;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[634]</a></span>
“one against two is but poor odds.
Let us go.”</p>

<p>The prisoner made no resistance,
walking on silently between his
captors, but a strange light shone
in his eyes; and when the great
iron door of the cell into which he
was rudely hurried closed behind
him, he fell on his knees exclaiming:</p>

<p>“At last, my God, at last! O
Lord! I thank thee&mdash;let not this
great joy pass from me.”</p>

<p>Morning dawned, and Nero sat
dispensing death and torture to the
doomed Christians, inventing new
cruelties with each death sentence.
An old man, heavily manacled, was
led in by three guards. His venerable
appearance attracted the
emperor’s notice, and he cried
out:</p>

<p>“Ho, guards! bring forward
the patriarch. What offence hath
the old Jew committed? Has he
been pursuing some unlucky creditor,
or hath his last enterprise savored
too strongly of usury? What
is charged against thee, Jew?”</p>

<p>“He is no Jew, but a bragging
Christian, most noble emperor,”
exclaimed the foremost guard.
“He boasted but last night that he
would not acknowledge thee for
master, and we have brought him
to thy presence that his boast may
wither beneath the light of thy august
countenance.”</p>

<p>“Art thou not a Jew?” cried
Nero, as the prisoner lifted his bowed
head, and stood erect.</p>

<p>“I am a Jew by birth, but a
Christian by religion,” he replied in
a low but audible voice.</p>

<p>“What is thy name?”</p>

<p>“I was baptized Andrew, and so
I am called.”</p>

<p>Here a murmur ran through the
crowd, and a centurion stepped
forward, saying:</p>

<p>“A most bitter enemy of the
gods, most noble emperor. He is
the same who may be seen at all
the public executions of Christians,
exhorting and praying with them.”</p>

<p>“I wonder he has never been
apprehended until now&mdash;it speaks
well for the devotion of my adherents,”
replied the emperor with a
sneer. The centurion drew back
somewhat abashed.</p>

<p>“I have often sought death, but
my gray hairs have spared me
until now,” said the old man.</p>

<p>“Hold thy treacherous tongue,
sirrah,” cried one of the guards.
“I’ll warrant thee they will not
spare thee now.”</p>

<p>“Silence!” cried the emperor.
“Old man, art thou the same of
whom it is said thou wert a friend
of the Galilean ere he went to the
gibbet?”</p>

<p>“What I was it matters not.
What I desire to be is the faithful
servant of my Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p>“Verily, thou art impertinent,
and age hath not taught thee humility.
Mayhap, it would please
thee to have thy old body cut in
slices and thrown to the wild
beasts.”</p>

<p>“It would be the fulfilment of
my most ardent prayers&mdash;any death
by which I might suffer martyrdom
for Jesus Christ. I have longed
for it these fifty years.” As he spoke
his face seemed transfigured, while
that of Nero assumed a new and
more malicious expression.</p>

<p>“How old art thou?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I am ninety-two.”</p>

<p>“Where is thy birthplace?”</p>

<p>“Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>“And thou wouldst die for Jesus
Christ?”</p>

<p>“Thou knowest it, my judge.”</p>

<p>“Such death would be the greatest
boon thy heart desires?”</p>

<p>“My God knoweth it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[635]</a></span></p>

<p>A mocking smile played around
the emperor’s lips as he said:</p>

<p>“Then hear thy sentence. Thou
shalt be taken from hence to the
Appian gate&mdash;and there bidden go
thy way in peace. Thou art not
young enough to be toothsome to
the lions, and the sap is so dried
in thy veins thou wouldst make
but a sorry torch by night. There
is so little flesh upon thy bones that
thou wouldst not sink in Tiber,
and we cannot afford to waste
stones in weighting such as thou.
Thy withered carcass would not
whet the executioner’s knife; there
is naught for it but to let thee go.
Spend the remainder of thy days
as thou hast wasted those that are
gone, in longings for martyrdom.
Guards! seize your prisoner, and
execute sentence upon him.”</p>

<p>The light that had illumined the
eyes of the old man slowly faded
as the emperor spoke, and great
tears rolled down his furrowed
cheeks. Clasping his withered
hands high above his head, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“It is not to be&mdash;it is not to be!
My God, I accept the retribution.”</p>

<p>“What sayest thou?” cried
Nero. “Hast thou committed some
terrible crime that thou talkest of
retribution?”</p>

<p>“Ay, a great crime; but I have
suffered much, and striven to make
atonement. But my Saviour is not
yet satisfied.”</p>

<p>“Accuse thyself. We may be
less lenient here than awhile ago.”</p>

<p>The old man’s eyes kindled once
more and again he stood erect:
“Yes, I will confess,” he cried in a
loud voice. “I will let all the world
know that he whom his companions
have called just is the meanest sinner
of them all; I will strive by
the whiteness of my gray hairs and
the years of sorrow that have passed
since that mad day to awaken
in thy tyrant heart some pity, some
relenting from thy cruel sentence.</p>

<p>“But alas! what do I say? The
hand of God is in it&mdash;my Saviour
refuses me the boon I crave, and
thou art but his instrument.” He
sighed heavily, wiped the tears
from his eyes, and continued in a
less agitated voice:</p>

<p>“I am a native of Jerusalem&mdash;a
descendant of the tribe of Aser;
my father was a ruler of much
wealth and influence&mdash;both of
which I inherited. I had luxurious
tastes, and gratified them to a
certain extent, filling my house
with rare and costly furniture and
ornaments. I travelled much, and
indulged my inclinations to the
fullest extent without transgressing
the moral law. I esteemed virtue
and practised it, more from a sense
of pride than a feeling of true religion.
I was unmarried and had
few intimate friends. One, however,
Amri Ephraim, was bound to
me by the closest ties of intimacy
and association. He was also
wealthy. Business called him to
Rome about the time our Lord
Jesus began to preach the gospel in
Galilee. We were both somewhat
interested in the new prophet, as he
was then called; but from my first
meeting with him I was filled with
admiration for his teachings, and
drawn towards him by an attraction
I could not then understand.
Alas! I have known its meaning
for many sorrowful, repentant
years.</p>

<p>“His influence grew upon me.
I followed him from place to place;
he took kindly notice of me. His
gentle looks seemed to beckon me
on; his wondrous miracles became
convincing proofs of his divine
mission; his merciful and consoling
teachings entered deep into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[636]</a></span>
my soul, and left it glowing with
awe and veneration. I felt that
he was the Messiah promised by
David; I knew it in my coward
heart. And yet this world&mdash;this
glittering, hollow sham&mdash;it was that
which held me back and lured me
to my own perdition. Many times
I saw Jesus look upon me with a
gaze that told of affection mingled
with doubt and sorrow. For days
I would absent myself from his
side, only to return athirst and
filled with new desires.</p>

<p>“One day, as he sat in the shade
of a palm-tree with a few of his
disciples, I threw myself at his
feet and listened to the wisdom
that fell from his lips.</p>

<p>“‘Master,’ I said at length, ‘what
shall a man do to inherit eternal
life?’</p>

<p>“‘Keep the commandments,’ he
answered, fixing his eyes upon me
as though he would read my soul.</p>

<p>“‘I have kept them from my
youth,’ I replied.</p>

<p>“‘Then lackest thou yet one
thing,’ he said. ‘Sell all thou
hast, give thy treasure to the poor,
and come, follow me.’</p>

<p>“The words were spoken&mdash;they
had appealed to my heart for
many days; Jesus loved me, he
had singled me from the multitude
of whom but little is required&mdash;he
would have chosen me
for a familiar disciple. I saw it
in his eye; I heard it in his
voice. He had called me to follow
him! And I?…</p>

<p>“Before me there swept a vision
of lost delights and despised honors.
I saw myself hungry and
cold, and naked and scorned; I
heard the censure of the world,
the altered tones of friends, the
jibes and sneers of enemies. If
I had dared once more to lift my
eyes&mdash;if I had met that benignant
glance, so full of affection and assurance&mdash;all
would have been well,
and the craven heart had never
bled these sixty years for that one
moment’s loss. But, alas! I cast
down my eyes and bowed my
head; I arose and went away
sorrowful. That night I left
Jerusalem and fled to Rome. I
say fled, for I was like a criminal
fleeing not from a tyrant but
a kind and merciful father. My
friend, to whom I had written faithfully
of my interest in Jesus, passed
and missed me on the way to
Jerusalem.…”</p>

<p>Here the old man’s voice faltered
and his frame shook with sobs.
He seemed unconscious of all but
his own sorrow as he continued:</p>

<p>“He learned to know Jesus&mdash;became
a faithful disciple; he witnessed
his capture and cruel trial;
he followed him to Calvary; he
saw the prodigies that occurred at
his death; he saw him ascend into
heaven. He enjoyed the sweet
privilege of conversing with Mary;
he received the dead body of
Stephen the blessed martyr, and
helped to give it decent burial,
and his body lies to-day at the
bottom of old Tiber&mdash;martyred
for the faith of Christ; while I&mdash;coward
that I was&mdash;awoke to the
sense of my sin when it was too
late to return and throw myself at
his sacred feet, too late to touch
the hem of his garment, too late
to follow his bloody footsteps up
the frightful Mount of Calvary.
One expiation I thought to make&mdash;one
atonement for my sin; for
the poor sacrifice of my wealth
was nothing to me. I sought
martyrdom. In the public places,
in the forum, by the side of
dying Christians, at the graves
of murdered saints. But I seemed
to bear a charmed life. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[637]</a></span>
passed me by, they did not molest
me. He is harmless, said one; he
is old, said another. And now,
when I thought the goal within
my reach, when I hoped that my
expiation had been accepted, it is
again denied me. Be it so, my
God, my outraged and despised
Saviour, be it so! I rejected thee&mdash;thou
rejectest me. Thou didst
die for me&mdash;thou wilt not suffer
me to die for thee. Thy will be
done!”</p>

<p>The bowed head fell heavily on
the clasped hands, and the old man
sank slowly on his knees. At that
moment a stray sunbeam, the first
of a murky morning, touched his
white hair as with a crown of
brightness, then faded and the
clouded heavens grew dark. The
guards stooped to lift him. He
was dead.</p>

<p>“What a dramatic talent those
Christians have!” said the emperor
to his friend Apulius, who stood
beside his throne. “Pity they do
not apply it to better purpose.
Guards! let that old man go free&mdash;we
pity his gray hairs&mdash;ha! ha!”</p>

<p>“He is dead, most noble emperor,”
replied one of the soldiers,
not without something of softness
in his voice.</p>

<p>“Ah! so? Remove the corpse
then; and thou, good Marcellus, be
sure thou hast those fifty Syrian
Christian torches well pitched and
oiled ere night&mdash;for it will be dark,
and we must needs be lighted to
Phryma’s banquet. Come Apulius&mdash;make
way, lictors.”</p>

<p>So Nero passed beneath the
arched doorway from his tyrant
throne&mdash;and at the same moment
some timid Christians near its foot
bore away the body of a saint for
burial.</p>

<h3>THE ROMAN RITUAL AND ITS CHANT<br />
<i>COMPARED WITH THE WORKS OF MODERN MUSIC.</i><br />
II.&mdash;CONCLUDED.</h3>

<h4>VALUE AS A MEDIUM OR VEHICLE OF DIVINE
TRUTH AMONG THE PEOPLE.</h4>

<p>Popular national songs with
their melodies are not, either in
point of poetry or music, very elaborate
or classical works of art.
Consummate art is incapable of
passing among a people, and must
ever remain confined to the initiated
and the connoisseur; yet national
songs are not only characteristic of
all people, but fulfil a very important
function. They not only foster
and preserve the national spirit, of
which they are the expression, but
also keep up, by tradition among
the people, a knowledge of the history
of their race, and of the exploits
and noble deeds of its great
men. In a word, the songs of a
people have an influence over the
growth of their moral character
which it is not easy to overestimate,
and which was well known to
that statesman who was heard to
say that they who have the making
of a people’s songs will soon have
the making of their laws; a sentiment
fully confirmed by the proverb,
“Qui mutat cantus, mutat mores.”</p>

<p>The above remarks, much too
brief to put the importance of the
ideas contained in them in their
proper light, seem to issue in the
conclusion that the song of the
Christian kingdom will be necessarily
something very different from
an elaborate work of musical genius.</p>

<p>When our divine Redeemer lifted
up his eyes, and beheld the multitudes
going astray as sheep without a
shepherd, he was moved with compassion.
Surely in his judgment
sacred song will be deemed to fulfil
its mission when it passes current
among the people, is domesticated
in the laboring man’s cottage among
his children, and there teaches the
family the knowledge of their Saviour’s
life and sufferings, of their redemption
by these from sin, and
the death of the world to come.
Sacred song will, in his compassionate
eyes, fulfil its mission of mercy
when it takes up the words of eternal
Wisdom, and puts them in the
mouth of the people as a charm
against the maxims of a world declared
by the Word of God to be
“<em>lying in wickedness</em>,” and as a shield
against the assaults of a tempter,
said in the same Word “<em>to be ever
going about seeking whom he may devour</em>.”
It will fulfil its mission
when it enters into the heart and
soul of the people, accompanies the
departed with a requiem as man
goeth to his long home and the
mourners go about the streets, when
it administers comfort to the survivors,
while it bids them not to
sorrow as they that have no hope,
and, in a word, weeps with them
that weep, and rejoices with them
that do rejoice. Nor let it be said
that this is a romantic notion&mdash;the
making out of the earth an ideal
paradise. Surely the actual and
adequate fulfilment of such a mission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[639]</a></span>
of sacred song belongs to the
idea of the mission of the Son of
God, sent by the Father to re-establish
order, piety, and sanctity on
the earth. But what if this idea
was not only familiar to the fathers,
but that they actually saw the progress
of its accomplishment?</p>

<p>“There is no need here,” says S.
Chrysostom, exhorting his people
to take part in the church chant,
“of the artist’s skill, which requires
length of time to bring to perfection.
Let there be but a good will and a
ready mind, and the result will soon
be sufficient skill. There is no absolute
need even of time or place, for
in every place or time one may
sing with the mind. Though you
be walking in the Forum, or are on
a journey, or are seated with your
friends, the mind may be on the
alert, and find for itself an utterance.
It was thus that Moses cried,
and God heard. If you are an artisan,
you may sing Psalms as you
sit laboring in your workshop; you
may do the same if you are a soldier,
or a judge seated on his
bench” (Hom. on Ps. iv.)</p>

<p>A formal acknowledgment on the
part of the church of this principle
of teaching by means of song,
which at the same time proves its
antiquity, though it can be hardly
necessary to cite it, may be found
in one of the Collects for Holy Saturday:
“Deus, celsitudo humilium,
et fortitudo rectorum, qui per sanctum
Moysen puerum tuum ita erudire
populum tuum sacri carminis
tui decantatione voluisti, ut illa
legis iteratio fiat etiam, nostra directio,”
etc., etc.&mdash;“O God! the
loftiness of the humble and the
strength of them that are upright,
who wast pleased, through thy holy
servant Moses, to instruct thy people
by the singing of a sacred
song,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>If, then, this be a true and just
view of the mission of the sacred
song among the poor and the unlearned
multitude, as contemplated
in the divine idea; if it be true, as
I suppose no one will deny, that
the Ritual Chant is not only fitted
to accomplish it, but has realized it
in times past, and does still realize
it in countries that might be named;
and if the works of modern art
are, from their very scientific character
as music, incapable of being
the medium in which divine truth
can pass among the people; and,
indeed, if it be their nature to give
so much more of prominence to the
beauty of mere sound than to the
expression of intelligible meaning
or sentiment, which every one
knows is the case, we seem to gain
this obvious result, on drawing the
comparison, that the Ritual chant
is a <em>real medium</em> or vehicle for the
circulation of divine truth among
the people, fitted with a divine
wisdom to its end; while the great
works of art that the musician so
much admires are not, to any practical
extent whatever, such a medium,
and indeed, if the truth must
be said, were probably <em>never</em> contemplated
as such, either by those
who composed or those who now
admire them.</p>

<h4>COMPARATIVE “MEDICINAL VIRTUE.”</h4>

<p>“They that are whole need not
a physician,” said our Redeemer
(Mark ii. 17), “but they that are
sick. I came not to call the just,
but sinners to repentance.” It
was part of the mission of the Son
of God upon earth, that he should
be the physician of the souls of
men (Isaiæ lxi.): “Spiritus Domini
super me, eo quod unxerit Dominus
me, <em>ut mederer contritis</em> corde.”
It will follow, then, that the music
which the divine Physician of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[640]</a></span>
souls will desire to see employed
in his church will be strongly marked
with the medicinal character.</p>

<p>And this conclusion becomes the
more natural, from observing the
numberless indications which the
literature of different countries affords
that music has always been
popularly regarded as a medicine
for the spirit; as, for instance, the
Greek pastoral poet, Bion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">Μολπὰν ταὶ Μοῖσαι, μοὶ ἀεὶ ποθέοντι διδοῖεν</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse right"><span class="smcap">Bionis</span>, <cite>Bucolica</cite>, i.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Song than which no medicine so
sweet.” Among the Romans, the
courtly Ovid:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Hoc est cur cantet vinctus quoque compede fossor</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse right"><span class="smcap">Ovid</span>, <cite>de Tristibus</cite>, <cite>Eleg.</cite> lib. i.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And, in our own literature, the great
poet of human nature, Shakspeare:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“When griping grief the heart doth wound,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And doleful dumps the mind oppress,</div>
<div class="verse">Then music with her silver sound</div>
<div class="verse indent1">With speedy help doth lend redress.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse right"><span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>’s <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With this view of music, as permitted
by a merciful Providence to
retain a large share of healing virtue,
even apart from religion, and
in the midst of the disorders of
heathenism, expectation will be
naturally much raised on coming
to inquire what have been the
effects of the Christian music
which the divine Physician of
souls has given to his Church.
Nor will there be any disappointment.
S. Basil the Great, the
well-known doctor and bishop of
the East, speaks of the Plain Chant
of his own day in the following
terms:</p>

<p>“Psalmody is the calm of the
soul, the umpire of peace, that sets
at rest the storm and upheaving of
the thoughts. Psalmody quiets the
turbulence of the mind, tempers its
excess, is the bond of friendship,
the union of the separated, the reconciler
of those at variance; for
who can count him any longer an
enemy with whom he has but once
lifted up his voice to God? Psalmody
putteth evil spirits to flight,
calleth for the help of angels, is a
defence from terrors by night, a rest
from troubles by day, is the safety
of children, the glory of young
men, the comfort of the old, the
fairest ornament of women.…
Psalmody calls forth a tear from a
heart of stone, is the work of angels,
the government of Heaven, the
incense of the Spirit.”</p>

<p>S. Ambrose, Archbishop of Milan
in the West, in the preface to
his Commentary on the Book of
Psalms, speaks as follows:</p>

<p>“In the Book of Psalms there
is something profitable for all; it is
a sort of universal medicine and
preservative of health. Whoever
will read therein may be sure to
find the proper remedy for the diseased
passion he suffers from.
Psalmody is the blessing of the
people, a thanksgiving of the multitude,
the delight of numbers, and
a language for all. It is the voice
of the Church, the sweetly-loud
profession of faith, the full-voiced
worship of men in power, the delight
of the free, the shout of the
joyous, the exultation of the merry.
It is the soother of anger, the
chaser away of sorrow, the comforter
of grief. It is a defence by
night, an ornament by day, a shield
in danger, a strong tower of sanctity,
an image of tranquillity, a pledge
of peace and concord, forming its
unity of song, as the lyre, from
diversity of sound. The morning
echoes to the sound of psalmody,
and the evening re-echoes. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[641]</a></span>
apostle commanded women to be
silent in the church; yet the song
of psalmody becomes them (S.
Ambrose is speaking of congregational
psalmody). Boys and
young men may sing psalms without
danger, and even young women
also, without detriment to
their matronly reserve. They are
the food of childhood; and infancy
itself, that will learn nothing
besides, delights in them. Psalmody
befits the rank of the king,
may be sung by magistrates, and
chorused by the people, each one
vying with his neighbor in causing
that to be heard which is good for
all” (<cite>Præfatio in Comment in Lib.
Psalmorum</cite>).</p>

<p>S. Augustine speaks thus of the
Church Chant: “How my heart
burned within me against the
Manicheans, and how I pitied them,
that they neither knew its mystery
nor healing virtue; and that they
should insanely rage against that
very antidote by which they might
have recovered their saneness (insani
essent adversus antidotum quo
sani esse potuissent)!” (<cite>Confess.</cite>
lib. ix.) To which should certainly
be added the fact that, in some degree,
the church may be said to be
indebted to this very medicinal
power of her psalmody, and to the
tears it drew forth from the young
catechumen Augustine, for one of
the profoundest among her saints
and doctors.</p>

<p>And to come to times nearer our
own, the well-known Massillon, in
one of his charges to his clergy, delivered
at the Conference at which
he presided, earnestly recommends
them to make the study of the Plain
Chant a part of their recreation;
for, adds he, “le peuple souvent se
calme au chant du sacerdoce dans
le temple.” (<cite>Conferences</cite>, vol. iii.)
And our own times have witnessed
a remarkable instance of the same
medicinal power of the church
chant when in the Champs Élysées
of Paris, during the summer of 1848,
the citizens met in the open air, to
celebrate a Requiem Mass for the
repose of those who had fallen in
the great civil commotion of that
year, which had been suppressed
with such loss of life. Here were
to be seen the murderer and the
relations of the murdered, forgetting
that strongest and deadliest
feud of the human heart&mdash;the thirst
for vengeance for the shedding of
kindred blood&mdash;joining their own
to the thousands of voices that
poured forth the well-known church
chant of the <cite>Dies iræ</cite>. Ten thousand
voices supplicating Almighty
God to pardon the past, to grant
rest to the souls of the slain, to
bear in mind that he had come on
earth to save them, and to beg that
he would remember them in mercy
at the day of his judgment, in the
language and song of the church!
Of a truth, then, may the church
chant say, <i lang="la">Unxit me Spiritus Domini,
ut mederer contritis corde</i>.</p>

<p>It is also curious to observe in
what a marked manner, even in
the recent Protestant literature of
our own country, this medicinal
character of the church chant is
still recognized. Mr. Wordsworth
has the following lines in his <cite>Ecclesiastical
Sonnets</cite> (xxx.):</p>

<p>Henry Kirke White, in the fragment

still more remarkable testimony to
a power over evil spirits. He is
describing the death-bed of a female
who, fearing that the demons would

singers besides.”</p>

<p>And now, in drawing the comparison,
it is fair to ask, granting the
exception where it may be justly
conceded, in favor of particular
compositions: What on the whole
is the <em>medicinal virtue</em> of our modern
figured music? how does it
take effect? who are the persons
whose sorrow it relieves? who are
they who find themselves really
made better by it, and inclined,
through its influence, to feel in
greater charity with the remainder
of the congregation? To judge
from the kind of remarks that are
usually made by persons coming
away from a church where one of
these figured music Masses has
been executed, one would certainly
not say that they could be many.
For what are these remarks but
those of connoisseurs, who criticise
the merits of a voice which has
reached a very high or low note, or
of a particular solo, trio, or quartet,
to which those who are uninitiated
in the mysteries of minim
and crotchet pay positively no attention
at all? Now, let us for a
moment suppose a person to say,
with S. Ambrose, in praise of Mozart’s
famous No. XII., that it was
a “defence by night, an ornament
by day, a shield in danger, a strong
tower of sanctity, an image of tranquillity,
a pledge of peace”; or
with S. Basil, that “it had the virtue
of putting devils to flight”;
would any experience more unfeigned
surprise than those very
persons who think this Mass the
absolute ideal of church music?
Or again: if, unknown to himself
and to others, there were at this
moment a future doctor of the
church among our London club
politicians, how much would it naturally
occur to us to think that
the performance of this same No.
XII. would be likely to contribute
towards effecting his conversion?</p>

<h4>RESPECTIVE CAPACITY FOR DURABLE POPULARITY.</h4>

<p>God, who gave the Ecclesiastical
Chant as a gift of mercy to the
people, must needs contemplate
it as <em>popular</em>. For except it were
really popular, it would fail to attain
its end. This, then, will be
the place to examine what indications
are to be found that the Ritual
Chant is really, in this particular,
the fulfilment of the Divine idea.</p>

<p>When an invention or an art is
such that people come to borrow
from it popular expressions, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[643]</a></span>
when it gives birth to new phrases
or metaphors, or a word or words
come to be engrafted from it upon
one or many languages, this becomes
an argument for its popularity,
such as no one will be inclined
to dispute. Such phrases as
those of “Go ahead,” “Get the
steam up,” are quite sufficient to
prove the fact of everybody being
well acquainted with the steam-engine,
from which they are derived.
Now, if a similar fact can
be found relative to the Gregorian
chant, its popularity is in a manner
placed beyond the reach of doubt.</p>

<p>When the poet Gray uses a well-known
word in the lines,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The next, with <em>dirges</em> due, in sad array.</div>
<div class="verse">Slow through the church-yard path we saw him borne,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">he bears testimony to such a fact.
The initial word of the first Antiphon
of the Matins for the dead,
“<em>Dirige</em> gressus meos, Domine,”
has given this well-known word to
our language. It can be hardly
necessary to refer to a similar reception
of the word “Requiem”
into many different languages, which
is the initial word of the Introit in
the Mass for the dead.</p>

<p>The following anecdote, related
by Padre Martini, page 437 of the
third volume of his <cite>History of Music</cite>,
may be here to the point. It is
of Antonio Bernacchi, the most
celebrated singer of his day (the
beginning of the XVIIIth century),
and narrated to him by Bernacchi
himself: that, as he happened
to be on a journey in Tuscany,
near a monastery of Trappist
monks, he felt a desire to visit it, in
order to become acquainted with
the way of life of these religious.
He entered their church exactly at
the time they were singing Tierce.
Bernacchi was overcome by the effect
of a multitude of voices in such
perfect union that they seemed to
be only one voice. He admired
their precision in the utterance of
every syllable, and in the softening,
swelling, and sustaining of the
voice, that although no more than
men, they seemed to him like angels
occupied in praising God;
whereupon Bernacchi fell into the
following soliloquy: “How deceived
have I been in myself; I thought
that, after a long and diligent application
to the art of singing under
such a master as Pestocchi, and
having the natural gift of a good
voice, I might pretend to exercise
my profession without any question.
How have I been deceived, being
obliged to confess that the psalmody
of these religious has in it a
value and a quality that renders
their song superior to mine!”</p>

<p>Dom Martene relates that, in
his travels to visit the churches of
France, he passed by a church of
Benedictine nuns, who met with a
patron and benefactor in the following
manner: The Duc de
Bournonville retiring from Paris in
disgrace to “Provins,” on his arrival
inquired for the nearest church;
and, upon being shown the church
of these nuns, he entered it as they
were singing Vespers. So charmed
was he by the sweetness of their
song, that he seemed to himself to
be listening to angels, and not to
human creatures. On hearing, in
an interview that followed, that the
community were in debt, he gave
the lady abbess an immediate present
of one thousand ecus, and
ever afterwards continued to be a
benefactor to the convent (<cite>Voyage
Littéraire</cite>, etc., part i. p. 79).</p>

<p>Baini (<cite>Mem. Stor.</cite>, vol. ii. p. 122)
quotes a letter, which is thus addressed
to some English gentlemen
who had visited Rome: “To Mr.
Edward Grenfield, Fellow of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[644]</a></span>
Royal Academy of London, to Mr.
Davis, Mr. Morris, and other learned
Englishmen, whose ears have
not been altered by fashion, and
made obtuse by habit, and who
have been more than once heard to
say, that they felt themselves more
moved by the Gregorian Chant
than by all the noisy performances
of the greater part of our theatres.”</p>

<p>Nor is this appreciation for Gregorian
music confined merely to
persons from among the multitude.
The following are the sentiments
of two of the most distinguished
musical scholars of the day:</p>

<p>“All is worthy of admiration in
the primitive Roman Chant. The
tune of the ‘Kyrie,’ for doubles
and feasts of the first class, runs
out to some length, and is full of
beautiful passages. That of Sundays
is shorter and more simple, but
not the less full of unction. In
both the one and the other it seems
impossible to change or to suppress
a note without destroying a beautiful
idea, where all hangs so perfectly
together. With what natural, or
rather inspired genius, has not this
Kyrie, confined as it is to such
narrow limits, been conceived to
form a whole so complete” (Fetis,
<cite>Des Origines du Plain Chant, ou
Chant Ecclésiastique</cite>).</p>

<p>“Musicians may oppose and contradict
what I say as they please;
they have full liberty; but I am
not afraid to assert that the ancient
melodies of the Gregorian Chant
are inimitable. They may be copied,
adapted to other words, heaven
knows how, but to make new
ones equal to the first, that will
never be done” (Baini, <cite>Memorie
Storiche di P. Palæstrina</cite>, vol. ii. p.
81).</p>

<p>And again, describing Palæstrina
as engaged in the task of revising
the Gradual, he says: “But the Gregorian
chant claims a character
wholly its own, has a beauty and a
force proper only to itself. It is
what it is, and does not change.
But to remain ever the same, and to
be susceptible of a change contrary
to its nature, would be impossible.
In a word, it may be said that <em>heaven</em>
formed it through the early fathers,
and then fractured the mould.”</p>

<p>“Palæstrina applied himself with
the zeal of one who had deeply at
heart the majesty of divine worship.
But having completed the first part,
<cite>De Tempore</cite>, his pen fell from his
hands, and more wearied than Atlas
under the weight of the sky, he
abandoned his attempt; and nothing
was found at his death but
the incomplete manuscript.…
And thus we may see the greatest
man ever known in the art and science
of figured music <em>become less than
a mere baby</em> when he wished to lay
a <em>profane hand</em> on the fathers and
doctors of the Holy Roman Church.
…And how wise at last was he,
after having fruitlessly attempted
in so many ways to correct this
<em>divine song</em> according to human
ideas, to abandon the enterprise
for ever, and to conceal up to his
death the useless result of his labor,
which he himself acknowledged to
be unworthy of being made public”
(<cite>Mem. Stor.</cite> vol. ii. p. 123).</p>

<p>Next, as slightly illustrating its
power of pleasing even a modern
European people, and that in contrast
with the most elaborate products
of modern art; in 1846, at
the centenary Jubilee of the Feast
of Corpus Christi at Liege, Mendelssohn’s
<cite>Lauda Sion</cite> was sung at
one of the offices. Yet the general
opinion of the people who heard it
(and who, by the by, from its constant
use in processions, are well
acquainted with the old Gregorian
melody of the same sequence) was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[645]</a></span>
that it was not to be compared to
the ritual <cite>Lauda Sion</cite>. At the Metropolitan
Church of Mechlin, on
Easter Day, 1846, the students of
the great and little seminaries united
together to sing at the evening
Benediction. The pieces sung were
from Italian masters, Baini and a
second, and the third was the Gregorian
sequence, <cite>Victimæ Paschali
Laudes</cite>. One of the singers himself
told me that the people thought
nothing comparable to the old melody,
sung in simple unison.</p>

<p>The Collegiate Church of S. Gudule,
in the city of Brussels, may
also be cited as an existing proof
of the power of the old chant. Whoever
has heard the Requiem Mass
and the <cite>Te Deum</cite> sung in that church
by two hundred voices in unison,
must cease to think of the idea of
its popularity as if it were strange.</p>

<p>In the church of Notre Dame, in
Paris, the simple melody of the <cite>Stabat
Mater</cite> is sometimes sung by a
congregation of four thousand persons,
at the conclusion of the annual
retreats, with an effect that can
never be forgotten.</p>

<p>Again, as has been already said,
the Requiem Mass, which took
place in the Champs Elysées after
the terrible days of June (1848), it
was proposed that the Mass should
be sung in music; but the Republican
authorities, in conjunction with
the bishops, forbade it, and the
Plain Chant was ordered instead.
Tens of thousands joined in singing
the <cite>Dies iræ</cite>, and their voices seemed
to rend the heavens.</p>

<p>In Germany, among the melodies
that pass by tradition among
the people, are many that are derived
from the Ritual Chant of different
localities, as may be seen by
merely looking into their numerous
printed collections of these melodies.</p>

<p>The Gregorian modes, again, as
has been said, are far from being
unpopular in their nature. Many
of the Scotch and Irish melodies,
traditional among the people, belong
to neither of the modern
major nor minor modes. The
French in Egypt found many traditional
Arab melodies in the Gregorian
modes; and no doubt the
same would be found to be the
case over the whole world.</p>

<p>The chant of the Vespers is exceedingly
popular among our congregations
in England, though they
are acquainted with it only in a
form of disguise, shorn of its antiphons,
and encrusted with the deposit
of a long bandying about
from organist to organist, like
Ulysses, returning home in rags
and tatters after his many years’
wandering. Why should not the
popularity of the whole, when it
shall become known, by the kind
efforts of such as will feel a pleasure
in devoting themselves to teach
it to the poor, be believed in, upon
the augury of the known popularity
of a mutilated and tattered part?</p>

<p>This idea has long since found
a home among English Catholics.
Charles Butler, Esq., in his <cite>Memoirs
of English, Irish, and Scottish
Catholics</cite>, after reviewing the chief
Catholic composers of modern music,
says: “But, with great veneration
for the composers and performers
of these sacred strains, the
writer has no hesitation in expressing
a decided wish that the ancient
Gregorian Chant was restored to its
pristine honors.” And again:</p>

<p>“There (in the church) let that
music, and that music only, be performed,
which is at once simple
and solemn, which all can feel, and
in which most can join; let the
congregation be taught to sing it
in exact unison, and with subdued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[646]</a></span>
voices; let the accompaniment be
full and chaste; in a word, let it be
the Gregorian Chant” (vol. iv. p.
466).</p>

<p>Benedict XIV., after expressing
his own decided opinion of the
superior fitness of the Plain Chant,
accounts, by means of it, for a <em>fact</em>,
that those who think the Gregorian
Chant an unpopular one, would do
well to study. This, says he, is the
chief cause why the people are so
much more fond of the churches
of the Regulars than the Seculars.
And then he quotes a very remarkable
passage from Jacques Eveillon:
“This titillation of harmonized
music is held very cheap by
men of religious minds in comparison
with the sweetness of the Plain
Chant and simple Psalmody. And
hence it is that the people flock
so eagerly to the churches of the
monks, who, taking piety for their
guide in singing the praises of God
with a saintly moderation, after the
counsel of the Prince of Psalmists,
skilfully sing to their Lord as Lord,
and serve God as God, with the
utmost reverence” (<cite>Encyclical Letter</cite>,
p. 3).</p>

<p>The same Dom Martene who has
been quoted above, often speaks,
in the narrative of his journey, of
the different churches which he
visited, and in which he was present
at the celebration of any of
the solemn offices of the Liturgy.
The following passages are specimens
of his opinion on the comparative
merits of the Plain Chant.
Describing the Cathedral of Sens
he says: “Pour ce qui est de l’Eglise
Cathedrale, elle est grande,”
etc. “La musique en est proscrite,
on n’y chante qu’un beau Plain
Chant, qui est beaucoup plus agréable
que la musique.”&mdash;“As regards
the cathedral church, it is
large and spacious, and figured
music is banished from it. Nothing
but a beautiful Plain Chant is
sung in it, which is far more agreeable
than music” (Part i. p. 60).
Again, speaking of the Cathedral
of Vienne (Dauphinois), he says:
“L’Office s’y fait en tout temps
avec une gravité qui ne peut s’exprimer.
On en bannit entièrement
l’orgue et la musique; mais le
Plain Chant est si beau, et se
chante avec tant de mesure, qu’il
n’y a point de musique qui en approche.”&mdash;“The
divine Office is
sung there with a gravity that cannot
be surpassed. The organ and
all figured music are banished from
it; but the Plain Chant is so beautiful,
and is sung with so much
rhythm, that there is no music that
can come near to it” (Part i. p.
256).</p>

<p>Even Rousseau, in his <cite>Lexicon
Musicum</cite>, article, “Plain Chant,”
says: “It is a name that is given in
the Roman Church at this day to
the Ecclesiastical Chant. There
remains to it enough of its former
charms to be far preferable, even in
the state in which it now is (he is
speaking of the falsified French
edition of it), for the use to which
it is destined, than the effeminate
and theatrical, frothy and flat,
pieces of music which are substituted
for it in many churches, devoid
of all gravity, taste, and propriety,
without a spark of respect
for the place they dare thus to profane.”</p>

<p>Here it occurs to reply to a remark
that I have seen made, which
unless it be founded, as is not impossible,
on some very faulty version
of the Roman Chant, seems
to betray some little inexperience.
After having admitted a superiority
of the Gregorian melodies for
hymns written in the classical
metre, the writer proceeds to say:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span>
“But, on the other hand, let us
take any one of the hymns of the
church, in which, though the words
are Latin, the classical quantities
are wholly disregarded, while the
verse proceeds in the measured
beat of modern poetry, and the
lines are all in rhyme, and let us
make an effort to sing it to an unmutilated
Gregorian Chant. What
an absurd effect is the result! The
ear is distracted between two principles
of rhythm and versification.
The structure of the poetry forces
us, whether we will or no, to mark
the divisions of the song in accordance
with its beat and its rhyme;
while the unmeasured, unmarked
cadences of the music refuse to
yield any willing obedience, and
produce no melodious effect, except
at an entire sacrifice of the principles
on which they were framed.
A wretched, hybrid, unmeaning
series of sounds is the result, neither
recitative nor song, neither
classic nor rhyming, neither Gregorian
nor modern, but wholly barbarous.”</p>

<p>Now, if the writer of this passage
be here speaking of the adapting
of melodies to words for which they
were not composed, he is himself
to blame for a result of which he is
the sole cause. Dress a city alderman
in the uniform of an officer of
marines, and send him afloat on
duty, if you will, but do not lay it
to his charge if the result is neither
very civic nor very nautical. But
if the writer in question really
means his words to apply to the
melodies to which these hymns are
set in the Roman Chant-books,
he is confronted by the fact that,
among these, and they are now but
few, chiefly in the Feast of Corpus
Christi, are found the gems of Gregorian
melody. Who is there that
has heard the <cite>Ave verum</cite> and the
<cite>Adoro te</cite>, and the other hymns of S.
Thomas on the Blessed Sacrament,
sung to their original melodies,
without feeling their exquisite
rhythm and expressiveness? Again,
the Gregorian melody of the <cite>Dies
iræ</cite>, in the Requiem Mass, has Châteaubriand’s
express commendation
as among the most masterly
adaptations of music to words. Lastly,
the touching and most plaintive
melody of the <cite>Stabat Mater</cite>, which
brings tears into the eyes of all who
hear and sing it.</p>

<p>If space permitted, it would be
no very difficult task to multiply
such proofs and examples as these
of an inherent popularity, both in
the general character or effect, and
in the particular parts of the Ritual
Chant. But I think enough has
been adduced to indicate that the
popularity is one that is co-extensive
with mankind, that it finds an
echo in the human heart of every
age, nation, or state of life. Of
course, God, who gave the ecclesiastical
song to work a work of mercy
among the people, contemplates it
as capable of popularity; and I
think we have evidence that this
part of the divine idea is really fulfilled
by the Ritual chant. And,
without prejudging the result, I
would wait to see whether indications
of a similar popularity can be
found for the works of art with
which I have been engaged in comparing
it. However, I think this is
impossible; and for this reason:
Things come to be popular by being
often repeated; and suitableness
for perpetual repetition is the test
of popularity. But if I am not
mistaken, the perpetual production
of novelties, which appear and
then disappear, is a first and indeed
indispensable principle in the
mode of dealing with these works
of art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[648]</a></span></p>

<h4>SECURITY AGAINST ABUSE.</h4>

<p>All things human are certainly
liable to abuse and degeneracy, yet
all are very far from being on a
par with each other in this respect.
In all human undertakings, order,
discipline, and system are the divinely-appointed
securities against
abuse. Now, the Ritual Chant, as
all who are acquainted with it
know, is, like the ceremonial of the
church, a perfect system. It has
two large folio volumes of music,
embracing the whole annual range
of canonical offices, and a body of
rules prescribing even the minutiæ
of their celebration. On the other
hand, the modern art has no such
system, no such rules. Its use is,
in practice, altogether subject to
the dominion of individual taste.
The choir-master who likes Haydn’s
music, takes Haydn; another,
who likes Mozart, takes Mozart;
another, who takes a trip on the
continent, comes back with the
newest French, German, or Italian
novelties. I am not here insisting
on the singularly small portion of
the liturgy that is set to compositions
of modern art, but on the
entire absence of all system in the
use of the pieces themselves, on the
complete subjection of the whole
thing to individual caprice and
taste.</p>

<p>It is quite true that the Bride of
Christ is encompassed with variety
(<i lang="la">circumdata varietate</i>). But the
church is also the kingdom of the
God of order; and I apprehend
that between the <em>varietate</em> characteristic
of such a kingdom, and the
variety actually introduced into
Catholic worship by the unrestrained
dominion of individual taste in
music, there is the widest possible
difference.</p>

<p>The obvious exposure of modern
music to the easiest inroads of
every kind of abuse, in consequence
of this absence of system, has been
felt by its best-disposed advocates;
and an able writer has maintained
the notion, that the compulsory use
of the organ alone, to the exclusion
of all orchestral instruments, especially
the violin, would be an all-sufficient
safeguard. But it is not
very easy to see upon what principle
orchestral instruments are to be
excluded, when the whole thing is
built on the principle of the supremacy
of individual taste; and even
could they be excluded, it would
still remain to be seen whether the
organ itself were really the impeccable
instrument it is represented.</p>

<p>Let us hear a witness in the Established
Church, where, according
to this writer, its dominion has
been so unexceptionable. In the
<cite>Ecclesiastic</cite> for July, 1846, the following
remarks occur: “How intolerable
to such saints (Ambrose and
Gregory) would have been the attempt
to give effect, as it is called,
to the Psalms, by the organist’s
skilful management of the stops.
What would they have thought of
the mimic roll of the water-floods,
and the crash of the thunder, and
the hail rattling on the ground, the
lions roaring after their prey down
in the bass, and the birds singing
among the branches, represented
by a twittering among the small
pipes? From a heathen poet these
gentry might learn a lesson of reverence&mdash;Virgil
seems to make it a
point of natural piety not to counterfeit
the thunder of the Highest&mdash;</p>

<p>Now, it is fair to ask, if the organ
is to be the guardian of the sobriety
and gravity of modern art, who
is to keep the organ in order?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse indent1">“Quis custodiet ipsum</div>
<div class="verse">Custodem?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There were great abuses in the
use of modern art at the Council of
Trent. Yet the fathers of the council
declined altogether to forbid its
use. They tacitly allowed its continuance,
as it had come into existence,
and could not be removed
without serious evils. And with regard
to the favorable light in which
its use was viewed by some of the
bishops of that council, and by some
other men of authority who have
since spoken in its commendation,
it should be borne in mind that all
such commendation has had annexed
to it the condition, <em>provided that
such music be grave and decent, that
the meaning of the divine words be
not disguised in it, and that it possess
nothing in common with the theatre</em>
(Benedict XIV., Encyclical Letter).
Of which conditions the subsequent
history of the use of modern music
in the church is, to say the least, a
very inadequate fulfilment, as the
ensuing testimony will show.</p>

<p>Bishop Lindanus, quoted in the
same Encyclical Letter on the subject
of church music, says: “I know
that I have often been in churches
where I have listened most attentively
to learn what it was that was being
sung, without being able to understand
one single word.”</p>

<p>Salvator Rosa, the celebrated
painter of the XVIIth century,
gives the following account of the
church music of his day&mdash;the middle
of the century:</p>

<p>“An effeminate and lascivious
music is the only thing that people
at all care for. The race of musicians
eats up all before it, and princes
do not scruple to lay burdens
on their subjects to glut them according
to their desires. The
churches are made to serve as nests
for these owls. The Psalms become
blasphemies in passing through the
mouths of these wretches; and no
scandal can equal that of the Mass
and Vespers, barked, brayed, and
roared by such fellows. The air is
so filled with their bellowings that
the church resembles Noah’s ark.
At one time it is a <cite>Miserere</cite> sung to
a <i lang="fr">chaconne</i> (a sort of polka of that
day); at another, some other part
of the Office adapted to music in
the style of a farce.” (Quoted in
M. Danjou’s <cite>Revue de Musique</cite>, 3d
year, page 119.)</p>

<p>Again, Abbot Gerbert, in 1750,
complains so deeply of the degradation
of the church music of his day
as to say, in the preface to his learned
work <cite>De Musica Sacra</cite>, that the
evil had grown to so great a pitch
that, unless God in his mercy applied
the remedy, which he had
daily besought him to do, all was
over (<i lang="la">actum est</i>) with the decorum
and solemnity of the Catholic worship.</p>

<p>Yet this result ought really not
to be a matter of surprise; for how
can it be expected that the majesty
and solemnity of worship should
long survive when its music is left
to the control of individual tastes?</p>

<p>Musicians, therefore, when they
plead for modern music, must plead
for it as it exists in an ideal form
in their own minds; and the advocate
for the use of the Ritual
Chant objects to it, not as it might
be if every organist and company
of singers were other Davids and
the sons of Asaph, but for being
what he hears it to be with his own
ears wherever he goes; for being
what he knows it to have been, and
still to be, from the testimony of
writers and travellers; and, lastly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[650]</a></span>
from what he foresees it will be to
the end of time. The one has before
his mind’s eye the harmonies of
heaven and the choirs of angels,
and hopes to attain to these with
the elements of earth. A vision
of glory flits before him, and, forgetting
that the earth is peopled by
sinners, he thinks it may at once
be grasped. The other remembers
the sad reality of what it is; he
thinks of the churches in which he
has been present, where he has
heard the sounds of the theatre&mdash;the
fiddle, the horn, and the kettle-drum;
where he has heard the
song of dancing-girls rather than
of worshippers, and choruses rather
of idolaters than of men believing
in the mysteries at which they
were present.</p>

<p>And I would ask, considering the
endlessly varying caprices of the
human mind, how any thing else
except confusion and disorder is to
be expected from the principle of
the supremacy of individual taste;
and if music in the Christian
Church is to be regarded as called
to fulfil the intention of a God
of order, in what way it is expected
that this end will ever be realized,
where the safeguards of a fixed
order and system are discarded,
and individual discretion enthroned
in their stead?</p>

<h4>LAST POINT OF THE COMPARISON.</h4>

<div class="hanging">

<p><i>Catholicity of the Ecclesiastical Song, or its
Companionship of the Catholic Doctrines
over the whole Globe.</i></p>

</div>

<p>This last point of the comparison,
though far from the least
weighty, to those who will fairly
consider it, may happily be much
more shortly stated. The Prophet
Malachi predicted that, from the
rising of the sun to its setting, God’s
name should be great among the
Gentiles, and a “pure offering”
(<i lang="la">munda oblatio</i>) should be offered to
him; a prediction fulfilled by the
fact of the Christian missionaries
having carried the Holy Sacrifice
of the Mass over the globe. If,
then, there be a song which has ever
been the faithful companion of this
Holy Sacrifice, wherever it has been
conveyed; that has ever been present
with it when solemnly offered;
which has survived the passing
away of generations; has undergone
no change, but is now what
it was of old; is the same to the
priests of one nation which it is to
those of another&mdash;if such a song
there be, it will hardly be disputed
that such is an accredited and authentic
song of the Christian kingdom.
Yet such is the Ritual Chant,
which, at least in its well-known
parts, has literally overspread the
whole globe. A French traveller
in Russia, finding there the Ecclesiastical
Chant, and that the Greek
Church had preserved it equally
with the Latin, speaks of it as a
part of the “<em>Dogme Catholique</em>”&mdash;these
church traditions of song
seeming to him as great a bondage
as the church traditions of faith.
(See a very well written paper in the
<cite>Ecclesiastic</cite> for July, 1846, a magazine
conducted by clergy of the
Established Church.)</p>

<p>If, then, the advocate for modern
music be unable to point to
any such fact as this for his art&mdash;if
he be compelled to acknowledge
that it is necessarily confined to
people either of European origin
or education; that it is no song<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[651]</a></span>
for the Caffre of Africa, the Tartar
of Asia, the savage of Australia,
the Red Indian of North America,
the Esquimaux, the Paraguay Indian&mdash;nothing
but the luxury of
the European; there can be little
room to doubt that, on this last
particular also, the Ritual Chant is
the only adequate fulfilment of the
divine idea.</p>

<h3>DR. DRAPER.</h3>

<p>In consequence of the eulogy
passed by Prof. Tyndall on Dr.
Draper’s book, which is entitled a
<cite>History of the Intellectual Development
of Europe</cite>, we inquired with
some curiosity for this work, and
have since examined it. It is
evident that Prof. Tyndall himself
is largely indebted to it, as he
states; but a more flimsy and superficial
attempt to trace the history
of philosophy we have never met
with. It seems that this gentleman,
Dr. Draper, is a professor of chemistry
and physiology at New York.
His object, as he informs us, in this
compilation, was to arrange the evidence
of the intellectual history of
Europe on <em>physiological</em> principles.
The style is feeble and incorrect,
and the analysis of the Greek philosophy
positively ludicrous. As,
however, it might be inferred from
Prof. Tyndall’s address that Dr. Draper
was, like himself, a disciple and
admirer of Democritus, we will give
the American philosopher the benefit
of citing his own appreciation of
the atomic theory. After stating
that the theory of chemistry, as it
now exists, essentially includes the
views of Democritus (a point on
which we bow to his authority), he
proceeds thus, if we may be permitted
slightly to abridge a very
clumsy sentence:</p>

<p>“A system thus based on secure
mathematical considerations, and
taking as its starting-point a vacuum
and atoms&mdash;the former actionless
and passionless, which recognizes in
compound bodies specific arrangements
of atoms to one another;
which can rise to the conception
that even a single atom may constitute
a world&mdash;such a system may
commend itself to our attention for
its results, but surely not to our
approval, when we find it carrying
us to the conclusion that the soul
is only a finely-constituted form
fitted into a grosser frame; that
even to reason itself there is an
impossibility of all certainty; that
the final result of human inquiry
is the absolute demonstration that
man is incapable of knowledge;
that the world is an illusive phantasm;
and that there is no God.”</p>

<p>Such is the sentence passed upon
Democritus and the atomic theory
by Dr. Draper, on whom Prof. Tyndall
assures us that he relies implicitly
as an authority in the history
of philosophy. Dr. Draper’s account
of the philosophical opinions
and writings of Cicero is in the
highest degree inaccurate. But
enough; we have done with him,
and we advise Prof. Tyndall to seek
a better guide. Suppose, for example,
he were to read the dialogue
of Velleius and Cotta in the first
book of the <cite>De Natura Deorum</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>&mdash;<cite>Edinburgh

<h3>DANIEL O’CONNELL.</h3>

<p>Man seeks in nature a hidden
sympathy with himself. The quickened
beatings of his heart, the restless
currents of his mind, make for
themselves a reflex image in the
forces of the sea and sky. For
ever, the white crests of the breakers
rolling in from the western
ocean curl up and lash themselves
against the rocks on the coast of
Kerry. For ever, in the gray dusk,
the waves, advancing and retreating,
moan out a sad and hollow
sound. In sorrow and in gladness
their monotone is the same. Yet
it well might be that the Irish peasant,
in the year 1775, gathering
kelp for his patch of land from the
shallow coves where the sea broke
in over his naked feet, felt, without
thinking too closely about it, that
nature, chill, leaden, and stern, mirrored
there his own lot. The sudden
gleams of blue sky through the
drifting clouds reflected a buoyant
humor that no sufferings could
quite subdue.</p>

<p>George III. had reigned fifteen
years. Dull, bigoted, cruel; striving
in a blind way to be honest, but
his blood tainted with the stains
of centuries of intolerance, he was
now the living type of Protestant
fanaticism. In Europe, the old
order of things existed without
break or fissure. In America, the
first heavings of the volcano were
plainly felt. The King, Lords, and
Commons of Ireland existed in
name. The Irish Parliament sat
in College Green to register the
degrees of the English Privy Council.
But what a Parliament! Four
millions of Catholics without a representative.
The broken Treaty
of Limerick might still be spoken
of among the traditions of the Irish
peasantry, but its guaranties had
sunk more completely out of the
mind of the English and Irish legislatures
than the statutes of Gloucester.
The Penal Code was in
full legal effect. Burke had described
it a few years before with
the calmness of concentrated passion
as “well-digested and well-disposed
in all its parts; a machine
of wise and elaborate contrivance,
and as well fitted for the oppression,
impoverishment, and degradation
of a people, and the debasement
in them of human nature itself,
as ever proceeded from the perverted
ingenuity of man.” Yet
even Burke hardly gave credit
enough to the magnificent qualities
of the race which was able to survive
this code. It failed in its object.
It did not succeed in extirpating
them. It never could degrade
them, for they yielded neither
to its blandishments nor its terrors.</p>

<p>But though holding fast the faith
with such power as if God’s arm
specially supported them therein
for providential ends, English Protestant
domination had broken
down and crushed this once proud
race to the very earth, in all material
ways. The Israelites sweated
not more hopelessly in the Egyptian
sands. In some respects the
lot of the Irish was worse. Their
task-masters were an intruding race;
they were aliens in their own land.
The face of the country in many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[653]</a></span>
places still bore mute witness to
Cromwell’s pathway of blood and
fire. Then the scriptural image had
been reversed, and the Irish had
been hewn down like the Canaanites
of old. The noonday horrors
of Drogheda and Wexford had left
a scar in the national memory
which time has not yet effaced.
Murder, lust, and rapine, under the
guise of religious fanaticism, had
made this people throw up its hands
despairingly to heaven, as if hell itself
had been thrown open, and its
demons issued forth to scourge the
land. The XVIIIth century had
opened under changed, but it could
hardly be said better auspices. The
fury of destruction had ceased, but
had been succeeded by the ingenious
devices of legislative hatred
and tyranny. The sword of Cromwell,
dripping with the blood of
men, women, and children, had
given place to the gibbet of William
of Orange. The lawless murderer
was followed by the judicial torturer
and jailer. The successors of William
III. trod faithfully in his footsteps.
The parliaments of Anne,
of George I., of George II. heaped
new fetters on the Irish papist.
What wonder that a lethargy like
death settled down upon the native
race? The national idea was almost
lost. It wavered and flickered
like an expiring flame, yet was
not quite extinguished. In caves
and barns, by stealth, and at uncertain
times, the Irish priest poured
out a little oil from his scanty cruse
which kept alive in the heart of his
countrymen the memory of his religion
and his national history. The
“iron fangs” of the code relaxed a
little during the first years of the
reign of George III. Its victim lay
stretched supine. More truly even
than on a later occasion the words
of Henry Grattan might have been
applied to the condition of the
country. Ireland “lay helpless and
motionless as if in the tomb.” But
though politically dead, the vitality
of the race was inexhaustible, unconquerable.
Population increased.
There was little or no emigration
except among the Protestant
linen weavers of the north. The
amazing fertility of the soil, spite
of legislative drawbacks, made food
plentiful. An English traveller,
Arthur Young, in 1776, found the
Irish peasantry quiet, apathetic,
content to till their wretched holdings,
at the mercy of their landlords,
without complaint so long as they
could keep a shelter over their
heads, and had potatoes enough to
eat. Political ambition or aspirations,
the hope or even desire of
shaking off their chains and asserting
their rights as freemen, did not
seem to exist among them. Thus
far the oppression of centuries had
done its work. Some efforts at
enfranchisement had been made by
the Norman Catholic aristocracy
and the few old families of pure
Irish blood who still held their
estates, or portions of them, by
sufferance; but the words of Swift
continued true of the mass of the
native race&mdash;not from want of natural
capacity or manhood&mdash;far
from it; but from the effect of this
grinding oppression of centuries,
and the systematic uprooting of all
organization among them by English
policy. They were “altogether
as inconsiderable,” said the author
of <cite>Drapier’s Letters</cite>, “as the women
and children, … without leaders,
without discipline, … little better
than hewers of wood and drawers
of water, and out of all capacity
of doing any mischief if they
were ever so well inclined.” Swift
went further and declared them
devoid of “natural courage.” But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[654]</a></span>
this was the libel of the Protestant
Dean, not the belief of the Irish
patriot. The title of the land, with
a few unimportant exceptions, had
passed completely out of the native
race. Under the law none could
be purchased. Education was forbidden.
Yet such was the ardor
of the inherited love of learning
which had once distinguished the
island, that Arthur Young found
everywhere schools under the
hedges, or, as he himself says, often
in the ditches.</p>

<p>The breath of liberty was beginning
to stir among the Protestants
of the north, and the Volunteer
movement was soon to lead the way
to the short-lived recognition of the
legislative independence of Ireland
which terminated with the Union.
But among the mass of the Catholic
Irish peasantry no corresponding
feeling as to their political rights
was manifested, or was even in any
degree possible. Arms were forbidden
them. Terrible as the appellation
sounds applied to that
chivalrous race which had won a
deserved renown on so many battlefields
of Europe, at home they,
were, in all outward respects, helots.
The risings which sometimes
took place were seldom or never political.
They were solely agrarian.
The infamous tithe-proctor roused
a spasmodic, bloody resistance,
which ended with the removal of
the special cause exciting it, never
extending to any effective organization
against the political slavery
under which they lay torpid. The
Whiteboys and Hearts of Steel were
not the material, nor were their aims
and programmes the policy, out of
which could spring such a revolution
as was contemporaneously taking
place in the American colonies.
The mass of the people looked on
in hopeless indifference at the outbreaks
of those secret societies, or
in some instances voluntarily combined
against their indiscriminate
violence. The native Irish bore
their misery alone, without friends
or sympathy except from France;
and the interference of this power,
by means of some feeble and unsuccessful
landings in Ireland, served
only to irritate England and
tighten the chains of her captive.
The mighty lever of moral support
which is now wielded by the united
voice of her sons in every quarter
of the globe did not exist. In some
counties, such as Kerry, where the
native language was chiefly spoken,
and the Milesian Irish largely predominated,
the harsh hand of the
law was never stretched out but to
seize upon the substance or the life
of the people. The memory of liberty
could scarcely be said to exist
in the hearts of this ancient race.
That gift which the Greek fable had
declared to have remained at the
bottom of Pandora’s box when all
else escaped, seemed to have taken
wing from Ireland. Hope had fled.</p>

<p>In that age, under those skies,
Daniel O’Connell was born.</p>

<p>One hundred years have passed.
Rises now the Genius of the Irish
race in America to celebrate the centennial
anniversary of that glorious
birth, to invoke in tones that peal
across the waves&mdash;the memory of
that illustrious and beloved name.
A majestic, youthful presence,
daughter of Erin, robed in white
and with a garland of green upon
her brow, comes with her sisters to
lay a wreath upon the tomb of the
Liberator of his country. <i lang="la">Non omnis
moriar</i>, wrote the Latin poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I shall not wholly die. Some part,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Nor that a little, shall</div>
<div class="verse">Escape the dark Destroyer’s dart</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And his grim festival.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Conquerors and statesmen have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[655]</a></span>
repeated his words. But neither
the glories of war nor the triumphs
of politics have won for any a
surer immortality than O’Connell’s.
His fortunes waning at the close,
his blighted hopes, the broken
column of his labors, have only
endeared his memory the more to
his countrymen. Time has terminated
discussion or softened its asperity.
Nothing is remembered
but his love and his labors for Ireland.
From Montreal to New Orleans,
from the first shore on which
the Irish exile set his foot, across
the continent to the Pacific Coast,
over an expanse of country so vast
that the parent isle would form but
an oasis in its central desert&mdash;myriad
voices repeat his name,
proclaiming in various forms of
words, but with one meaning,
this eternal truth, that freedom
beaten to the earth will rise again.
If in spirit the heroic figure of
the great Tribune could top once
more the Hill of Tara, what a spectacle
would spread out before his
eye unobscured by its earthly
veil! A mightier multitude would
listen to his strong and mellow
voice. The descendants of the
men into whose bruised and downcast
hearts he first breathed the
hope and the ardor of liberty have
built up a greater Ireland in America.
Sharing in the glories and
faithful to the traditions of American
freedom&mdash;yielding to none in
the duties of citizenship&mdash;they
have yet carried with them, and
handed down to their sons, that
love of the mother country which
seems ever to burn with a brighter
flame in man’s heart in enforced or
unmerited exile. Irish-American
generals have equalled or eclipsed
the fame of those distinguished
soldiers whose exploits in the service
of foreign powers are household
words in the military history
of the race.</p>

<p>Citizens and soldiers unite to
commemorate the birth of the man
whose single arm struck off the
fetters that had bound their fathers
for nearly three hundred years.</p>

<p>If we turn to Ireland itself, we
shall find the change which has
been accomplished in those one
hundred years in some respects
more profound and startling than
the corresponding advance in the
fortunes of the Irish in America.
The latter has been the regular
and graduated result of causes
working in ascertained channels;
the former has all the character of a
moral revolution. Ireland has not,
it is true, gained that political independence
with which her sons in
these United States started. But
over the far longer road before her
to reach that goal her stride has
been vast and, if we consider the
growth of nations, rapid. To appreciate
the transformation in the
character and position of the Irish
peasant we must recall what he was
in 1775. Catholic emancipation
was a wrench to the religious and
social traditions of the English
nation, and at the same time a
dead-lift to the moral status of the
Irish, to which no parallel will be
found in history. Repeal failed
from causes which we can now
easily discern, but which were hidden
from O’Connell by his proximity
to the Union. But no Coercion
Bills can conceal the fact that the
strength of Ireland is growing in a
ratio greater than her bonds. The
tendency of modern European
politics, and, willingly or unwillingly,
of English legislation itself, and
the increasing material prosperity
of Ireland, are adverse to them, and
continuously wearing them away.
Her national spirit is indomitable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[656]</a></span>
The hour may be distant, but it is
inevitable, when they will fall from
around her, and she will step forth
in all the majesty of freedom.</p>

<p>What, then, is the place O’Connell
holds in the national development
of his race during those one hundred
years? What are the achievements,
greater than all defeats,
which demand from his countrymen
a recognition that no centennial
celebration of his memory can
too honorably offer.</p>

<p>In any view of modern Irish history
it is essential to a clear understanding
of its motives that we
should distinguish the character
and position of the three great
races occupying the island. It is
not enough to divide the people
into Saxon and Celt. The native
Irish race, the blended result of
the successive ancient colonizations
of the island, remained essentially
distinct from the Catholic Norman
Irish even after the Reformation.
The intermarriages and adoption
of Irish customs, which had early
given to the descendants of Strongbow’s
followers the title “Hibernicis
Hiberniores,” had still left
them a higher caste. They retained
a not inconsiderable portion of
their great estates through all the
civil wars. The Penal Code never
fell upon them with the rigor and
leaden weight that paralyzed the
native Irish. Their wealth purchased
immunity. Although formally
ostracized from political life, their
influence as landowners secured
them consideration. The observance
of the duties enjoined by their
religion was connived at. In other
cases they were powerful enough to
make it respected.</p>

<p>Far different was the case of the
Milesian Irish. Their history had
been a series of heroic struggles,
ending in what appeared to be
irretrievable disaster. Before the
process of consolidation, which was
simultaneously going on all over
Europe, and which would have
welded the various septs and kingdoms
into one nation, could be
completed, the Norman invasion
under Strongbow had introduced a
new and more furious element of
strife. The Reformation only
changed their masters, but changed
them for the worse. Hitherto they
had been serfs. They now became
helots. The glorious deeds of
arms of the O’Neals and other
chieftains, which more than once
threatened to drive the English
into the sea, delayed but could not
finally avert the complete triumph
of combined craft and superior resources.
Projects for the extirpation
of the native race were freely
mooted. Famine, the sword, and
the gallows at one time seemed almost
to promise it. The same price
was set on the priest’s and the
wolf’s head. A non-Catholic writer,
Lecky, gives this summary of the
Penal Code as it existed when
O’Connell was born:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“By this code the Roman Catholics
were absolutely excluded from the Parliament,
from the magistracy, from the corporations,
from the bench, and from the
bar. They could not vote at parliamentary
elections or at vestries. They could
not act as constables, or sheriffs, or jurymen,
or serve in the army or navy, or
become solicitors, or even hold the position
of gamekeeper or watchman. Schools
were established to bring up their children
as Protestants; and if they refused to
avail themselves of these, they were deliberately
consigned to hopeless ignorance,
being excluded from the university, and
debarred under crushing penalties from
acting as schoolmasters, as ushers, or as
private tutors, or from sending their children
abroad to obtain the instruction they
were refused at home. They could not
marry Protestants; and if such a marriage
were celebrated, it was annulled by
law, and the priest who officiated might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[657]</a></span>
be hung. They could not buy land, or
inherit or receive it as a gift from Protestants,
or hold life annuities, or leases
for more than thirty-one years, or any
lease on such terms that the profit of the
land exceeded one third of the rent. If
any Catholic leaseholder so increased his
profits that they exceeded this proportion,
and did not immediately make a
corresponding increase in his payments,
any Protestant who gave the information
could enter into possession of his farm.
If any Catholic had secretly purchased
his old forfeited estate, or any other land,
any Protestant who informed against him
might become the proprietor. The few
Catholic landholders who remained were
deprived of the right which all other
classes possessed, of bequeathing their
lands as they pleased. If their sons continued
Catholic, it was divided equally
between them. If, however, the eldest
son consented to apostatize, the estate
was settled upon him, the father from
that hour becoming only a life-tenant, and
losing all power of selling, mortgaging,
or otherwise disposing of it. If the wife
of a Catholic abandoned the religion of
her husband, she was immediately free
from his control, and the chancellor was
empowered to assign her a certain proportion
of her husband’s property. If
any child, however young, professed itself
a Protestant, it was at once taken
from its father’s care, and the chancellor
could oblige the father to declare upon
oath the value of his property, both real
and personal, and could assign for the
present maintenance and future portion
of the converted child such proportion of
that property as the court might decree.
No Catholic could be guardian either to
his own children or those of any other
person; and therefore a Catholic who
died while his children were minors, had
the bitterness of reflecting upon his deathbed
that they must pass into the care of
Protestants. An annuity of from twenty
to forty pounds was provided as a bribe
for every priest who would become a
Protestant. To convert a Protestant to
Catholicism was a capital offence. In
every walk of life the Catholic was pursued
by persecution or restriction. Except
in the linen trade, he could not have
more than two apprentices. He could
not possess a horse of more than the value
of five pounds, and any Protestant
upon giving him five pounds could take
his horse. He was compelled to pay
double to the militia. He was forbidden,
except under particular conditions, to
live in Galway or Limerick. In case of
a war with a Catholic power, the Catholics
were obliged to reimburse the damage
done by the enemy’s privateers. The
legislature, it is true, did not venture
absolutely to suppress their worship, but
it existed only by a doubtful connivance,
stigmatized as if it were a species of licensed
prostitution, and subject to conditions
which, if they had been enforced,
would have rendered its continuance impossible.
An old law which prohibited
it, and another which enjoined attendance
at the Anglican worship, remained unrepealed,
and might at any time be revived;
and the former was in fact enforced during
the Scotch rebellion of 1715. The
parish priests, who alone were allowed
to officiate, were compelled to be registered,
and were forbidden to keep curates,
or officiate anywhere except in their
own parishes. The chapels might not
have bells or steeples. No crosses might
be publicly erected. Pilgrimages to the
holy wells were forbidden. Not only all
monks and friars, but also all Catholic
archbishops, bishops, deacons, and other
dignitaries, were ordered by a certain day
to leave the country, and, if after that date
they were found in Ireland, they were
liable to be first imprisoned and then
banished; and if after that banishment
they returned to discharge their duties in
their dioceses, they were liable to the
punishment of death. To facilitate the
discovery of offences against the code,
two justices of the peace might at any
time compel any Catholic of eighteen
years of age to declare when and where
he last heard Mass, what persons were
present, and who officiated; and if he refused
to give evidence they might imprison
him for twelve months, or until he
paid a fine of twenty pounds. Any one
who harbored ecclesiastics from beyond
the seas was subject to fines which for
the third offence amounted to the confiscation
of all his goods. A graduated
scale of rewards was offered for the discovery
of Catholic bishops, priests, and
schoolmasters; and a resolution of the
House of Commons pronounced the prosecuting
and informing against papists
‘an honorable service to the government.’”<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This is a dark picture. Yet it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[658]</a></span>
drawn by an unwilling hand. Instances
might be accumulated where
the severity of the law was outstripped
by the barbarity of its execution.
Important relief bills were
passed in 1777 and 1793. But they
provided only for the removal of
some of the civil and political disabilities
of the Catholics. The
badge of religious degradation remained
untouched. The heaviest
fetters of that iron code still trailed
after the limbs of the Irish Catholic.
It is the glory of O’Connell
that he finally snapped them in
twain, and trampled them for ever
in the dust. Englishman, Norman,
and Milesian&mdash;the British colonist
who clung to a proscribed faith in
every quarter of the globe&mdash;shared
in the results of that herculean
labor.</p>

<p>But it is the special claim of
O’Connell to the eternal gratitude
of that native Irish race to which
he belonged, that he, first of all,
after that bondage of centuries,
taught them to lift up their heads
to the level of freemen. Had
his work stopped at Emancipation,
had his claim to fame and a
place in the national memory been
included solely in the noble title
of Liberator, enough had been done
by one man for humanity and his
own renown. But in the course
of that long struggle a greater and
further-reaching consequence was
involved. A transformation took
place in the character of the native
Irish, the full results of which are
not yet visible. In their journey
through the desert, in their marchings
and counter-marchings, their
victories and transient defeats, as
they neared the borders of the
promised land towards which he
led them, a change wonderful, but
not without parallel, became visible
in their spirit and their hopes.
Insensibly and by slow degrees the
political torpor of centuries yielded
to a new and living warmth. A
generation sprang up which had
flung aside the isolation and submissive
hopelessness of 1775, yet
was capable of a greater and more
sustained effort than the frenzy of
despair which prompted ’98. Under
the ardor of O’Connell’s burning
words, a full understanding of
the functions of self-government
permeated a race which had hitherto
seemed to exist by the sufferance
of its masters. He not only liberated
his countrymen from religious
bondage, he organized them into a
nation. He gave them the first
impact of self-government since the
Invasion. And that impact is never
again likely to be lost.</p>

<p>Daniel O’Connell did not, like
some other great popular leaders,
spring directly from the midst of
the people whose passions he swayed
and whose actions moved obedient
to his will. His family belonged to
the old Irish gentry. He had the
advantages of that collegiate course
in France which was the only way
then open to Catholics of the upper
classes to afford their sons a liberal
education. Yet his family was allied
closely enough to the people
to make him share in all their feelings,
sympathies, and sufferings.
The author whom we have already
quoted, with that curious blindness,
the result of unconscious prejudice,
which makes most non-Catholic writers,
however otherwise acute, miss
the true threads of Irish history,
and insult the national sensibility
at the very moment they think
themselves the most liberal, sets
down as a defect in O’Connell what
was in reality the secret of his power.
“With the great qualities,”
he says, “of O’Connell there were
mingled great defects, which I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[659]</a></span>
not attempted to conceal, and
which are of a kind peculiarly repulsive
to a refined and lofty nature.
His character was essentially that
of a Celtic peasant.”</p>

<p>Yes, this was at once his glory
and his strength. O’Connell’s personal
traits of character reflected
faithfully, on a heroic scale, the
national features of his race.
Not the coarseness nor scurrility
ascribed to it by the stage buffoon
or the unsympathetic publicist,
but the powerful yet subtle
understanding which has won for
Irishmen in every age the highest
distinction in the field and in the
schools, the large, warm heart, easily
swayed by generous impulses,
the humor closely allied to tears
which is the secret of the most
popular oratory. It is this thorough
identification with the national
spirit, with the religion
which the persecution of centuries
had made inseparable from
it, that makes O’Connell without
equal or second among the great
men who nobly contended for their
country’s freedom at the end of
the last and beginning of the present
century. He stands alone, gifted
with a power to which neither
the highest intellect nor the most
brilliant oratory could otherwise
obtain. He swayed the force of
the nation he had welded into
shape. It was this tremendous
lever&mdash;obedient, one might almost
say without figure of speech, to his
single arm&mdash;that enabled him to
wrest Catholic Emancipation from
the combined determined opposition
of the King, Parliament, and
people of England.</p>

<p>For forty years Henry Grattan
labored with chivalrous devotion
in the service of Ireland. His eloquence
has a charm, a poetical inspiration,
a classical finish O’Connell’s
never equalled. It thrilled
the Irish Parliament like the sound
of a trumpet, and held spell-bound
the hostile English House of Commons.
His patriotism was as unselfish,
his zeal, in a certain sense,
as ardent as O’Connell’s. Yet
what did Grattan ultimately accomplish?
What was the end of
all these noble gifts and labors?
Having, as he said, “watched by
the cradle” of the constitutional independence
of the Irish Parliament,
he lived to “follow its hearse”;
and when he died in 1820, Catholic
Emancipation, the cause of
which had been committed to his
hands, became more hopelessly
distant than ever. His was individual
genius, individual energy,
of a very high, if not the highest,
type. But it needed something
more to win in such a cause.
Classical eloquence was thrown
away in such a struggle. The
concentrated strength of national
enthusiasm, careless of form, animated
only by a single giant purpose,
was demanded. Grattan,
though such a man as Irishmen
of every creed might well be proud
of, was, unfortunately for his success
in the attainment of great national
aims, neither a Catholic nor
identified with the “Celtic peasant.”
He lacked the fundamental
force bred of the soil. O’Connell,
on the other hand, might truly
be likened to that fabled giant of
antiquity, Antæus, who gained a
tenfold strength each time he was
flung upon his mother earth. Well
might he declare, when reproached
on one occasion for the violence of
his language, “If I did not use
the sledge-hammer, I could never
crush our enemies.” It was a war
of extremities. It was an epoch
surcharged with the elements of
moral explosions, when men’s passions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[660]</a></span>
were roused to the highest
pitch. Those who read now the
measured language of Disraeli in
Parliament will pause in astonishment
when they turn back to the
frenzied raving with which he replied
on a memorable occasion to
the terrible invective of O’Connell.
In such an era of violence, of anarchic
strife, Grattan’s “winged
words” fell harmless, but O’Connell’s
“sledge-hammer,” wielded
with the arm of Thor, thundered
its most effective blows.</p>

<p>Another great Irishman had passed
off the stage while the young
Dublin law student, Daniel O’Connell,
was still only dreaming of the
liberation of his country. Edmund
Burke&mdash;revered and illustrious
name!&mdash;had rounded off the labors
of his long and honorable
life in the cause of oppressed humanity,
wherever found, by some
strenuous and well-directed efforts
for the relief of his Catholic fellow-countrymen.
Yet he too failed,
or at best gained but an indifferent
success. The principles he
enunciated are imperishable; his
arguments will be preserved for
ever among the grandest vindications
of religious liberty in the
English tongue. But in that age
they fell upon deaf ears. He too
wanted that element of success
which comes from identity of race,
religion, feelings, opinions, sympathies.
To that native Irish race
which must ever determine the
destinies of Ireland he was a
stranger. What a satire upon humanity
to expect that men in their
position&mdash;bondsmen, systematically,
and under legal penalties, deprived
of all education, of every
means of information&mdash;could appreciate
the teachings of a political
philosopher, living in what
they regarded, with good cause, as
a foreign or even hostile country.
It was well if they knew of his existence.
He was no leader for
them. Nor did Burke ever affect
to act with them, but rather for
them, upon the convictions of the
higher English and Irish classes.
Hence it is that O’Connell is to
be regarded as the purely national
type of leader; by means of action
exercising a more powerful influence
on human affairs through
the wide-spread Irish race than
Burke by means of thought.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that we place
O’Connell on a high plane&mdash;above,
and different from, that of mere
orators, or statesmen administering
established affairs, however great.
He is to be ranked with the nation-builders
of all ages. This was the
verdict of most contemporary European
observers, of Montalembert,
of Ventura, and other exponents of
continental public opinion. To
the English mind he was, and probably
will always be, a demagogue,
pure and simple. But so no doubt
was Themistocles to the Persians.
O’Connell stormed too many English
prejudices&mdash;stormed them with
a violence which to his opponents
seemed extravagant and unendurable,
but without which he could
never have gained his end&mdash;to be
forgiven. The judgment of his
countrymen, however&mdash;the supreme
arbiter for him&mdash;is already maturing
to a decision in his favor which
will place him in a niche in the
hall of Irish heroes above all
others, and side by side with that
old king whose memory recalls the
ancient glories and victories of Ireland.</p>

<p>But what of his defeats?&mdash;of the
failure of Repeal? This is not a
panegyric on O’Connell, but a sincere
examination of his place in
Irish history. In many instances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[661]</a></span>
and above all on the question of
Repeal, he miscalculated his forces
and the strength of the forces opposed
to him. Like the greatest
men of action in every age, his
movements were directed by the
circumstances and exigencies of
the occasion, by experience, by the
shifting currents of events, by his
ability to create those currents, or
to turn them to his own purpose.
The cast-iron rules of policy which
political philosophers formulate in
their closets may be singularly inappropriate
for the uses of popular
leaders. In 1829, under the banner
of Moral Force, with the nation
arrayed behind him, he had
wrested Emancipation from the
king and ministry. It was an immense
triumph. His temperament
was sanguine&mdash;an element of weakness,
but also of strength. In
the hopeless state in which he
found Ireland, only a character
of the most enthusiastic kind would
have ventured on the crusade he
opened. In 1843, he thought he
could repeat his victory on the
question of Repeal. But in 1829
Peel and Wellington yielded, not
to moral force, which, so far as Ireland
is concerned, is a term unknown
in English politics, but to
the armed figure of rebellion standing
behind it. They were not prepared
for the contest. In 1843, the
English ministry were ready to
crush opposition with an overwhelming
military force. If they
did not invite rebellion, as in ’98,
they were equally ready to ride
roughshod over Ireland. The
circumstances of the contest had
also changed. Catholic Emancipation
attacked the religious prejudices
of England; Repeal threatened
its existence as a nation. It could
grant the one, and still maintain
its hatred of Popery; it could not
yield the other without setting up
a legislature with rival interests in
politics and trade. The instinct
of self-preservation was evoked. No
argument will ever convince the
average Englishman that in restoring
a separate, independent Parliament
to Ireland, he is not laying
the foundation of a hostile state.
The result in 1843 was inevitable.
As soon as a sufficient military
force was concentrated, remonstrance
or negotiation ceased. England
simply drew her sword and
flung it into the scale. O’Connell
and his associates were thrown into
prison, and the guns of the Pigeon-House
Fort were trained on the
road to Clontarf.</p>

<p>In the varied history of the human
race few spectacles have ever
been presented of equal moral
grandeur to those immense peaceful
open-air meetings which gathered
to hear the great tribune. No
greater testimony was ever given
of a nation’s confidence and love.
Competent judges put down the
number who assembled at the Hill
of Tara at half a million of people.
Yet to the unbiassed observer there
is something almost as pathetic in
the helplessness of this great multitude&mdash;hoping
to wrest their independence
from England without
arms&mdash;as grand in the mighty surge
of its numbers. It was the confederacy
of the sheep against the
wolves. O’Connell’s failure shows
vividly how narrow is the plank
upon which the popular leader
walks between an immortal triumph
and a prison cell. It reveals the
tremendous power residing in an
organized government, capable only
of resistance by a people in arms
and inured to the use of arms.
That was a monster meeting of a
different kind held on Bunker Hill
one hundred years ago, and commemorated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[662]</a></span>
this year by these United
States.</p>

<p>We are neither impeaching here
the wisdom of the course pursued
by O’Connell in 1843, nor advising
armed rebellion against England
at the present day. We discuss
simply the historical aspects of the
question in the light of the experience
of other nations. Nothing
can be more hazardous, however,
or often absolutely fallacious, than
broad generalizations from the history
of other countries as capable
of determining a particular line of
policy for any given state. In nothing
else did O’Connell show a
higher wisdom as a leader of the
Irish people than in rejecting those
specious appeals to the success of
arms in America, made by the more
ardent patriots in 1845-46.</p>

<p>The circumstances of the two
countries were radically different.
The Americans exhausted every
kind of “moral force” at their disposal,
and their revolution, when it
finally came to blows, was not aggressive
but defensive; the policy
of England made it incumbent on
Ireland to strike the first blow in a
contest which she would quickly
have found herself unable to sustain.
The Americans had a boundless
territory; the Irish a narrow
island, capable of being pierced
from shore to shore by English
troops in three weeks. The Americans
were trained to arms by a
war of one hundred years with the
French and Indians, in which they
were drilled and fought side by
side with English regiments; the
Irish&mdash;the native Catholic Irish,
the people for whom O’Connell was
responsible before God and mankind&mdash;could
not keep a pike since
the Treaty of Limerick. An Irish rebellion,
therefore, would have meant
simply a massacre; and O’Connell,
in choosing the wiser course of
present submission to superior force,
merited as much, although in defeat,
the gratitude of his countrymen as
he did in his triumph in the cause
of Emancipation. For it will
have been gathered from what we
have already said that we regard
O’Connell’s greatest achievement
in the service of his country&mdash;its
political organization, the education
of its sons in the knowledge of
the rights and duties of freemen&mdash;as
going on with equal step as well
with the unsuccessful agitation for
Repeal as with the triumphant struggle
for Emancipation. His defeats
carried with them the germs of
victory. The most ardent lover of
his country can scarce escape an
uneasy feeling when he reads in the
annals of Ireland that story, reiterated
with painful monotony,
page after page, of the harryings,
the devastations, the ceaseless intestine
wars, which mark its early
history. It would seem sometimes
as if the ancient learning of Ireland
which produced those numerous
and minute chronicles, served only
the purpose of a reproach to the
island which fostered it. Other
nations had struggled through this
transition period&mdash;common to the
whole of Europe&mdash;and finally consolidated
themselves into peaceful
and harmonious states. But it was
the misfortune of Ireland that this
opportunity of domestic organization
was snatched from her by a
foreign invasion ending in a domination
of which the cardinal principle
was to “divide and conquer.”
English writers satirize the civil
discord of the Irish race, forgetful
that from the time of Henry II. to
that of George III. it was the
steady, and as it then seemed intelligent,
policy of successive English
statesmen to foster wars between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[663]</a></span>
the rival chieftains and clans, to
employ them against one another,
and in every way to break down
any incipient attempt at union,
which must have been dangerous,
if not fatal, to English power. No
man had arisen among the Irish
race till O’Connell’s time who
neutralized that policy. He showed
that they were capable of organization
and self-government in a
patriotic common cause. In those
immense meetings which marked
his progress, where men of every
county united in one vast brotherhood,
he proved, first, that the Irish
people loved domestic peace and
co-operation as much as any other
race; and, secondly, that under
happy auspices they possessed a
wonderful capacity for order and
self control. Even hostile observers
concur in expressing as much
admiration for the undisturbed
peacefulness of those assemblages
of from a quarter to half a million
of people, as amazement at their
vastness, unprecedented in history.
They were the foundation of the
political education of Ireland.</p>

<p>In another country, and a more
remote age, another man of kindred,
kingly spirit and organizing power,
with whom O’Connell is not unworthy
to be compared, had built up
his vast empire by like national
meetings, not less than by force of
arms. In the great national meetings
of the Franks, the <i lang="fr">Champs de
Mai</i>, Charlemagne gave the first
impress of government to Europe,
torn to pieces after the fall of the
Roman Empire. O’Connell, another
“king of men”&mdash;such as the
Homeric legend sings of&mdash;emulated
his labors on a less extended scale
in Ireland. But the empire of
Charlemagne fell to pieces with
his death. Chaos reigned again.
O’Connell’s work was more homogeneous,
and promises to be more
enduring. We are only entering
upon the dawn of a more hopeful
Irish history.</p>

<p>When we seek a comparison of
individual action, in the history of
England, with O’Connell’s, we are
struck at once with the grand but
sorrowful isolation of his position.
Fortunate the country which has
never needed a liberator! Happy
the kingdom whose greatest revolution
meant only a change of dynasty,
a stronger leaven of republicanism,
and surer guarantees against religious
toleration! The growth of
constitutional government in England
has been comparatively steady
and uniform. Never&mdash;since the
amalgamation of races following the
Norman invasion&mdash;subjected to the
terrible consequences of conquest
and occupation by a race alien in
language, religion, and national prejudices,
her political and religious
struggles have been wrought out to
an issue among her own population.
Whenever her civil liberty or parliamentary
privileges were threatened,
sturdy champions were not
wanting among her own sons. Her
Pyms, Hampdens, and Eliots find
their counterparts in the Grattans
and Floods of Ireland. But the
deliverer of a crushed and hopeless
people, the inspired guide who led
them out of bondage and defied
their taskmasters, is a figure happily
absent in English history.</p>

<p>The imagination naturally turns
with vivid interest to great deeds
of arms. The pomp and panoply
of war, the heroic daring of the
headlong charge, the valor, disdainful
of death, that awaits with constancy
an overwhelming foe&mdash;these
are incentives to action, in presence
of which the labors and even
triumphs of peaceful agitation appear
tame and slow. And the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[664]</a></span>
Irish are a people strongly susceptible
to those influences. They
are a warlike race. Wherever the
tide of battle turns against great
odds, where the smoke is thickest,
and the carnage deadliest, there
will be found some Irish name upholding
the traditions of his country’s
fame. O’Connell had therefore
no easy task in restraining
within peaceful limits the immense
agitation he had evoked. And in
estimating his place in history the
same considerations place him at a
disadvantage compared with those
great warriors, the glitter of whose
victories is identified with the warlike
glories of their country. The
“Bridge of Lodi,” the “Sun of
Austerlitz”&mdash;these are talismanic
words which then rang in people’s
ears with startling sequence? Yet
if we compare O’Connell’s labors
and their results with those of the
great soldier whose career had
closed while the former was only
beginning his peaceful struggle
with England, there is no reason
to shrink from the verdict. Emancipation
was worth many Marengos.
The <i lang="fr">rôle</i> of the Liberator may fairly
be set off against that of the
Conqueror. The civic crown of
green and gold placed on O’Connell’s
head on the Rath of Mullaghmast,
in the presence of 400,000
men, was an emblem of true sovereignty
greater in many ways than
that iron crown which Napoleon
lifted with his own ambitious hands
from the altar at Milan. One was
rust-eaten, it might be said, with
the blood and tears of unknown
thousands; the other was invested
with the halo of peace, which the
attainment of religious liberty and
education in the rights of freemen
had introduced into a million humble
homes. The career of both
Napoleon and O’Connell ended in
defeat. But how conflicting the
emotions of each as he gazed for
the last time on the shores of his
country! One, preoccupied by the
shattering of his gigantic ambition,
and the assertion of petty details
of etiquette in the midst of the
ruin around him; the other, oblivious
of self, weighed down by the
doom of famine impending over
his country&mdash;his last words a solemn
and pathetic appeal for its
protection. In the hour of adversity,
stripped of the adventitious
circumstances of power, O’Connell
stands forth a figure of greater
moral grandeur. Of the victories
of Napoleon nothing remains but
their name, and the terrible retribution
that has followed them.
The influence of O’Connell’s unselfish
labors in the cause of religious
freedom has a future practically
endless; and after a season
of adversity and apparent forgetfulness,
his political maxims and
principles are again reviving in Ireland
in the constitutional agitation
for Home Rule. Not in the demand
itself, stopping short as it
does of Repeal, but in the means
by which alone its advocacy may
be made successful.</p>

<p>It is a curious instance of the ebb
and flow of historical movements
that O’Connell was at one time prepared
to take up, under the name
of “Federalism,” the present demand
for “Home Rule.” Ultimately,
as is well known, he was
forced to abandon it by the mutiny
of his followers, who would be
satisfied with nothing less than simple
“Repeal.” And this reluctance
to adopt a middle course was natural
enough at the time. In 1840-45
the Irish people were still too
close to the Union; the infamous history
of that measure and the burning
eloquence of Grattan and Plunkett<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[665]</a></span>
in denouncing it were too strongly impressed
upon the national memory,
to allow any hope of success to a
leader who would promise less than
its total erasure from the statute
book. Too many were still living&mdash;like
O’Connell himself&mdash;who
could remember the brief yet glorious
history of Irish legislative independence,
to give up the belief that
it was yet possible to see an Irish
parliament sitting in College Green.
Experience, and the statesmanship
which does not aim at the unattainable,
have shown the practical
superiority of the lesser demand as
a political programme at the present
day. But this does not impugn the
wisdom of the Repeal agitation.
The true course of a people in its
national affairs is necessarily learned
slowly. There is no ready-made
chart in politics; and were any offered,
Burke’s satire upon geometrical
demonstrations in state affairs
would be conclusive against it.
Experience, even the experience of
failure, is the only trustworthy
guide; and successive agitations,
though varying in their object, keep
alive the cause in the national
memory.</p>

<p>Though the best and truest friends
of Ireland, including that venerable
hierarchy which has steadily seconded
every rational movement for
justice and equal rights, have never
hesitated to give their support to
O’Connell’s policy of moral force,
there have not been wanting from
the first restless spirits who have
made it their bitterest reproach
against him, that he was unwilling
to fling away the scabbard and
plunge the country into rebellion.
It would be unjust to speak of all
these men as influenced by unworthy
motives. Some of them breathed,
and still breathe, the purest aspirations
of patriotism. But it was
a mistaken patriotism, influenced
by examples which might indeed
make martyrs, but which would
never lift one chain from the neck
of their country. They might
make good soldiers, but were poor
leaders. Ireland was not then, and
is not now, in a position to gain
anything by a policy of violence.</p>

<p>But there are others, inflamed
not with a love of Ireland, but with
a spirit of hostility to all governments,
who would plunge their
country into bloodshed in hope
of themselves floating to the top.
These men are infected with the
spirit of the Commune. They are
revolutionists&mdash;not in the sense in
which Washington or Hampden or
O’Connell were revolutionists&mdash;leaders
of great movements for the
liberties of peoples&mdash;but socialists,
whose single incentive is the envy
and hatred of all superior authority.
Most of all, they desire to supplant
the Irish priesthood as the guides
of the people. A sorry exchange,
from the well-tried friends, proved
by the exacting ordeal of a thousand
years, to men of no responsibility&mdash;mere
political gamblers&mdash;whose
highest motive is ambition,
but a lower and more common one,
the love of easy-gotten money from
confiding people. These conspirators
are the promoters of the secret
societies against which O’Connell
warned the Irish people. But
unfortunately they too often find
that generous-hearted race&mdash;embittered
by the recollection of centuries
of oppression&mdash;willing to give
ear to their delusive promises. Indifferent
to their own future, these
men rejoice in anarchy. Some of
them are no doubt poltroons, who
would fly as soon as they had led
their dupes into danger. But it
would be false to deny them all the
attributes of courage. Others would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[666]</a></span>
die bravely enough behind a barricade.
But their wars are essentially
wars of the barricades. If defeated
they would perish recklessly,
having nothing at stake to make
life valuable&mdash;absolutely indifferent
to the slaughter, to the burned
homes, to the widows and orphans
of the unfortunate people who had
submitted to their fatal guidance.
If successful, their next attack would
be upon the Catholic Church. But
success under such leadership is a
delusion wilder than the most exaggerated
dream of fiction. They
have no conception of a national
revolution higher than a conspiracy.
The elevated principles, the
far-sighted calculations of a Washington,
an Adams, or a Franklin,
which almost assured success from
the start, are an unknown language
to them. Blind hatred, even of an
existing tyranny, is a poor basis
upon which to sustain a long and
exhausting war. And no one, with
the history of the American Revolution
before him, can doubt what
the character of an armed struggle
with England for the independence
of Ireland would be.</p>

<p>The same spirit of patriotism,
therefore, that urged Washington to
throw his sword into the scale in
the contest with Great Britain, animated
O’Connell with a contrary
purpose in the case of Ireland.
Yet not less is the latter deserving
of the title of “Father of his Country.”
Success has crowned the
American patriot with a more splendid
fame. But when we weigh the
individual exertions of each in his
gigantic struggle with the great
empire opposed to him, and consider
the incalculable advantages
which a boundless territory and an
intervening ocean afforded to the
American leader, the Irish liberator
will not suffer from the comparison.
Washington was surrounded
and sustained by a group of great
men who would seem to have been
providentially raised up at that
momentous epoch to lay the foundations
of the noble structure of
American liberty. O’Connell, standing
alone, an Atlas supporting the
fortunes of six millions of Irish Catholics
on his shoulders, is a figure
unexampled in history. His herculean
labors recall the fables of
antiquity. In the whole parliamentary
history of England we read of
no other example of one man facing
and trampling over the utmost hostility
of that proud and powerful
assembly&mdash;the English House of
Commons.</p>

<p>Yet though the pre-eminence of
O’Connell makes him appear almost
a solitary figure in the records of
that day, it would be unjust, in a
notice of him, to pass over the assistance
he received from the brilliant
rhetoric and astute intellect
of Richard Lalor Sheil. Though
holding a subordinate place to that
of the great Agitator, and accused
of lukewarmness, in the end, by
O’Connell himself, whose “Sheil,
Sheil! this will never do,” has become
historic, his early exertions
merit a grateful remembrance.
Nor can any Irishman ever forget
the profound learning, the masterly
reasoning, the weight of character
which Dr. Doyle, the celebrated
“J. K. L.,” brought to the contest
in the early days of the Catholic
Association. Rivalling Swift in
the keenness of his satire, and
“Junius” in the brilliancy of his
style, he united to those qualities a
purity of purpose and freedom from
personal rancor which neither of
those writers possessed. His life is
an imperishable monument of the
patriotism of the Catholic hierarchy
of Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[667]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not the purpose of this article
to speak of O’Connell’s position
in the English House of Commons,
of his action on the question of
Reform, or the revenues of the Irish
Church, on which he anticipated the
tardy measure of Mr. Gladstone;
nor of the truly liberal and tolerant
spirit which made him welcome
into the ranks of the Repealers the
talented Protestant youth of Ireland,
and oppose every manifestation
of religious rancor wherever
he found it. We have sufficiently
pointed out what we believe to be
his enduring claims to immortality&mdash;Catholic
Emancipation, and, in
pursuance of that aim and of Repeal,
the new level of political
thought and action to which he
lifted the Irish race. He is the
grandest representative of the pure
Celtic blood of Ireland that the
ages have produced. His power,
like that of all other great national
leaders, depended upon that representative
quality. And he used his
power faithfully. Unlike the great
German chancellor of the present
day, who, beginning with the <i lang="fr">rôle</i>
of a national liberator and organizer,
has ended in a career of foreign
domination and domestic persecution,
O’Connell never perverted the
strongest and noblest of popular
forces to the uses of tyranny under
any form. Prince Bismarck’s plans
lead up to that very régime of hate,
cruelty, and oppression which
O’Connell combated in Ireland,
and if they become the settled
policy of the Empire, must in time
give birth to a German Liberator.</p>

<p>It remains only to say a word
upon the future of that Irish people
to whom O’Connell devoted his
life. We will not venture upon
hazardous speculations. The wisdom
of his policy was never more
apparent than to-day. The motives
upon which it was founded
repeat themselves anew. There are
too many interests in Ireland&mdash;Irish
and Catholic interests&mdash;opposed
to revolutionary violences, to
make rebellion either desirable or
practicable. It is only those who
want to confiscate and live by
tumult that cry out for it. The
same communists who burned Paris
and murdered its priests and archbishop
under the name of liberty,
would like to sack Dublin under
the cry of “Down with the Saxon!”
National ideas are everywhere the
footballs of those radicals, by which
they lead the easily-swayed multitude
to follow them in their game
of plunder. But an Irish communist&mdash;that
is, one born of a Catholic
Irish stock&mdash;is a creature of
abnormal growth. He will never
make much headway in Ireland.</p>

<p>The true course of modern Irish
politics points to the assertion of
that principle of federalism which
has been established as the basis of
government in Austro-Hungary, in
Canada and all the great free British
Colonies, and in the United
States, and which, under the name of
“Home Rule,” is now the matured
policy of the trustworthy exponents
of Irish public opinion.
We would not be understood to
commit ourselves to any particular
political programme, but before
any of what may be termed sentimental
considerations, it would
seem that the leaders of public
opinion in Ireland must direct their
energies to build up its material
prosperity, and this can be best accomplished
by local self-government.
Unanimity in its pursuit is
therefore demanded even of those
who ultimately look beyond it. A
rich and prosperous community
will not long remain enslaved. It
is only the poor who are trampled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[668]</a></span>
on, among nations as among individuals.
It must be admitted, however,
that nothing could well appear
more hopeless than the present
position of the Home Rulers in the
English House of Commons. The
decisive triumph of the Conservative
reaction has put them out of the
calculations of both parties. But
this state of things is not likely to
exist in the next Parliament, nor
in the one after. Courage and endurance,
therefore&mdash;the virtues of
O’Connell&mdash;are the virtues that are
needed in this temporary Slough of
Despond. The contempt, so loudly
and persistently expressed as to
imply some apprehension, the frenzy
of opposition, Home Rule has evoked
in the House of Commons, we
do not count for more than it is
worth. It is not more bitter or
uncompromising than the same
feeling prior to Emancipation or
even Reform. The same threats of
eternal opposition were then common.
It took sixty years of active
opposition to gain the former; the
same number at least and enormous
outside agitation to carry the latter.
The success of great national movements
is necessarily slow against
existing forces, and must often be
transmitted from generation to
generation. There is no need
therefore of discouragement at a
temporary check. Local self-government&mdash;the
same that exists in
New York and Massachusetts, and
for the same objects&mdash;leaving
foreign and exclusively national
questions for the consideration of
an Imperial Parliament, as for Congress&mdash;is
a demand that commends
itself to the feeling of justice of all
mankind, a feeling which England
will eventually be unable to resist.
We are not of those who inculcate
an eternal policy of revenge. This
is easy for irresponsible demagogues
to preach, but blows are not given
without being received. The reality,
the dreadful experiences of war,
soon teach moderation where war
is felt. Even were the two states
independent, peace with England
would be the true policy of Ireland.</p>

<p>As for the Irish in America, the
future lies before them brilliant,
unclouded. It is bounded only by
their own ability to make it honorable
and useful. Relying primarily,
like every other man in the community,
upon his own industry, sobriety,
and energy, the Irishman in
the United States or Canada may
attain to any position he is fitted
for. If in some instances he has
to encounter native prejudices,
these will be best overcome by an
earnest effort on his own part to
observe faithfully all the duties of
citizenship. No one who does so
will ever fail to obtain the respect
and support of his Protestant
neighbors. Those who make foreign
grudges their first consideration
must expect to be looked upon
as strangers. Yet we must
face what exists. So long as the
stream of immigration continues to
pour into this country, so long will
there be a large body of our countrymen,
receiving continual accessions,
whose dearest thoughts will
be directed towards Ireland, their
bitterest towards England. This
is inevitable. England reaps the
fruit of her past. She is now
in the position of a jailer who
would fain take off the handcuffs
from her prisoner, but dares not,
for fear of retrospective revenge.
The misgovernment of ages cannot
be blotted out from the memory of
the misgoverned in a day&mdash;nor in
a hundred years. It is a national
Nemesis; and it will be well for
England if it do not overtake her
in some dreadful form. This feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[669]</a></span>
naturally finds its strongest
expression in the United States.
Sympathy with the mother country
will never fail. And God forbid
that it should do so. But let that
sympathy take a proper direction, an
efficient form. Give the strength
of your moral support&mdash;of your
purses, if you will&mdash;to the men
who are carrying on under a different
form the work of O’Connell
in Ireland&mdash;who are now
bravely struggling for Home Rule.
But turn a stern countenance on
those adventurers and desperadoes
who have nothing wiser to advise
than wild and criminal incursions
into a friendly province, where
Irishmen possess all the rights they
do here, or conspiracies and secret
societies in Ireland&mdash;projects
which make the honest patriotism
and tried courage of Irishmen a
farce for the laughter of mankind.
The Irish in America have many
traps laid for their nationality and
their faith; but let them avoid
the snares of revolutionary, infidel
leaders for themselves, and of godless
schools for their children, and
the day will eventually dawn when
the weight of their support will
turn the scale in favor of their
country’s rights against England.
This is the true way to follow the
example and honor the memory
of O’Connell.</p>

<p>In spirit, the Great Liberator still
beckons the way to his countrymen.
The echo of that voice, sonorous,
but clear and sweet as a silver bell,
is heard no more on the hillsides
of Erin. The clover springs up
where the feet of thousands pressed
closer to listen to its magic spell.
But his memory is eternal as the
hills themselves.</p>

<h3>MARIA IMMACOLATA OF BOURBON.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></h3>

<p>We still see her, a gentle and
beautiful girl of fourteen, seated
beside her brother, the exiled King
of Naples, in a low carriage which
passes through the Villa Borghese,
in Rome. Her face is of the Bourbon
mould. A fair, open forehead,
doubly suggestive of the water-lily,
because of its snowy whiteness and
the innocent frankness with which
it seems to turn towards heaven.
Bright hazel eyes, the limpid, loving
depths of which are expressive
of the innocence and purity of the
soul, which gives them life and
light; while the lines of her chaste
mouth and finely-chiselled chin are
ever forming themselves into a subdued
smile of love, of peace, and
of quiet resignation. There is a
modesty, and withal an elegance
in her dress and carriage, which
strike the beholder at once. Her
eyes do not wander about, but
are fixed with trusting tenderness
on the face of her brother, or rest
affectionately upon the beautiful
greyhound which crouches at her
feet and looks up at her with an
earnestness almost human. It may
have been a mere fancy of ours,
founded on our knowledge of the
history of that lovely creature; but
it always seemed to us that the
earnest look of the dog at its young
mistress was one of pity as well as
of affection&mdash;pity because she was
an exiled princess; affection, because
she was fair to behold and
gentle in demeanor, and the life-giving
spirit of both qualities was a
pure and noble soul, which we have
since learned to regard with a veneration
not unlike that which we
bear towards a saint. We do not
purpose to write her biography, nor
even her memoirs. We will merely
sketch briefly, and in the simplicity
with which they were narrated to
us, some recollections of that short
life of nineteen years which wrought
a chastening and ennobling influence
upon all whose happiness it
was to be near her.</p>

<p>Maria Immacolata Aloysia of
Bourbon was the youngest child but
one of Ferdinand II., King of Naples,
and Maria Theresa of Austria,
his second wife, and was born in the
castle of Caserta, on the 21st of January,
1855. Her father the king
died when she was quite young,
and was succeeded on the throne
by Francis II., the first-born of his
marriage with the saintly Maria
Christina of Savoy. After the
death of Ferdinand, the Queen-Mother,
Maria Theresa, devoted
all her energies to the religious and
secular education of her four children,
the Princess Maria Pia;
Prince Don Pasquale, Count of
Bari; the subject of this sketch,
Princess Maria Immacolata, and
Prince Don Gennarino, Count of
Caltagirone. In doing this she was
actuated by a strong sense of the
obligations of a Christian mother
towards her children, while she felt
that in discharging these obligations
with fidelity she paid a worthy
tribute to the memory of her deceased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[671]</a></span>
consort. Maria Immacolata,
even in childhood, showed
herself worthy of the sweet name
which was given her in baptism,
and the name of Aloysia was
peculiarly becoming to her; for as
S. Aloysius was called “the Angel
of the Court of Mantua,” so did her
sweet and angelic disposition win
for her the appellation of “Angel
of the Court of Naples.” Naples,
however, was not destined to possess
its “angel” long. The sad
history of the treacherous expulsion
of Francis II. by his own first
cousin, Victor Emanuel, is too well
known to need recital here. Enough
to say, that in 1861 the Bourbons
were forced to fly from the fortress
of Gaeta and seek refuge in Rome,
which was still the home of the
exile, the weary, and the world-worn.
As their father Ferdinand
had offered an asylum to Pius IX.
when the revolution of 1848 drove
him from Rome, so now the noble
heart of the Pontiff sympathized
with the exiles, and he forthwith
ordered the Quirinal Palace to be
prepared for their reception. King
Francis soon after took up his
residence in the Farnese Palace,
and the Queen-Mother retired with
her four children to Palazzo Nipoti.
It is into this sanctuary of piety,
order, and industry that we would
introduce the reader, that he may
admire with us the domestic virtues
of that Christian mother Maria
Theresa. All is order, tranquillity,
and modesty. Each prince has his
own separate apartment and his
own instructors. The hours for
retiring to bed at night, rising in
the morning, for prayers, Mass,
study, meals, and recreation are
regularly established. Besides the
ordinary exercises of piety, there is
a religious instruction given once
a week, and a spiritual retreat once
a year, at which the queen herself
and every member of her household
assist. She is the ruling and guiding
spirit of all, and it was but
natural, under the influence of
such a perfect model, that the children
should soon give evidences of
those rare qualities of mind and
soul which, in later years, became
the theme of general admiration.
Such was the domestic life of the
exiles. It was here that the character
of Maria Immacolata began to
develop itself with singular beauty.
Naturally pious, she loved God
tenderly. At the religious instructions
she observed a gravity of
demeanor rarely met with in a
child of her years, and on retiring
to her room, she used to note down
upon a slip of paper the principal
points in the discourse which she
had just heard. Her temperament
was a lively one, and no one enjoyed
the hours of recreation more
heartily than she did. Yet it was
apparent to all as she grew up that
she was struggling hard to obtain a
perfect mastery over herself, and
the success which attended her
efforts was especially manifest in
her affectionate obedience to the
queen, to her elder brothers and
sister. The sweetest little nook in
the Nipoti Palace was the room of
Maria Immacolata. It was so
small, so neat, so orderly, and the
little altar in one corner, surmounted
by a statuette of the Immaculate
Conception, and ornamented with
sweet-smelling flowers, told more
plainly than words could who was
the occupant. During the month
of May her room became a little
Eden of flowers in honor of the
Virgin Mary. But other flowers
were offered up to Our Lady which
were far more acceptable to her
than the fairest flowers of earth.
On the altar stood a little vase of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[672]</a></span>
porphyry, containing a number
of slips of paper, upon which was
written the name of some virtue,
some act of charity to be performed,
or little mortification to be
practised. Every morning, she
and her sister, Maria Pia, repaired
together to this urn, and, with joy
depicted in their countenances,
each drew out a slip of paper. Immacolata
was always wont to say,
when she had read her slip of
paper, “O mamma! I need this
virtue so much.” It has been said
that love is ingenious; and if this
be true of that love which creatures,
following a God-given instinct,
bear one towards another, it must
find a proportionately more beautiful
application in the love which
a pure creature of the earth cherishes
for the Immaculate Queen of
Heaven. Maria Immacolata and
her sister were not content with
practising daily the virtues named
on each slip of paper, but on the
last day of the month they collected
all the slips of paper together,
and, with the addition of some
lilies, they wove them into a chaplet,
with which they crowned the
statue of their Queen. The idea
had a doubly beautiful significance,
being suggestive at once of purity
of heart and the traditional love
of the Bourbons for the lily. The
young princess was scarcely eleven
years of age when she was told, to
her unutterable delight, that she
might prepare to receive her First
Communion. In this event of her
life our admiration is divided between
the solicitous care of her
noble mother in preparing her
daughter for a worthy reception of
the Blessed Eucharist, and the holy
readiness and thorough spirit of
appreciation with which the child
performed all that was enjoined
upon her. In order to remove
every possible occasion of distraction
during the spiritual retreat
of eight days, which she made in
the palace under the direction of
a Jesuit father, she sent all her toys
to a conservatory of little girls, and
on the day previous to her beginning
the exercises, she was overheard
to say to a parrot, of which
she was very fond, “Bird, you and
I must part for awhile; a great
Visitor is coming, and I must prepare
to receive him.” She went so
far as to deny herself the cup of
chicken-broth which she was in
the habit of taking in the morning,
because of her delicate constitution.
During the retreat she prayed most
fervently to S. Aloysius, to whom
she was tenderly devoted, beseeching
him to obtain for her the grace
of overcoming the enemies of her
soul&mdash;the world, the passions, and
the demon. After her death, a slip
of paper was found in her prayer-book,
upon which she had noted
down all that she intended to ask
our Lord for at her First Communion.
She seems to have been
strongly attached to her governess,
for she writes: “and I will pray for
Maria Laserre, that she may never
be separated from me; and I will
also pray,” said the child, “for
Victor Emanuel, that God may enlighten
him and pardon him all the
harm he has done to us.” The
first prayer received a gracious
hearing, and we find Maria Laserre
her constant and cheerful companion
in all the trials and vicissitudes
to which that short and guileless
life was afterward subject. The
other prayer reveals a sensitive
soul, which was penetrated to its
depths with a full and saddening
consciousness of the monstrous
wrongs which her family had suffered
from their disloyal cousin, and
at the same time a generous, forgiving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[673]</a></span>
spirit, not unlike that which
prompted the touching prayer of
Christ upon the cross, “Father!
forgive them.” Many a noble deed
is recorded of the Bourbons when
they were in power, when the <i lang="fr">fleur-de-lis</i>
was the emblem of a glorious
reality; but there is a sublimity of
pathos in the forgiving prayer of
the delicate child of eleven, despoiled
of every vestige of royalty
but her princely name, which is far
beyond our appreciation, and is
only justly estimated by Him who
taught us to forgive the trespasses
of others if we would hope for the
forgiveness of our own. For all
the favors which she asked of S.
Aloysius she promised to give him
a clasp of diamonds, which she
had received from the king her father.
Her anxiety, however, was
great lest her mother might not
consent to her parting with such a
precious souvenir, as will appear
in the letters which she wrote to
the saint during the retreat, and
which were found after her death
in a small silver purse which she
carried about with her. They are
written in elegant French. As they
were never intended for mortal
eyes, but were addressed in all innocence
and simplicity to a saint in
heaven, we take them up with all
possible delicacy, and reverence
for the chaste heart of which they
were the candid outpouring. While
they bear testimony to her purity
of soul, they are also an evidence
of what religion was to her&mdash;not a
hard, galling yoke, which must be
borne from sheer necessity, nor a
heavy burden, to be carried only on
a Sunday or a holyday. No, there
was an every-day warmth in her religion;
it was something near at
hand, familiar, consoling, and refreshing,
and nowhere more perfectly
embodied than in the short
definition of the Redeemer: “My
yoke is sweet, and my burden light.”
Here is one of her letters:</p>

<p>“O great saint! who never lost
your innocence, and who by your
sanctity brought so much glory and
honor upon your mother; S. Aloysius
Gonzaga, patron of the young,
you who were possessed of a great
knowledge of the world and of
human frailty, I recommend myself
to you, that, by your intercession
with Jesus Christ our Lord,
you obtain for me the grace that
I too may make a good First Communion.
S. Aloysius Gonzaga! you
who knew so well how to make a
First Communion, oh! grant that
the First Communion may be for
me the beginning of a new life,
the rule and guide of all my actions;
and that I too may begin to
battle courageously with the world,
the demon, and my own passions.
Grant me this favor, O great
Saint! Meanwhile, I choose thee
for my protector, and I will recommend
myself to thee every day, in
every sorrowful trial, at every suggestion
of the enemy, and in every
instance of impatience; and when
temptation assails me, I will say a
Gloria Patri for thee.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Maria Immacolata of Bourbon</span> (great sinner).</p>

<p>“<i>Postscript.</i>&mdash;Pray for me, O great
Saint! and obtain for me these
graces. Glory be to God the Father!
O my S. Aloysius Gonzaga!
pray that mamma will permit me
without hesitation to carry as a gift
to your chapel that little clasp of
diamonds, and give me light to
know how to ask her well for the
favor, and how to reply, if she
makes any objection.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">The Great Sinner.</span>”</p>

<p>Another letter is couched in
these terms:</p>

<p>“O S. Aloysius Gonzaga! you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[674]</a></span>
see that I recommend myself to
you every day, as I promised you.
Now, obtain this grace for me, that
mamma may look at me with a
good face when I ask her for the
cope for Father N., of your own
society; but especially when I ask
her for the first favor (permission
to bestow the diamonds upon S.
Aloysius), that she may say yes
without hesitating; and that she
may also allow me to give my photograph
to Don Domenico (an old
domestic in the family). But let
mamma say <em>yes</em> without difficulty.
I ask you earnestly. Glory be to
the Father.”</p>

<p>Here is another precious document:</p>

<p>“O S. Aloysius! my protector,
I again recommend myself to thee.
Give me light and obtain for me
the grace that I may make my
First Communion well. O happy
day! O day that comes but once!
O thrice happy day! Great Saint!
give me thy faith, give me the faith
of all the saints. Pray that I may
not be ashamed to confess my sins.
Meanwhile, I am thankful to thee
for the favor which thou hast granted
me in the clasp of diamonds,
and for other favors, which I received
from thee on other occasions.
Pray for the most humble
servant of God.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">M. I. of B.</span> (great sinner).</p>

<p>“<i>Postscript.</i>&mdash;I recommend myself
to thee, my dear protector; do
me this favor: ask God to pardon
me.”</p>

<p>The “thrice happy day” came at
last, and on the 24th of December,
1865, she received Holy Communion
from the hands of Cardinal Riario
Sforza, in the same chapel in which
her “dear Protector,” S. Aloysius,
pronounced his vows. This chapel
is in the Roman College, where
S. Aloysius lived and died. It was
beautifully ornamented for the occasion,
and, besides the king,
queen, and queen-mother, with
their suites, a number of distinguished
persons were present, and
a score of little girls, dressed in
white, assisted at the Mass, bearing
lighted tapers in their hands.
Every eye rested on Maria Immacolata,
whose recollection edified
all present. The smile which
played around her mouth, and the
blush which mantled her cheeks,
were but faint indications of the
happiness in her soul. What passed
in that abode of purity and innocence
is known only to herself
and Him whom she loved. We
can only narrate what we saw.
Having obtained permission, she
repaired with her governess, after
thanksgiving, to the room of S.
Aloysius, and with a face all aglow
with joy, she placed a little casket
on the altar. It was the clasp of
diamonds. On leaving the room
of the saint, she remarked to her
companion that she was overwhelmed
with gratitude towards
God. “I must make him a present;”
and before the day was over
she had bestowed every coin in her
purse upon his poor. Only one
piece of gold was reserved, and
that she sent on the following day
to a conservatory, to clothe a little
orphan girl of her own age, who
was preparing for her First Communion.
But of her boundless
charity we will have more to say
anon.</p>

<p>The summer of 1867 found the
royal exiles at Albano, a charming
country resort on the Appian Way,
about fifteen miles from Rome.
They had not been there long
when the Asiatic cholera broke
out with a violence unprecedented
in the history of that terrible
plague. The victims daily were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[675]</a></span>
numbered by hundreds. Not a
family in the city was spared.</p>

<p>The first victim in the Bourbon
family was the young Prince Gennarino,
a bright little boy of eight
years. At the first symptoms of
the malady he asked for his confessor,
and confessed with such
compunction of heart that the good
priest was moved to tears. He
begged earnestly that he might receive
Holy Communion; “for,”
said the little fellow, “I want to
die like a man.” Though he was
so young, his request was granted.
His First Communion was his
Viaticum, and “like a man” the
young Bourbon passed to another
life. But death had singled out a
more illustrious victim in the person
of Maria Theresa, the Queen-Mother.
Her whole life having
been one of preparation, her death
was that of the just. And here we
would willingly stop to admire the
character of that noble Christian
mother, and worthy descendant of
the great Maria Theresa of Austria;
but we are restrained from doing
so by the reflection that we cannot
pay a more worthy or glowing tribute
to her memory, than by sketching
the life and character of her
saintly daughter Maria Immacolata.
To a heart so sensitive, so
appreciative and affectionate, as was
that of Immacolata, the death of a
mother was a great blow, and it was
a long time before she could be
comforted. King Francis now
became the natural protector of the
orphans, and took them to his own
residence in the Farnese Palace, in
Rome. The habit of study had
already been formed in the children
by their saintly mother, and so
they applied themselves with renewed
vigor to the acquisition of
knowledge. Maria Immacolata was
gifted with talents of the highest
order. Besides speaking her own
language with captivating sweetness
she spoke French and German
fluently, and the facility with which
she could pass from one language
to another was surprising. Drawing
was her passion, and her
sketches in oil and water colors
gave evidence of no inconsiderable
genius. Wherever she went, she
brought her drawing materials with
her, and amused herself by sketching
landscapes, palaces, villas, and
the like. She was equally skilled
in portraits, and the last production
of her pencil, a beautiful picture of
the Immaculate Heart, has been
very much admired. Literature
was another source of pleasure to
her. Though she had a lofty appreciation
of the beauties of the
Italian language, and was passionately
fond of reading, she was never
known to indulge in light and promiscuous
literature. While applying
herself to the cultivation of her
mind, she did not forget the more
modest accomplishments which become
her sex; and there are several
beggars in Rome this day who will
show, with no small pride, the
coarse stockings which were knitted
for them by the tiny hands
of Maria Immacolata of Bourbon.
But these and many other accomplishments
were but as the gold
which encircles a diamond of rare
value and purity. Her richest
treasure was her humility and
modesty. Her conversation, though
entertaining and lively, was modest;
her deportment, though easy and
graceful, equally so. The sweetness
of her disposition was especially
noticeable in her treatment of
domestics.</p>

<p>In the October of 1867 the Eternal
City was thrown into a state of
excitement and trepidation by the
news that Garibaldi, with his horde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[676]</a></span>
of desperadoes, was on the march
for Rome. The little army of the
Pope prepared to make a gallant
defence, and a number of chivalrous
Roman youths of the best
families offered themselves to swell
the ranks of the Papal legions.
Francis II. and his two brothers
were among the first to rush to the
defence of the country&mdash;the only
country which was now left them.
Their two orphan sisters, Maria Pia
and Maria Immacolata, were consequently
left alone in the Farnese Palace.
They did not remain long unprotected,
for the Holy Father sent
for the two princesses, and had them
brought into the Vatican, where
the magnificent apartment of the
Countess Mathilde had been prepared
for them. Here they remained
until after the battle of Mentana,
and the Papal troops returned in
triumph to the city. While the
children were in the Vatican, they
assisted every morning at the Pope’s
Mass, and received Holy Communion
daily from his hands. Every
day, when he went to take his usual
walk through the galleries and
corridors of the palace, he sent for
the orphans, and by his sweet and
consoling conversation made them
forget the anxiety which tortured
them about their brothers. During
those days&mdash;the happiest of her life&mdash;Maria
Pia conceived a veneration
and love for the Holy Father which
she cherished ever afterwards, and
which, we may here remark, was
characteristic of her mother, Maria
Theresa. When the storm had
blown over, the orphans returned
to the Farnese Palace, and resumed
their usually quiet and retired life.
It did not last long. This time it
was not the Garibaldian hordes
that marched upon the city, but the
well-disciplined troops of a king
who called himself “the dutiful son
of Pius IX.” To be brief, the year
1870 was one of woe to the Romans,
but to none was it more sorrowful
than to the poor persecuted
Bourbons. Once more they were
forced to fly, and in their flight the
noble family was obliged to divide
itself. Some of them fled into Bavaria,
some to France, while Maria
Immacolata went with her sister,
now Duchess of Parma, into the
Tyrol, and afterwards to Cannes,
on the confines of France. She
was accompanied by her governess
Maria Laserre, her faithful friend
and comforter in every trial.</p>

<p>But the cold climate of the mountains
was too severe for Immacolata.
She was a frail, delicate flower,
and under the rough, inclement
blasts of a northern winter she began
to wilt away. What with her
weak health and her strong affection
for the Holy Father, she began
to pine for Rome, her country, as
she called it. All this passed within
her own bosom. For the rest,
she was patient, resigned, and more
forgiving than ever towards those
who were the cause of her exile,
first from the land of her birth, and
afterwards from Rome, to which
her heart clung most lovingly. A
soul so closely united to God as
was hers, soon found the wherewithal
to comfort her, and it was with
a smile of heavenly joy in her countenance
that she brightened up and
said to her maid, “Ah! well, there
is one consolation left me: the poor
I have always with me.” From
her infancy she had been noted for
her charities. What little she possessed
in childhood she gave to the
poor joyfully. When she grew up
and received a monthly allowance
from her mother for ordinary expenses,
she gave with such a liberal
hand that her allowance used to be
exhausted long before the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[677]</a></span>
the month came. The Queen-Mother
had become so accustomed to
the charitable prodigalities of her
daughter that she used to say when
she would hear a modest knock at
her door, about the 20th of each
month, “Here comes my little prodigal
daughter; but, God bless her!
she has not wasted her substance.”
When the Queen died, and Maria
Immacolata came into her inheritance,
her charity was more a profusion
than a giving; and it was remarked
that no one knew anything
of her charities. The gospel directed
her to give in secret, and the
Holy Spirit assured her that the
“Father who seeth in secret” would
reward her. It was her chief delight,
when she went out to take a
walk, to gather the young people
around her, and ask them the catechism,
and teach them how to pray;
and in order to stimulate them to
study the catechism thoroughly,
she would give them rosaries, medals,
and pictures, which she had
sent to her at regular intervals from
Rome. Whenever she met any one
who was on the way to the Eternal
City, she could not restrain her tears,
as she thought of the happiness
which was denied to herself; and,
she would often remark, “It is <em>so</em>
cold here, that not only the body,
but the soul too shivers for that
warmth which can only be felt near
the Vicar of Christ.”</p>

<p>About this time she became acquainted
with Henry Bourbon,
Count of Bardi, son of Charles III.
of Parma, and nephew of the Count
of Chambord. Her sister, Maria Pia,
had already been married to Robert,
Duke of Parma, and the nuptial
blessing was pronounced by the
Holy Father, in the year 1869. As
her sister’s marriage was one of
Christian love, not of political or
worldly interest, contracted under
the influence of religion, and not to
keep up the “equilibrium of relationship,”
as the saying is in Europe,
so was the marriage of Immacolata
with the Count of Bardi.
Among other motives in favor of
accepting his hand in marriage she
was wont to adduce this one, that
the fact of his having been educated
in the college of the Jesuits at
Feldkirch was an assurance to her
that her marriage would be a happy
one. As she had prepared herself
for the reception of her First Communion,
so by recollection and
spiritual exercises did she dispose
herself for the Sacrament of Matrimony,
and on the 27th of November,
1873, she became the Countess
of Bardi. The marriage was a
modest celebration throughout.
The domestics of the family and
the poor of the city were the only
merrymakers. As for the young
spouses, they were destined only to
drink the cup of tribulation. The
lily of Bourbon was fast drooping,
the color was fading from her
cheeks, and the unnatural brilliancy
of her eyes told, more clearly than
words could, that Immacolata was
not destined to live much longer.
No one knew this better than herself.
Still she was resolved to do
her duty, as if she had long years
before her. She began by studying
the character of her husband.
Prior to all, however, she had marked
out for herself a simple line of
conduct, which she couched in the
two words, “affectionate submission.”
In the heaven-given light
of this resolution, she loved him,
and by its influence and the discharge
of all those kind and endearing
offices which are the noble
prerogatives of the gentler sex, she
won his confidence, and strengthened
his affection, as with a wall of
granite. Having acquired a thorough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[678]</a></span>
knowledge of his character,
she anticipated every desire of his,
and executed his every wish with
such readiness that he was afterwards
known to say that he could
not decide whose wish she accomplished,
his or her own. In this
way she obtained great influence
over him, but she only exercised it
in the things of God. Wherever
she knelt down to pray, there he
knelt at her side. When she was
gone to her rest, he was heard to
say of her, “She took me by the
hand, and led me to God.”</p>

<p>On the day after their marriage
the young spouses set out on a
journey to Egypt. The voyage
was long and ill-suited to her delicate
constitution; but she went
cheerfully, thinking not of herself,
but only how she might please her
consort. During the forty days
they were sailing up the Nile, she
lay prostrate with a malignant fever,
which, together with the ravages
of consumption, reduced her almost
to the last extremity. It was hoped
that she would rally during their
voyage in Upper Egypt, but in
vain. When they arrived there,
she became weaker and weaker,
until, finally, the most they hoped
for was that she might live until
their return to France. Setting
sail from Cairo, they arrived at
Marseilles in the March of 1874,
where she rallied at the sight of
her sister, Maria Pia, and her beloved
governess, Maria Laserre,
who had come to meet her. In a
consultation of her physicians, it
was resolved to bring her to Cauterets,
a little village in the Upper
Pyrenees, and celebrated for its
sulphur baths. Maria Immacolata
was delighted with the proposal, not
because she hoped for any relief
from the waters of Cauterets, but
because in their journey thither
they would pass Lourdes, to which
she had long yearned to make a
pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Accordingly, they set out for
Cauterets, stopping at Lourdes on
the way. The weary invalid’s heart
throbbed with joy as she knelt for
the first time in the holy grotto.
For two whole hours she remained
absorbed in silent prayer, giving no
other sign of life than the long and
affectionate gaze which she fixed
upon the image of Our Lady.
During their stay at Lourdes, she
visited the grotto twice every day,
and at each visit she prayed long
and fervently. Twice she insisted
on being immersed in the water,
notwithstanding it was exceedingly
cold. On being asked what she
prayed for, she replied, “That
God’s will be done.” The waters
of Cauterets gave her no relief.
The disease had taken deep root in
her system, and was rapidly advancing
to a fatal termination. An eminent
physician was called from the
city of Pau, who gave it as his opinion
that it was useless to hope for her
recovery. She might live for fifteen
days more, and possibly might linger
on for a month. The young
count thought no longer of the
great loss he was about to suffer,
but only how he might make the
remaining days of her short life as
quiet and devoid of pain as possible.
It was resolved to bring her
to Pau, the principal city of the
Lower Pyrenees, where she would
receive better attendance, and,
above all, have the consolations of
her religion. As they carried her
on a species of litter from the hotel
to the carriage, she said to her husband,
“Not long ago I could move
about with ease; afterwards they
carried me in an arm-chair; now
it is a litter; the next will be a bier.”
Her sufferings on the road between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[679]</a></span>
Lourdes and Pau were very great,
but she bore them cheerfully, and
only prayed that they would let her
die in Pau. After their arrival in
that city, she rallied a little, and
her husband tried to raise her hopes
by saying that she would recover.
“Do not be deceived, dear Henry,”
she said; “before another month
passes away I shall be gone. Bring
me a confessor.” One of the Jesuit
fathers came immediately, and her
first prayer was that they would
erect an altar in her room at which
Mass might be said on the following
day. Meanwhile, she prepared
to make a general confession of her
whole life, and begged every one in
the house to pray for her. Her
first care was to fulfil a number of
promises which she had made to
the Madonna, and calling her husband
to her bedside, she begged
of him to make them good. Her
jewels, wedding-dress, and crown
had already been promised to Our
Lady of Issoudun. After her
death, the Duke of Parma and the
Duchess, her sister, repaired to that
sanctuary and made the offering.
She had also vowed a silver heart
to Our Lady of Einsiedeln, and a
set of vestments to Our Lady of
Lourdes. She had begun to embroider
the chasuble herself, but
was obliged from sheer weakness to
lay it aside. She begged her sister
to finish it, and carry it in her
name to the holy grotto. In addition
to these, she had also vowed
to have two hundred Masses celebrated
for the suffering souls in
purgatory. Opening her purse to
fulfil this promise, she found it
empty. Indeed, that was its normal
condition, and it was said of her
that a heavy purse never wore a
hole in her pocket. She asked her
husband, with child-like simplicity,
to give her six hundred francs,
and having received them, ordered
the sum to be distributed among
the churches in the city according
to her intention. On the following
day, the 20th of August, she confessed
and received Holy Communion
with edifying fervor. Her only
desire now was to remain quiet,
that she might commune with God
and prepare for her final departure.
On the day mentioned, she was
visited by Margherita, the wife of
Don Carlos. But the dying princess
turned her eyes lovingly on
the visitor and said, “Pardon me,
Margherita, but I must be alone
with God.” The Princess Maria
Pia and her governess remained by
her bedside constantly, and prayed
aloud with her. When her confessor
entered the room she would
say to him, “Must I live many days
longer? Pray God not to tarry.”
Then she would chide herself for a
want of resignation, and say, “As
thou wilt!”</p>

<p>It was no difficult task for one
whose heart was detached from the
things of this world to make a will,
and that of the Princess Immacolata
of Bourbon did not give her
much anxiety. Still, she observed
the legal formalities, and showed
such clearness and precision in her
dictation to the notary as surprised
all present. With the exception
of that part of the will
which affects her natural heirs, the
rest is but one long series of donations
for religious purposes&mdash;foreign
missions, religious houses, orphanages,
and the like. She was not
content with making a handsome
provision for each of her domestics,
but even made appropriations
for their relatives. The poor are
called in the will “my dearest
heirs,” and to these, she left the
sum of 20,000 francs in gold, the
distribution of which she entrusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[680]</a></span>
to her governess, Maria Laserre,
begging her especially not to forget
the poor families she knew in
Rome, and elsewhere, during her
wanderings. In short, after disposing
of the enormous sum of
107,000 francs in gold, to be bestowed
in Christian charity, this
generous soul concludes her will
in these terms: “I intend, moreover,
that what remains, over and
above, of my capital be all expended
in purchasing sacred vessels
and vestments for poor churches.”
This last provision has already
passed into effect, to our personal
knowledge. Among the many
charitable institutions which Rome
possesses there is one whose members
devote themselves especially
to making vestments and procuring
sacred vessels for poor churches.
We know of one, composed
of some eminent French ladies,
who make it their duty to provide
for the poor churches of Italy;
only a short time ago, they exhibited
a splendid assortment of vestments
and church furniture, mostly
all purchased on the strength of
the donation of Maria Immacolata
of Bourbon.</p>

<p>And now, having removed every
earthly care from her mind, Maria
Immacolata disposed herself to receive
the Sacrament of Extreme
Unction. She begged her confessor
to read aloud from some ascetic
work, that her soul might
be drawn more closely to God.
When he had read for awhile, she
said, “Now I am ready,” and in
the presence of her brother the
Count of Bari, her sister the Duchess
of Parma, the Princess Margherita,
wife of Don Carlos, and
her beloved governess, she received
the last sacrament. It was then
that her confessor informed her
that the following day, August
23d, was the Feast of the Immaculate
Heart of Mary, whereat
she besought all present to pray
that she might obtain the singular
favor from God of dying on that
day and of receiving the Holy
Eucharist once more; and with the
holy simplicity and fervor of her
childhood, she recited aloud the
following prayer: “Most Holy
Virgin, I resign myself to suffer
still more for your honor, and the
glory of your divine Son. O my
Mother! you who have permitted
your daughter to bear your own
sweet name of Immacolata, obtain for
me the grace to receive once more
the most Sacred Body of your divine
Son, and to die on the Feast
of your Immaculate Heart.” Both
favors were granted. On the following
day, Mass was celebrated in
her room, and she received her
Lord for the last time. Her husband
also, her brother Count of
Bari, the Duke and Duchess of
Parma, the Princess Margherita,
and all her maids and domestics,
communicated. It was a touching
scene that transpired after
Mass, when the whole household
gathered around the bed of
the dying princess, and asked her
blessing. A smile of angelic delight
mantled her face, and, as she
said herself, her soul seemed to be
inundated with consolation. She
no longer felt the oppression and
pain which had tortured her an
hour previous. Her sister Maria
Pia, desirous of having a precious
remembrance in after-life, held her
own photograph to her lips, that
she might imprint a kiss upon it.
When she had kissed it, she asked
for a pen, and wrote upon the card,
in a trembling hand, “Living or
dead, I shall always be near thee.
Thy own Maria Immacolata”; and
on the photograph which her governess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[681]</a></span>
presented to her, she wrote,
“In heaven and on earth I shall
never have but one heart with you.
Your little Mistress.”</p>

<p>Calling every one of her domestics
to the bedside, she gave each a
souvenir of herself, accompanied
with a few words of wise counsel.
Turning then to the princes her
brothers, her sister, and her brother-in-law,
she besought them to live together
in harmony, and to love one
another for her sake. She then asked
for her jewels, and choosing a
ring, she put it on the finger of
Margherita of Spain; another precious
ring she put on the finger of
her sister, and a third upon that of
her governess. While doing this, she
asked them to pray that she might
be pardoned for the vanity of wearing
those ornaments. She asked
pardon three successive times of
her maid, Maria Grazia, for all the
annoyance she had ever given her,
and taking another ring from her
own finger, she held it out saying,
“This is for your sister Francesca
in Naples, of whom I ask pardon
from afar.” But the Duchess of
Parma had still one favor to ask&mdash;a
blessing for her four little children
in the Castle of Wartegg, in Switzerland.
The dying sister answered,
“Yes, I will pray for them in heaven,”
and pronouncing the name
of each she kissed the Crucifix and
blessed them. The apostolic Benediction
of His Holiness had already
been sent to her, and now a
second arrived, and with it the
plenary indulgence <em>in the hour of
death</em>. This was followed by a despatch
from the Comte de Chambord
which said, “We are in great affliction,
and are praying.” While
all this was passing, her eyes rested
upon the form of her husband, who
knelt by her side. But recollecting
herself, she said, “My Madonna
for Mademoiselle”&mdash;meaning her
governess. “Now,” said she, “I
have naught to give away but my
soul, and that I give to God.”
Turning to her young husband,
she said, “Henry! O my Henry!
I leave thee, to go where I am
called by that God who made
us companions for a few short
months on earth; but I leave
thee in good hands”; and holding
in her right hand the crucifix
and her rosary, and inclining her
head towards a statue of the
Blessed Virgin, as if saluting her,
and recommending to her care
him who knelt there in sorrow, she
died.</p>

<h3>NOTRE DAME DE LOURDES.</h3>

<p class="center smaller">“THOU WEL OF MERCY, SINFUL SOULES CURE.”&mdash;CHAUCER.</p>

<p>Lourdes, apart from any religious
interest, is well worth a visit,
for it is an old historic place. “Bigerronum
arx antiqua fuit Luparda,
quæ nunc Lourda est,” says Julius
Scaliger. It is associated with the
Romans, the Moors, the paladins
of Charlemagne, and the flower of
French and English chivalry, and
is celebrated by Gregory of Tours,
Froissart, Monstrelet, and all the
ancient chroniclers of the land.
Situated at the entrance of the seven
valleys of the Lavedan on the
one side, and the rich sunny plains
of Béarn on the other, under a sky
as soft and bright as that of Italy,
it is as attractive to the eye of the
tourist as to the soul of the archæologist
and the pilgrim.</p>

<p>We arrived at Lourdes in less
than an hour after leaving Tarbes.
The station is some distance from
town, and at least a mile from the
world-famous grotto; but there
are always hacks and omnibuses
eager to take the visitor to one of
the numerous hotels. The depot
is encumbered with luggage and
crowded with pilgrims going and
coming, and on the side tracks are
long trains of empty cars that tell
of the importance of the station&mdash;an
importance solely due to the immense
number of pilgrims, who
sometimes amount to five hundred
thousand a year.</p>

<p>On leaving the station, one naturally
looks around to discover the
renowned sanctuary of Notre Dame
de Lourdes, but not a glimpse of it
is to be seen. Nothing meets the
eye but a gray picturesque town
shut in by the outlying Pyrenees.
Nothing could be lovelier than the
fresh green valley in which it stands,
framed by hills whose sides are
blackened with <i lang="fr">débris</i> from the immense
quarries of slate. It is only
a pleasant walk to the town in good
weather, which gives one an opportunity
of taking in the features of
the charming landscape. Flowers
bloom in the hedge-rows, elms and
ash-trees dot the grassy meadows,
the hillsides beneath the quarries
are luxuriant with vineyards and
fields of waving grain. The way is
lively with hurrying pilgrims, all
intent on their own business and
regardless of you; some saying
their rosaries, others in a band singing
some pious hymn, and many
solitary ones absorbed in their own
reflections.</p>

<p>We soon reach the town. The
houses are of stone with slated
roofs. Nearly every one is a hotel,
or a lodging-house, or a shop for
the sale of religious objects. The
windows are full of rosaries, medallions
inscribed with the words of
the Virgin to Bernadette, miniature
grottos, photographs&mdash;in short,
everything that can recall the
wonderful history of the grotto
of Massabielle. The very silk
kerchiefs in the windows, such as
the peasants wear on their heads,
are stamped with the Virgin in her
niche. The old part of the town
has narrow streets, without any
sidewalks, paved with cobble-stones
quite in harmony with the penitential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[683]</a></span>
spirit of a true pilgrim. They
are mere lanes, fearful in muddy
weather when crowded with people
in danger at every step from the
carriages.</p>

<p>The Hotel de la Grotte is the
nearest to the church of Notre
Dame de Lourdes, and very pleasantly
situated at a convenient walking
distance from it. At one of
our visits to the place, we stopped
at the Hotel des Pyrénées in the
heart of the town, where we were
made very comfortable; but the
second time, it was in the height
of the season, and there was not a
room to be had in any of the hotels,
and had we not providentially
stumbled on a friend with a vacant
room at his command, we might
have been forced to spend the
night in the church&mdash;no great penance,
to be sure, in so heavenly a
place, where Masses begin at midnight
and do not cease till afternoon.
The only safe way is to secure
rooms beforehand, especially
when the place is most frequented.</p>

<p>Lourdes is a small town of about
five thousand inhabitants, mostly
workers in marble, slate, etc., that
is, those who do not keep a hotel,
or a <i lang="fr">café</i>, or a shop of some kind;
for the good people seem quite
ready to avail themselves of every
opportunity of benefiting by the
piety that brings so many strangers
among them. They are shrewd,
quick-witted, upright, and kind-hearted;
attached to their ancient
traditions, and firm in their faith
as their rock-built houses. They
have always been characterized by
their devotion to the Blessed Virgin.
Five of the chapels in the
parish church are dedicated to her
honor. The confraternities of the
Scapular and the Rosary are flourishing,
and the congregation of the
Enfants de Marie is one of the
oldest in the country. The dark-eyed
women of Lourdes have a
Spanish look, and are quite picturesque
in their scarlet capulets or
black capuchins, but the men have
mostly laid aside the Bigorrais
cloak, once so sought after that
they were exported from the country,
and mentioned by learned men.
Pope Gregory I., in a letter to Eulogius,
Bishop of Alexandria, thus
alludes to them: “Sex minora
Aquitanica pallia.” S. Paulinus
of Nola, in a letter to Ausonius,
says: “Dignaque pellitis habitas deserta
Bigerris.” “Bigerricam vestem,
brevem atque hispidam,” says
Sulpicius Severus. And the poet
Fortunatus, in his life of S. Martin,
says: “Induitur sanctus hirsuta
Bigerrica palla.”</p>

<p>These <em>Marlottes</em>, as Scaliger calls
them, are now mostly confined to
the mountaineers who cling to the
old ways. The people of the valley,
however, have not laid aside
all their old prejudices with their
cloaks. The natives of Lourdes
are said to hold in proud disdain
those who have had the disadvantage
of being born elsewhere, in
proof of which it is related that a
prisoner of state, named Soulié,
once confined in the castle for some
offence, at last died from the effects
of his captivity. His fellow-prisoners,
desirous of showing him suitable
honor, as well as giving proper
expression to their own regret,
paid the bell-ringer to toll a bell
of the second class. It appears
there were four bells in use for
funerals; the first for the clergy;
the second, for the grandees of the
place; the third, for the common
citizen, and the fourth for the
poor. The inhabitants were so
enraged that such an honor as a
bell of the second class should be
rung for a stranger, that they condemned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[684]</a></span>
the guilty sexton to prison.
During his long confinement, he
was frequently heard exclaiming
with a groan: “Ah! detestable
<em>Soulié</em>! Had it only been a <i lang="fr">savate</i>,<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
I should not be here!”</p>

<p>This is a mere reminiscence of
their ancient glory. It is always
difficult to bring one’s self to the
level of fallen fortunes. The title
of stranger is still said to be an
original stain that nothing can ever
efface. Small and unpretending as
Lourdes may now seem, it has its
grand old memories. Its origin is
lost in the obscurity of remote
ages, but where history is at fault,
fable generally comes to the rescue.</p>

<p>The glory of founding Lourdes
is attributed to an Ethiopian princess.
Tarbis, queen of Ethiopia,
captivated by the valor and personal
attractions of Moses, offered
him her throne and hand.
Wounded and mortified at his refusal,
she abandoned her country
to hide her disappointment in the
obscurity of the Pyrenean valleys.
She founded the city of Tarbes,
and her sister Lorda that of
Lourdes.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages the Counts
of Bigorre were the Seigneurs of
Lourdes, and, like S. Louis under
the oak of Vincennes, they seated
themselves with patriarchal simplicity
on a stone bench under an
elm before the church to receive
the homage of their vassals. Notre
Dame de Bigorre! was then the
battle-cry of the people. Then, as
now, Mary was the Sovereign Lady
of the valley. To her its lords acknowledged
themselves vassals and
paid tribute, and the arms of the
town commemorate her miraculous
intervention to deliver it from the
hands of the Moors. But as this
legend is connected with the history
of the castle, we will give a brief
sketch of that once strong hold.</p>

<p>The tourist, on his way to Pau,
Cauteréts, St. Sauveur, or Bagnères,
as he traverses the plateau which
overlooks the fertile valley of the
Gave, sees an ancient fortress on
the top of an inaccessible cliff, that
rises straight up from the banks of
the river. This is the old citadel
of Lourdes, the key of the Seven
Valleys, the stronghold of the
Counts of Bigorre in the Middle
Ages. The eye of the traveller
cannot fail to be struck by the
antiquity of its gray battlements,
crenellated towers, and picturesque
situation, and he at once feels it
has a marvellous history.</p>

<p>The castle of Lourdes is more
than two thousand years old.
Here the ancient inhabitants long
held out against the attacks of the
Romans; and here, when they were
forced to yield, their conquerors
built the fortifications whose indestructible
foundation ages have
passed over without leaving any
trace. Several centuries later, the
castle of Mirambel, as it was
then called, was held by the Moors,
and their leader, Mirat, defended
it for a time against the
hosts of Charlemagne, and at
length, too haughty to yield to
any earthly power, surrendered
to the Queen of Heaven, who
wrought such a miracle of grace
on the proud painim’s heart that
he and all his followers went with
garlands of hay on their lances to
swear fealty to Notre Dame de
Puy, and resign all right to Mirambel.
Mirat was baptized by the
name of Lorus. He received the
honors of knighthood, and gave
the name of Lordum to the castle
he now held in the name of the
Virgin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[685]</a></span></p>

<p>We are indebted to an English
monk, named Marfin, for this legend,
and though rejected by many,
it was doubtless founded on the
popular traditions of the country,
which alone account for the arms
of the town and the annual tribute
the Counts of Bigorre paid to Notre
Dame de Puy as long as they
held possession of the castle.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p><i lang="fr">Lo ric castel de Lorda</i> having
been taken possession of by the
Albigenses in the XIIth century,
the celebrated Simon de Montfort
besieged it, but in vain. The
castle remained in their hands till
the end of the war.</p>

<p>No one of English origin can
look at the hoary walls of this ancient
fortress without the greatest
interest, for it is associated with
the memory of the Black Prince,
and the time was when the banner
of England floated from its towers
and defied the efforts of the
bravest knights of France to tear it
from its hold.</p>

<p>Lourdes, as well as the whole
province of Bigorre (which lay
between Béarn and Foix), fell into
the hands of the English by the
treaty of Bretagne, and constituted
a part of the Duchy of Aquitaine,
which Edward III. conferred on
his son, the Black Prince, who
left England to take possession of
his domains in 1363. He made
Bordeaux his capital, and there, in
the church of S. André, Jehan
Caubot, consul of Lourdes, and
the representatives of Tarbes and
other towns, presented themselves
at high noon before the most noble
and puissant Lord Edward, Prince
of Wales and Duke of Aquitaine,
and, in the presence of many lords,
knights, and citizens, swore fealty
to the English prince, beseeching
him to confirm the rights and franchises
which they had hitherto enjoyed,
which he solemnly promised.</p>

<p>The Count of Armagnac (John
I.) gave so captivating a description
of the beauty of Bigorre that
the Black Prince was induced to
visit his mountain province. He
remained for some time at Tarbes,
and while there explored the
neighboring valleys, strengthened
old fortresses and built several new
ones. He was particularly struck
with the castle of Lourdes, and the
advantage of holding such a position.
“It is the key of many countries,”
said he, “by which I can
find my way into Aragon, Catalonia,
and Barcelona.” He strengthened
its fortifications, and entrusted
the command to Pierre Arnaud
of Béarn, a cousin of Gaston Phœbus
of Foix, saying: “Master Arnaud,
I constitute and appoint you
captain of Lourdes, and warden of
Bigorre. See that you hold them,
and render a good account of your
trust to me and my father.”</p>

<p>Arnaud swore fealty to the Prince,
who soon after broke up his court
at Tarbes and returned to Bordeaux.
He could not have left a
better commander at Lourdes. Arnaud
was one of those men who
would rather face death a thousand
times than be untrue to their word.
He held the castle long after all the
rest of Bigorre had been wrested
from the English, and the exploits
of the brave knights that took refuge
here made it the terror of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[686]</a></span>
surrounding country. Froissart’s
account of their adventures is
more like that of highwaymen than
of chivalrous knights. They were
continually coming down from their
eyry at the head of a band, to
scour the country and plunder all
they could lay their hands upon.
Sometimes they extended their ravages
to Toulouse, Alby, and Carcassone,
taking castles, robbing
merchants and attacking knights,
and then rushing back to Lourdes
with their booty&mdash;cattle, provisions,
prisoners they could ransom, etc.
They only respected the rights of
Gaston Phœbus, their captain’s
kinsman.</p>

<p>It is related of Mongat that on
one occasion he put on the habit
of a monk, and with three of his
men similarly attired, he took his
way with devout air and mien to
Montpellier, where he alighted at
the Angel and gave out he was a
lord abbot from Upper Gascony
on his way to Paris on business.
Here he made the acquaintance of
the Sire Berenger, who was likewise
going to Paris on some affair
of importance, and was delighted
to be thrown into such holy company.
The pretended abbot led
him by devious ways to Lourdes,
where he ransomed him for a large
sum.</p>

<p>In one of his adventures, Mongat
came to his end. He had been to
Toulouse with two other knights
and one hundred and twenty lances,
and on their way back with cattle,
hogs, sheep, and prisoners, they
were attacked by two hundred
knights, with the brave Ernauton
Bissette at their head, in a forest
belonging to the Sire de Barbazan.
The fury with which they fought
was only equalled by their knightly
courtesy. When exhausted, they
took off their helmets, refreshed
themselves at a stream, and then
resumed the contest. Mongat and
Ernauton fought hand to hand the
whole day, and at length, utterly
exhausted, they both fell dead on
the field. Hostilities then ceased.
Each party bore away its dead, and
a cross was raised on the spot
where they fell.</p>

<p>Of course the whole country
around was eager to dislodge the
English from their fortress. The
Duke of Anjou, with the celebrated
Du Guesclin, attacked it at the
head of fifteen thousand of the best
soldiers of France. All the other
castles of Bigorre had been taken.
Tarbes had been readily given up
by the captain who had sworn to
defend it. Mauvezin had gallantly
held out for a time, and then honorably
surrendered. Lourdes alone
bade defiance to the enemy. The
town, built on a slope at the east
of the castle, resisted the duke’s
army a fortnight. The inhabitants
finally took refuge in the castle, and
the French took possession of the
empty houses, with great rejoicing.
For six weeks they laid siege to the
castle, but in vain. The duke now
sought to obtain it by bribing Arnaud
with vast sums of money, but
the incorruptible captain replied:</p>

<p>“The fortress is not mine. It is
the property of the King of England,
and I cannot sell, alienate, or
give it up, without proving myself
a traitor, which I will not. I will
remain loyal to my liege lord on
whose hand I swore by my faith,
when he appointed me governor of
this castle, to defend it against all
men, and to yield it to no one whom
he had not authorized to demand
it, and Pierre Arnaud will keep to
his trust till he dies.”</p>

<p>Discouraged and mortified, the
duke raised the siege and set fire
to the four quarters of the town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[687]</a></span>
which was wholly consumed, with
all the titles of the ancient <i lang="fr">fors</i> and
rights. He now determined to obtain
the castle by some other means,
and despatched a messenger to
Gaston Phœbus to convince him it
was for his interest to use his influence
in driving the English from
Lourdes. The count promised to
do so and invited Arnaud to Orthez.
Somewhat suspicious of his
intentions, Arnaud, before leaving
Lourdes, appointed his brother
John commander of the fortress,
making him swear by his faith and
honor as a knight to guard it as
faithfully as he had done himself,
and never to yield it to any one
but him who had entrusted it to
their care.</p>

<p>John solemnly swore as he was
desired, and his brother proceeded
to Orthez, where he was graciously
received by the Count of Foix. It
was not till the third day he was
summoned to give up the castle.
Arnaud at once comprehended the
danger of his situation, but undauntedly
replied: “My lord, I
doubtless owe you duty and regard,
for I am a poor knight of your land
and race, but the castle of Lourdes
I cannot surrender. You have sent
for me and can do with me whatever
you please, but what I hold
from the King of England, I will
surrender to no one but him.”</p>

<p>“Ha, traitor!” cried the count
in a rage, drawing his dagger,
“do you tell me you will not do
it? By my head, you shall pay for
such a speech”; and he stabbed
him to the heart.</p>

<p>Arnaud cried: “Ah! my lord,
you act not as beseemeth gentle
knight. You invited me here and
it is thus you put me to death.”</p>

<p>This base act did no good. John
was as faithful to his trust as his
brother Arnaud. His appointment
was confirmed by the King of England,<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
and the English flag was not
taken down till the year 1425, when
the citadel of Lourdes surrendered
to John of Foix, the companion in
arms of Dunois the brave, and the
illustrious Barbazan, first to be
styled <i lang="fr">Sans peur et sans reproche</i>.
Then the war-cry, “S. George for
Lourdes!” was heard for the last
time in the land, and the red flag
of England taken down for ever.</p>

<p>Lourdes was attacked by the
Huguenots in 1573. The town
was taken by assault, pillaged, and
partly burned, but they made no
impression on the castle. A cry
of alarm, however, resounded all
through the Seven Valleys. The
mountaineers of Lavedan knew the
importance of the castle, which,
once taken, would expose them to
an invasion it would be impossible
to resist, and they seized their arms
and gathered under the banners of
the lords of Vieuzac and Arras to
defend the entrance to their valleys.
The Huguenots, astonished at their
determined resistance, were obliged
to retreat to Béarn.</p>

<p>The union of Bigorre with the
crown of France by Henry IV. was
favorable to the prosperity and
happiness of Lourdes, but fatal to
the military importance of the castle.
After being for ages the chief
defence of the land, it now became
the most unimportant fortress in
the country.</p>

<p>In the XVIIIth century it was
made the Bastile of the Pyrenees&mdash;a
prison “created by despotism on
the frontiers of liberty”&mdash;and was
called the Royal Prison of Lourdes.
Here, as the Comte de Marcellus
says:</p>

<p>Père Lacombe, the spiritual director,
or rather disciple, of the
famous Mme. Guyon, was confined
in the castle of Lourdes in 1687.
The see of Tarbes was vacant at
the time, but when a bishop was
appointed, in 1695, he obtained the
deliverance of the poor prisoner,
who did not, however, enjoy his liberty
long. His mind became so
affected that he was again confined
at Charenton, where he died.</p>

<p>In the time of Napoleon I., Lord
Elgin, the famous spoliator of the
Parthenon, on his way back from
Constantinople, came for the recovery
of his health to the springs of
Barrèges, where he was arrested by
the government and brought to the
castle of Lourdes. He characteristically
profited by his confinement
here to strip the fortress of all the
antiquities he could secure, and
carry them off to his residence in
Fifeshire.</p>

<p>The castle ceased to be a prison
at the restoration of the monarchy.
It is now a military post, and accessible
to the tourist, who enters a
postern gate at the east, and ascends
the cliff by a winding stone
staircase, at the top of which he
comes out on a court with a clump
of trees and a few flowers, guarded
by a sentinel ferocious-looking
enough to strike terror into the
heart of the fearless Barbazan himself,
but whom we found to be the
mildest of warriors, and the most accommodating
of guides around the
old <i lang="fr">château-fort</i>. Unless you looked
at him, you would never have
supposed him brought up on the
marrow of lions!</p>

<p>From the battlements there is a
magnificent view of the valley of
the Gave. Never was fairer picture
framed among majestic mountains.
The river flows directly beneath,
through a meadow of wonderful
freshness. On the right bank stands
the spacious monasteries of Mt.
Carmel and S. Benedict, not yet
completed, and the other side, directly
in front of the castle, rises
the new fortress of Our Lady of
Lourdes&mdash;stronghold of the faith&mdash;where
the whole world comes, like
the ancient Barons of Bigorre, to
pay tribute to Mary. It is high
time to turn our steps thither.</p>

<p>Leaving the town of Lourdes by
a narrow street to the west, we
come out into the open valley in
full view of the Gave&mdash;a clear, broad
stream, fed by mountain torrents,
which rushes impetuously over a
rocky bed towards the Adour and
the ocean. It comes from the
south, but here turns abruptly away
from the cliff&mdash;that rises straight
up from its banks to the height of
three hundred feet, crowned with
its old historic castle&mdash;and flows to
the west. In this sharp bend of
the river is the cliff of Massabielle,
from the side of which rises before
us into the clear blue heavens a tall
spire with a golden cross. It is the
celebrated church of Notre Dame
de Lourdes, a pure white edifice
worthy of the spotless Virgin whose
immaculate purity it commemorates&mdash;the
object of so many vows, the
spot to which so many hearts are
turned, and so many feet are wending,
from every part of the Christian
world.</p>

<p>The road between the town and
church is bordered by small booths
for the sale of rosaries, medals, and
every conceivable object of devotion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[689]</a></span>
including pilgrims’ staves and
scallop shells, and stacks of tall
candles to burn before Our Lady
of Lourdes. There are over two
hundred of these little shops, altogether
too many for the place,
though there is a pretty brisk trade
during the season of pilgrimages.
At every step you are called upon
to buy, just as at Loretto, the owner
advertising his wares with the volubility
and something of the style
of the London apprentices in the
time of Lord Nigel. Crossing the
bridge, we stop to look down into
the clear, green, turbulent waters of
the Gave. The mountaineers say
reproachfully to their troublesome
wives: “Maridat lou Gabé, que
staré”&mdash;Marry the Gave, and it will
remain quiet. However refractory
this virgin stream may be, the valley
is peaceful enough to bring the
heart and soul into harmony with
the place we are approaching. All
along the wayside are the blind
and the lame in every stage of horrible
infirmity, appealing to the
charity of the passers-by in the
name of the <i lang="fr">Sainte Vierge</i> of
Lourdes, which no one can resist
in the very sight of her altar, and
we stop every now and then to
buy, in this way, “a pennyworth
of paradise,” like the prudent M.
Géborand, of <em>miser</em>able memory.
We pick our way along through
the crowds of pilgrims, going and
coming with arms full of tapers and
great wooden rosaries, and a bleeding
heart upon their breasts, like a
decoration. We are thrust aside
by a procession hurrying off to the
station, joyously singing some song
of praise, and we turn for a moment
into a soft green meadow on
the banks of the river, with pleasant
winding paths among umbrageous
trees, leading to an immense
ring with rustic roof and open
sides, provided with seats and tables
of beautiful Pyrenean marble&mdash;where
pilgrims can rest and take
their lunch&mdash;the gift of M. Henri
Lasserre, the author of “Our Lady
of Lourdes,” so admirably translated
for <span class="smcap">The Catholic World</span>. At
one end of the meadow is a pretty
<i lang="fr">châlet</i> given the Bishop of Tarbes by
some pious individual for his residence
when he comes to Lourdes.
Turning into the road again, we
come to a fork&mdash;one path leading
up over the cliff to the church, and
the other along the shore of the
river beneath. Taking the latter,
we find a chain stretched across
the way, beyond which no vender
of holy wares can go, or carriage
pass. We keep on beneath the
cliff of Massabielle, crowned with
its fair white church far above our
heads. The few rods that separate
it from the Gave is crowded with
people. We hurry on. A slight
turn brings us suddenly before the
Grotto of the Apparition, towards,
which every eye is turned.…</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse indent6">“O Light Divine!</div>
<div class="verse">Thy Presence and thy power were here.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No words can express the emotions
of the heart at the very sight
of this place of benediction. You
at once feel it has some mysterious
connection with the unseen world.
A thousand memories of its history,
its eighteen apparitions, its
countless miracles, come over you.
You forget the crowd around you.
Like the rest, you kneel on the pavement
to adore and pray.…</p>

<p>The grotto has wisely been left
to nature. It stands open, facing
the Gave, tapestried with ivy, and
rosebushes, and pretty ferns that
grow in the clefts of the rocks.
The birds that build their nests
among the vines undisturbed are
flying to and fro, their songs filling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[690]</a></span>
the air above the hushed crowd.
On one side of the grotto in a
small niche&mdash;the very place where
Bernadette beheld the Marvellous
Vision&mdash;is a statue of the Virgin of
pure white Carrara marble, standing
with folded hands, palm to
palm, and uplifted eyes. A blue
girdle is tied around the waist, a
crystal rosary hangs from her arm,
and <span class="smcap">Je suis l’Immaculée Conception</span>,
in silver letters, form a glory
around her head.</p>

<p>The grotto is all aflame with an
immense pyramidal stand of tapers.
Enormous wax candles, several
inches in circumference, burn
on the pavement among pots of
lilies. The sides of the cave are
hung with innumerable crutches,
canes, shoes, models of hands and
arms, etc., etc., in pious commemoration
of the wonderful cures
wrought here. The pavement is
strewn with bouquets of beautiful
flowers and more practical offerings
in the form of money, voluntarily
thrown in to aid in the construction
of the church. Letters
peep out of the clefts of the rocks,
each with its tale of suffering, its
prayer for aid.</p>

<p>Of course every pilgrim wishes
to enter the grotto, examine it,
touch it with his hands, and kiss it
with profound respect. He wishes
to pluck a branch from the vine
around the niche of the Virgin,
and even appropriate a fragment
of the walls. The necessity will
at once be seen of placing some
bounds to the manifestations of a
piety praiseworthy in its nature,
but serious in its results. To protect
the grotto, therefore, a solid
iron grating bars the entrance, but
allows a clear view of the interior.
It is unlocked from time to time to
admit a knot of pilgrims, so all can
have an opportunity of praying in
so sacred a place. Before the grating
kneel countless pilgrims in the
open air, on the cold pavement
which extends to the very edge of
the Gave, thrust back from its
course to give additional space.
There are a few benches for the
weary and infirm. The different
classes of people gathered here,
the variety of costumes worn by
peasants from different provinces,
and the clergy and sisters of various
orders, to say nothing of the
fashionable dresses of the upper
classes, are a study for the artist
who has set up an easel before the
stone bench along the banks of the
river. Beyond is a long avenue of
trees furnished with seats where
pilgrims are gathered in knots
around huge lunch-baskets. At
the left of the grotto are several
faucets over a long stone basin, fed
by water from the miraculous fountain.
Over them is the inscription:
“<i lang="fr">Allez boire à la fontaine et
vous laver.</i>” Around are crowded
people drinking the healing waters,
or filling their cans and bottles to
carry away. Close by is a room
furnished with cans of all dimensions
for the accommodation of the
pilgrim. Beyond are the bathing
rooms, to so many a pool of Siloam
where the angel is never weary
of troubling the waters. Around
these doors of hope is always a sad
array of the blind, the deaf, the
lame, and the paralytic.</p>

<p>No wonder miracles are wrought
here. There is such simple, unbounded
faith in the divine mercy
and power, that mountains might
be moved. What would be marvellous
elsewhere, only seems the
natural order of things here. Dr.
Dozous, a physician of the place&mdash;who
often accompanied Bernadette
in her visits to the grotto, and has
watched with interest the gradual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[691]</a></span>
development of the devotion to
Notre Dame de Lourdes; and witnessed
a great number of miracles
of all kinds, including the cure of
those who had been blind, or deaf
and dumb, from their birth&mdash;says,
in a book he has recently published:</p>

<p>“The cures of which I have so
often been the ocular witness, and
which I am about to relate, have
convinced me, beyond the possibility
of doubt, of the importance of
Bernadette’s visits to the grotto of
Massabielle, and the reality of the
visions she was there favored with.”</p>

<p>M. Artus, an Alsace refugee at
Bordeaux, whose niece had been
miraculously cured of a serious
malady by recourse to Notre Dame
de Lourdes, has offered ten thousand
francs to any one who will
prove the falseness of any of the
statements in M. Lasserre’s book,
but, though two years have since
passed, no one has been found
quite ready to take up the offer.</p>

<p>Miracles are so constantly wrought
here, that not half of them are recorded.
Five occurred the day
before our arrival, one, a deaf-mute
to whom the faculty of speech was
instantaneously given. We dared
not hope to witness anything of
the kind, nor did we need it to increase
our faith in the power of
Omnipotence, though human nature
is always seeking some sign.
But the piety of the multitude
around obtained the grace we
should not have ventured to ask
for ourselves. We were praying
one morning in the grotto, when
suddenly there was an unusual
movement in the crowd without,
and an increasing wave-like murmur
that broke at last into a tumultuous
shout. A gentleman beside
us seemed to catch the meaning,
for he sprang up and exclaimed
at the top of his voice, <i lang="fr">Vive
Marie!</i> which was answered by
hundreds of voices. The effect
was electrical, and the feeling that
came over us was something new in
our experience. Tears sprang to
the eye. We hurried out of the
grotto, and the movement of the
crowd brought us close to a young
girl raised above the excited multitude,
pale, smiling with joy, and
waving a hand covered with the
marks of ineffectual human remedies,
and that had been utterly
paralyzed an hour before. Every
one crowded around her to see, examine,
test the use of her arm, and
assure themselves of the truth of
the case. She had been fourteen
months in a hospital at Marseilles,
and had come with a large number
of pilgrims from that place who
were ready to testify to her previous
helplessness. The whole
scene was thrilling. Bands of pilgrims
with blue badges of the Virgin
sang hymns of joy. A wave
of excitement every now and then
passed over the crowd and found
vent in repeated <i lang="fr">vivas</i>. The girl
was finally released from the examination
and admitted into the
grotto, when the Magnificat was
intoned.</p>

<p>The cliff of Massabielle has been
cut down and levelled off to serve
as the foundation of the church,
which stands on the top at a distance
of seventy or eighty feet directly
above the grotto. The title of
minor basilica was conferred on it
by His Holiness Pius IX., in
March, 1874. A path leads up to
it from the shore, its windings along
the edge of the cliff forming the
monogram of Mary, among hedges
of roses and arbor-vitæ, glistening
with dew, and overhung with acacias
and evergreens&mdash;a charming
ascent, each step of which leads to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[692]</a></span>
a rarer atmosphere, a lovelier and
more extended view, and nearer
the altar of Mary.</p>

<p>There are two churches, one
above the other; the lower one,
dim and solemn with penitential
gloom; the upper, radiant with the
light and purity that ought to surround</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">“Our tainted nature’s solitary boast.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Let us first enter the crypt. In
the vestibule is a statue of S. Germaine
of Pibrac with her crook
and legendary apron of roses, and
a lamb at her feet&mdash;the gift of a
band of pilgrims from Toulouse.
An arched passage leads each side
of the crypt with banners hung over
the confessionals in the recesses.
Passing through one of these, we
found ourselves in a low, gloomy
nave crowded with columns to support
the upper church. It is chiefly
lighted by the numerous lamps hanging
on every side, and the large
stands of candles that burn before
the Virgin, who is over the altar
embowered among roses. The pavement
is covered with kneeling forms&mdash;ladies,
soldiers, peasants. You
hear the whispered prayer, you
catch glimpses of devout faces,
quivering lips, and upturned eyes.
Everything here is solemn and mysterious,
and inclines one to serious
reflection. On the pillars hang the
different scenes of the great Passion
in which we all had so sad a part.
They strike new terror into the
soul in this sepulchral church that
seems hewn out of the living rock.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent12">“Low I sit,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There are five chapels&mdash;a mystic
number associated with five sorrowful
mysteries&mdash;each with two
small windows pierced through the
thick walls, looking like the loop-holes
of a fort. Their sides are
covered with votive pictures and
small marble tablets with inscriptions,
some of which we copy:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Reconnaissance éternelle à la toute puissante
Notre Dame de Lourdes pour la grace qu’elle m’a
obtenue.</p>

<p class="right">Paris, 30 Juillet, 1872.</p>

<p class="right">“M. M.”</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Amour et reconnaissance à Notre Dame de
Lourdes. Deux cœurs guéris et consolés.”</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A Notre Dame de Lourdes, Colonel L. S.</p>

<p class="right">“6 Aout, 1870.”</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Reconnaissance éternelle à Notre Dame de
Lourdes qui a guèri notre fille.”</p>

</div>

<p>There is a countless number of
similar inscriptions, which are so
many leaves torn from domestic
histories, extremely touching and
suggestive to read. They are eternal
expressions of gratitude, which
are doubtless pleasing to the Divine
Benefactor, who is not regardless
of one who returns to give
thanks.</p>

<p>Our last visit to the crypt will
never be forgotten. We had arrived
at Lourdes the evening before,
in a pouring rain, which still
continued when we went at half-past
four in the morning to attend
the Mass of a clerical friend. It
was with difficulty we made our
way into the nave, crammed with
pilgrims from Bretagne and La Vendée.
The five chapels were filled
with priests waiting for their turn
to say Mass. Our friend had been
there since two o’clock, and it was
nearly seven before he found a vacancy
at the altar. Masses likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[693]</a></span>
had been continually succeeding
each other since midnight in
the fifteen chapels of the church
above. The place, it will be seen,
is one of perpetual prayer.</p>

<p>Our devotions over at a late
hour, we ascended a flight of
twenty-six steps, which brought us
to a broad terrace before the upper
church commanding a lovely view
of the valley, with the picturesque
old castle directly in front. The
sun had come out after the rain,
and nothing could be more fresh
and enchanting. On the terrace
stood the four bells given by the
Prince of Viana, and not yet hung.
They were baptized August 11, by
Cardinal Donnet of Bordeaux, in
presence of a numerous crowd, including
Don Sebastian de Bourbon,
Infante of Spain, the Duc de Nemours,
and the Prince of Béarn and
Viana.</p>

<p>Before entering the church, we
pause in front of the Gothic portal
to look up at the representation of
our Saviour over the central arch.
His face is turned towards Lourdes,
a cruciform nimbus surrounds his
head, the Alpha and Omega are at
the side, and his right hand is raised
to bless the pilgrim beneath.
At each side are the winged emblems
of the Evangelists. And
lower down is the Virgin Mother,
her hands crossed on her breast,
her face,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The most resembling Christ,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">sweet and thoughtful. She seems
to be awaiting all who seek through
her the Divine Redeemer, who by
her has been given to mankind.
<i lang="la">Felix cœli porta</i>, we say as we pass
beneath.</p>

<p>Entering the church, we are at
once struck with its immaculate
purity. It is in the style of the
XIIIth century. The height is
about double the width, which
makes the arches seem loftier than
they really are. The spotless white
walls are relieved by the beautiful
banners hanging on every side.
There are about four hundred of
these banners, richly embroidered
with religious symbols and devices,
and the arms of different cities
and provinces. Conspicuous among
them are the banners of Alsace
and Lorraine bordered with crape.
They were wrought in secret, and
brought over the frontier in the
night to escape the vigilance of the
Prussian police. They were presented
by faithful Christians, one
of whom was a valiant officer whose
breast was covered with decorations,
and received by the Archbishop of
Auch (to whose province Lourdes
belongs), who wept as he pressed
them to his lips, affecting the vast
crowd to tears.</p>

<p>Around the nave of the church
is an unique frieze of votive golden
hearts, so arranged as to form inscriptions
in immense letters, taken
from the words of the Virgin to
Bernadette: “<span class="smcap">Vous prierez pour
la conversion des pécheurs.
Allez boire à la fontaine et
vous y laver.&mdash;Allez dire aux
prêtres qu’il doit se bâtir ici
une chapelle, et qu’on doit y
venir en procession.</span>”</p>

<p>The main altar in the centre of
the choir is dedicated to the mystery
of the Immaculate Conception.
It is of pure white marble, and on
the front are five compartments on
which are sculptured the Annunciation,
Visitation, Assumption, Coronation,
and the Apparition of
the Blessed Virgin in the grotto.
The altar is adorned with white
lilies. Over it in a golden niche is a
statue of Mary Most Pure, “above
all women glorified,” the very embodiment
of purity and love. Above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">[694]</a></span>
her, like a crown, is a constellation
of beautiful lamps of filigree and
enamel. Rich votive offerings are
fastened to the walls&mdash;crosses of
the Legion of Honor, epaulettes,
swords crossed above flags, a miniature
ship, the mitre of Mgr. Lawrence,
etc. On the keystone of
the arch are sculptured the arms
of Pope Pius IX.</p>

<p>The main altar with its Madonna
is the central object in the church,
and the focus of its splendor.
Around it, like so many rays around
the Immaculate Conception, are
five apsidal chapels. Directly behind
it is the chapel of the Sacred
Heart, where of course the Blessed
Sacrament is kept. At the left is
Notre Dame du Mont Carmel, in
honor of the last apparition to Bernadette,
which took place on the
festival of that name. Next is the
chapel of Notre Dame des Victoires,
in commemoration of the celebrated
archconfraternity at Paris, which
has effected so many conversions,
wrought so many miracles, and prepared
the way, as it were, for the
triumph of the Immaculate Conception.</p>

<p>At the right of the chapel of the
Sacred Heart is that of Notre Dame
du Rosaire, recalling the rosary the
Virgin held on her arm in all her
apparitions to Bernadette. Then,
Notre Dame de la Sallette, reminding
us that the tears the Mother of
Sorrows once shed over the woes
of France in the mountains of Dauphine,
have been succeeded by the
smiles of Marie Immaculée in the
grotto of the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>Each of these five chapels recall
the Holy Trinity by the number
of their windows, as the rose window
in the façade is typical of the
Divine Unity. These windows are
of stained glass&mdash;the gift of the
Prince of Viana. The main altar
and the statue of the Immaculate
Conception are from an anonymous
benefactor, and many of the other
altars are the gifts of private individuals.</p>

<p>Ten lateral chapels open out of
the nave, and communicate with
each other for convenience. The
four nearest the choir bring around
Mary the principal members of her
family: S. Anne, S. Joachim, S.
Joseph, and S. John the Baptist.
Then come the chapel of S. Peter,
still living in our “Pope of the Immaculate
Conception,” who so glorified
Mary on the 8th of December,
1854; S. John, the beloved
disciple, who was appointed her
son on Mt. Calvary; S. Francis of
Assisi, the patriarch of the Seraphic
Order that has always been the advocate
of the Immaculate Conception;
S. Francis Xavier, patron of
the Society for the Propagation of
the Faith, one of the glories of this
age of Mary; S. Bertrand, the illustrious
bishop of Commines and
the patron saint of Mgr. Lawrence,
whose name will ever be associated
with the church of Notre Dame de
Lourdes; and S. Germaine, the
humble shepherdess of Pibrac, so
like the little <i lang="fr">bergère</i> of Lourdes.</p>

<p>Thus four of the great religious
orders of the church are represented
before the Virgin’s throne&mdash;the
Carmelite, Dominican, Franciscan,
and Jesuit. Each chapel, sacred
to some holy mystery, has its beautiful
altar, its carved oaken confessional,
its circular golden chandelier,
its station of the cross, its
banners, and its statues.</p>

<p>The carved oak pulpit on the
left side of the nave was given by
the Bishop of Marseilles.</p>

<p>The windows of the side chapels,
that await a donor, will depict the
history of Notre Dame de Lourdes,
beginning with the first apparition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[695]</a></span>
and ending with the consecration
of the church. And the clerestory
windows will represent the history
of the devotion to the Immaculate
Conception. The decoration of
the church is by no means complete.
It is to be in harmony with
the architecture, so pure in outline
and light in form. In the seventy-six
arcatures of the triforium the
saints most devoted to the Immaculate
Conception are to be represented
on a gilt ground.</p>

<p>To see this beautiful church
crowded with devout pilgrims,
priests at every altar of the fifteen
chapels, a grand service going on
in the choir with all the solemn
pomp displayed in great cathedrals,
the numerous clergy in the
richest vestments, and to hear the
grand music of Palestrina executed
with perfect harmony and
exquisite taste&mdash;the whole congregation
heartily joining in the chants,
and the peal of the trumpets contrasting
admirably with their earnest
voices&mdash;is to the ravished soul
like a vision of the heavenly Jerusalem.
The lofty arches seem to
sway with the undulations of the
music, sometimes soft as the murmur
of a rivulet, and again as deep
as a mountain torrent falling over
rocks. The eye is never weary of
gazing at this fair temple with its
pure outlines, so harmonious in all
its parts, the soft light coming in
floods through the lofty windows
and mingling with the brilliancy of
the lights and flowers; the immense
oriflammes hanging from the
arches to give testimony to the
glory of the Immaculate Conception
and the Pontiff who crowned
that glory; the mysterious words
on the wall that fell from the smiling
lips of the Virgin in the grotto;
and the Most Pure herself, unveiled
to all eyes, standing in the midst
of all this splendor above the altar,
in a golden atmosphere, raising
heavenward her look of inspiration,
her hands joined in prayer,
her heart swelling with love&mdash;adoring
love for Him who dwells in the
tabernacle; and maternal love for
her children gathered around the
fountain opened for the salvation
of the world. O Immaculate One!
we here feel thy sweet presence,
and the creative power of thy
word: “Go, tell the priests I wish
a chapel to be built on this spot.”</p>

<p>Never was greater miracle wrought
by humbler instrumentality&mdash;never
was the Divine Hand more manifest
than in the upspringing of
this mountain chapel&mdash;the lily of
the Immaculate Conception, sweetest
flower of this age of Mary.
Human intelligence is confounded
at what has been effected by the
mouth of a poor peasant girl of
this obscure valley. It grasps at
the assurance of faith in Mary who
has wrought it. Before her the
Gave that beat against the cliff has
fallen back&mdash;image of the torrent
that approached Mary at the moment
of her creation, and, just as
she was about to receive the fatal
stain, the wave of corruption, that
bears all of us poor children of
Eve on its impure waters, fell back
before the ark of the new covenant,
Fœderis Arca.</p>

<p>The very cliffs have bowed down
at her presence, and these stones,
these walls, these columns, these
arches, and the fountain of indisputable
potency that has sprung
out of the bowels of the earth, bear
witness to her wonderful apparitions
and power.</p>

<p>One of the most imposing spectacles
at Lourdes is a procession
of pilgrims, especially when seen, as
we saw one, from the mount above
coming from the town&mdash;a very forest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[696]</a></span>
of crosses, banners, and lanterns,
borne by thousands of people
with that slow, measured, solemn,
harmonious step that is in itself a
prayer. We thought of good Mother
Hallahan and her delight in
nine miles of prayer. Here were
whole leagues of praise.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse indent6">“On the ear</div>

<div class="verse">Mother of Purity and Peace!</div>
<div class="verse indent1">They sing the Saviour’s name and thine:</div>
<div class="verse">Clothe them forever with the fleece</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Unspotted of thy Lamb Divine!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From one end of the immense
procession to the other rose chants
without discord&mdash;here from a band
of maidens and innocent children,
yonder from harmonious choirs of
maturer years. From time to time
a peal of trumpets drowned the
murmur of the Gave and awoke
the echoes of the mountains. In
the procession were hundreds of
men organized into pious confraternities
as in the Middle Ages.
They follow the path taken by
Bernadette, when she was irresistibly
led on to the place of the wondrous
vision. They all stop to make a
genuflection where she knelt before
the Beautiful Lady, and begin the
Litany of Loretto in the sweet
plaintive air peculiar to the country.
It is delightful to hear Mary’s
name swelling along the valley and
up the rocky heights! Thus chanting
they ascend the winding path
on the cliff, forming a living monogram
of the Virgin’s name, among
roses that give out their perfume,
through cedars of Lebanon and
other rare trees that bend down
their branches laden with dew.
And above this verdure, these perfumes,
and these chanted supplications,
the white marble Church of
the Immaculate Conception sends
heavenward the silent prayer of its
gleaming walls, its pillars, its turrets
and pinnacles. They wind around
the church like a wreath and disappear
within its sculptured portal
chanting: <i lang="la">Lætatus sum in his quæ
dicta sunt mihi</i>&mdash;I was glad at the
things that were said to me. We
will go into the house of the
Lord.… Our feet were wont to
stand in thy courts, O Jerusalem!
Jerusalem which is built as a city
that is at unity with itself.…
Plenteousness be to them that love
thee!</p>

<p>At the particular request of the
Prince of Viana, one of the greatest
benefactors to the church, his Holiness
Pope Pius IX. has granted a
partial indulgence to all who visit
the church, and a plenary indulgence
to those who here approach
the sacraments and pray for concord
among Christian princes the
extirpation of heresies, and the exaltation
of our holy Mother the
Church.</p>

<p>A winding road leads from the
church by gentle ascent up the picturesque
mount behind, along which
are to be built fifteen chapels in
honor of the Mysteries of the Rosary,
where the words once spoken
by the angel will ascend the mountain
side in one long and incessant
Ave Maria! Along this holy way
will continually ascend and descend
the pious votary in “pilgrim’s cowl
and lowly weed”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Dropping on each mystic bead</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A certain party, desirous of
bringing pilgrimages into disrepute,
and inclined to seek some human
cause for everything supernatural,
attributes a political object to this
great crusade of prayer which the
impious instinctively tremble before,
and not without reason. M.
Lasserre thus closes an address to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[697]</a></span>
the visitor to Notre Dame de
Lourdes:</p>

<p>“Pilgrims of France! Your politics
at the grotto of Lourdes is to
pray, to begin a new life, to sanctify
yourselves, and to become in this
corrupt age the chosen righteous
who are to save the wicked cities
of the land. It is thus you will
labor efficaciously for the prosperity
of your country and bring
back its past splendor and glory.
A nation desirous of salvation in
heaven, is a nation saved on earth.”</p>

<p>We close by echoing one of the
acclamations sung alternately by
clergy and people at the solemn
celebration in this place of benediction:</p>

<p>V. Omnibus nobis peregrinantibus,
et universo Christiano populo,

<h3>THE HOUSE OF JOAN OF ARC.</h3>

<p>I am writing these lines in a
small inn of Domrémy, on the evening
of my pilgrimage to the lowly
dwelling of Jeanne d’Arc. My table
is an old coffer, shakily placed
on the rugged and disjointed paving
stones which form the floor,
and my only companion a kitten
gambolling in the red rays of the
setting sun. I thus begin my account
of that house which has been
well called the <i lang="la">santa casa</i> of France.</p>

<p>Arriving at Domrémy while yet
its green valleys were enveloped in
the white vapors rising from the
Meuse, my first sight of the place
was through the mist of early morning.</p>

<p>It is a small village of Lorraine,
near the confines of Champagne.
God, who so often wills to choose a
mere nothing through which to exercise
his power, chose it as the
starting-point of his work for the
deliverance of France. For Domrémy
was a little village also in the
year 1425, when there the heavenly
light appeared, there the angel descended,
and the voices not of
earth were heard.</p>

<p>The mutilation of this province
by the German invasion has only
rendered Domrémy more <i lang="fr">lorrain</i>
than ever: and the Vosges Mountains
raise their blue summits
along the horizon and lengthen
their shadows as if the better to
guard the home of her who was the
good angel of her country.</p>

<p>The village consists of scarcely
more than a hundred houses, clustered
round the venerable church
and the old walls of the cottage
which sheltered the infancy and
youth of the daughter of Jaques
d’Arc and his wife Isabelle Romée.</p>

<p>This church, to which her earliest
steps were bent, the place of her
prayers and inspirations, where she
armed her soul with virtue and
heroism before arming her breast
like a brave warrior preparing for
battle&mdash;this church is more than
lowly, it is poor; and it is matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[698]</a></span>
for wonder that, if no one else does
so, at least that the maidens of
France do not organize themselves
into an association which should
make it their chosen sanctuary, and
by which they would engage themselves
not only to provide it with
what is necessary and fitting, but
with pious generosity to enrich and
beautify their privileged altar.</p>

<p>At the threshold of the church
stands a ridiculous statue of Jeanne
d’Arc. It seems a sort of sacrilege
so to have misrepresented the features
of the Maid; and the best way
to dispose of this image would be
to throw it into a furnace and melt
it down in company with the still
more objectionable equestrian statue
recently erected in the Place des
Pyramides at Paris, which insults
the modest virgin by placing her
astride on her charger, in a complete
suit of armor, instead of the
steel breastplate which alone she
wore over her womanly apparel.
Then, out of the metal of these
molten caricatures might be struck
medals of worthier design, to be
distributed in the country.</p>

<p>Among the trees at a few paces
from the church is a little Greek
monument supported by four columns,
beneath which is a bust of
Jeanne in white marble. Facing
this little monument, about a stone’s
throw off, stands her dwelling.
This house is separated from the
road by two pavilions connected
by a railing of gilt arrows. Trees
envelop its walls with their overshadowing
branches, and a third
part of the roof is covered with ivy.
Above the door, which is low, are
three shields of armorial bearings,
the Arms of France, charged with
a sword, and those of the family of
D’Arc; or, to speak more exactly,
the door is surmounted by three
escutcheons, namely, that of Louis
XI., who caused the cottage to be
embellished; that which was granted
to one of the brothers of Jeanne,
together with the name of Lys; and
a third, which bears a star and three
ploughshares, to symbolize Jeanne’s
heavenly mission and the lowly
condition of her parents. Two inscriptions
in uncial Gothic are
graven on the stone: “<i lang="fr">Vive Labeur!</i>”&mdash;the
motto of Jeanne and
the <i lang="fr">resumé</i> of her history; and “<i lang="fr">Vive
le Roi Loys!</i>”&mdash;the <i lang="fr">resumé</i> of her
great work.</p>

<p>On the left of the door is a lattice
window with diamond-shaped panes.
Two rooms constitute the whole of
the house. Jeanne was born in the
first and larger of the two; the
second and inner one is dimly
lighted by a small window opening
towards the church. Here it
was that Jeanne listened to the
heavenly voices, and here she heard
the church bells summoning to
prayer, or sounding the tocsin,
when the village was attacked by
marauding bands who came to sack
the place and cut down the partisans
of the throne of France.</p>

<p>On several occasions fugitives
were concealed by her in this obscure
chamber. She gave up her
bed to them, and went to rest in
the hayloft.</p>

<p>Facing the hearth in the entrance
room is a statue in bronze, reduced
from the expressive figure by the
Princess Mary of Orleans.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Garlands
of moss surround this statue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[699]</a></span>
and rose-leaves are scattered at its
feet. The nuns who are in charge
of the house assemble every evening
in this room with the young
girls of the village, to sing hymns.
On the wall hangs a crucifix, and
beneath it stands an image of the
Blessed Virgin; and here the nuns
with their little flock keep the
month of Mary, celebrating the
praises of the Royal Virgin of
Judah, who was so dear to the
heart of the virgin of Domrémy.</p>

<p>Here and there upon the walls
are <i lang="la">ex votos</i>, slabs of marble and
bronze relating facts worthy of remembrance
in honor of Jeanne, or
recalling historic dates. The beams
and rafters of the ceiling are dinted
by axe and sabre strokes given
by the Prussians in 1814, not by
any means from disrespect, or motives
of jealousy, but merely from
an outbreak of destructive devotion.
They entered the house, silent, and
with their hats off, but they did not
wish to leave it without taking from
it some relics to carry into their
own country.</p>

<p>Numerous pilgrims have been
guilty of the low and objectionable
proceeding of carving their names
on the stones of the house, although
a register is kept at hand on purpose
to receive the visitors’ names
and impressions. The piece of furniture
on which the volumes are
placed was presented last year by
a prince of France, and accompanied
by the gift of a piece of Gobelin
tapestry representing the entry
of King Charles VII. and <i lang="fr">Jehanne
la bonne Lorraine</i> into the city of
Rheims.</p>

<p>The latest volume of the register
commences in 1871, after the disasters
and misfortunes of France.
To every name inscribed in its
pages, whether of aristocrat or commoner,
officers of the army or men
of the rank and file, thoughts are
elaborated of more or less pretension
to literary merit, in prose or
verse, but the dominant idea is prayer
to God for the salvation of
France, and grateful love to Jeanne
d’Arc; while here and there are
appeals to the Sovereign Pontiff for
the beatification of the young patriot
martyr, or at any rate for a
solemn affirmation of the miraculous
nature of her call and the sanctity
of her life.</p>

<p>A touching incident occurred not
quite a year ago. One evening in
the month of May, two English ladies,
nuns of the Order of Servites,
visited the house, accompanied by
a priest of Vaucouleurs, and had no
sooner crossed the threshold than,
falling on their knees, they burst
into tears, entreating God to pardon
England, guilty of the death
of Joan of Arc, and making a fervent
act of reparation for their
country, their ancestors, and themselves.
Nor did they rise before
they had kissed the floor of that
lowly cottage where she had so often
knelt in prayer to God and in
converse with his glorified saints,
and where she had lived in the fulfilment
of the daily duties of her
lowly estate.</p>

<p>On another occasion a band of
volunteers, on their way to join the
army, came to ask <i lang="fr">La Pucelle</i> to
help them to be good soldiers, and
begging her blessing on themselves
and their arms as they would that
of a canonized saint. A cavalry officer
made a visit to Domrémy expressly
to remind her that one of
his comrades in arms died at Gravelotte
repeating her name. A great
number of officers who made their
escape from Germany also came
hither direct from the frontier, to
return thanks for their safety, before
returning to the homes where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[700]</a></span>
their families were anxiously awaiting
them.</p>

<p>A great pope has said, “France
will not perish, for God has always
a miracle in reserve to save her.”</p>

<p>The miracle came in the middle
of the XVth century, in the person
of Jeanne d’Arc. It may come
again through her instrumentality;
not this time leading on the victors
at Orleans, Patay, Troyes, Rheims,
Compeigne, Paris, or dying at Rouen
amid the flames, but crowned a
saint upon the Church’s altars, as a
powerful intercessor for her native
land. Mgr. Dupanloup has given
a great impetus to the desire for
forwarding her cause at the infallible
tribunal of the Catholic
Church.</p>

<p>Gerson, the great and pious
chancellor, and the contemporary
of Joan of Arc, ardently desired
the same cause, which is now taken
to heart, not only by the illustrious
bishop, but also by the clergy, the
magistrature, and the army in Orleans,
who are at the head of various
commissions employed in obtaining
the evidence necessary for
aiding the judgment of the Sovereign
Pontiff. He will have a pleasant
task who may be entrusted to
collect the popular traditions which
linger like a fragrance at Domrémy,
of the innocent and holy life
of Joan of Arc, and to him the
very walls of her cottage birthplace
will be eloquent: <i lang="la">lapides clamabunt</i>.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<h3>DOMINIQUE DE GOURGUES,<br />
<i>THE AVENGER OF THE HUGUENOTS IN FLORIDA, A CATHOLIC</i>.</h3>

<p>The traveller between Bordeaux
and Bayonne who takes an eastward
train at Morcenx, will arrive
in less than an hour at Mont-de-Marsan,
a small town of four or
five thousand inhabitants, on the
borders of the Landes, at the confluence
of the Douze and Midou,
which form the Midouze. Some
say it was founded on the site of
an old temple of Mars, by Charlemagne,
on his return from Roncesvalles.
If so, the place was afterwards
destroyed by the Saracen or
Norman invaders, for the fifth Vicomte
de Marsan, desirous of purging
the forest of Maremsin of the
robbers who endangered the lives
and property of the merchants and
pilgrims who passed that way, built
a castle at the junction of the two
rivers, on a spot which bore a name
of ominous meaning: <i lang="fr">Maü-pas</i>, or
<i lang="fr">Mauvais-pas</i>&mdash;doubtless a bad place
to fall into, on account of the frequent
robberies. Around this castle
gathered the vassals of the neighboring
abbey of S. Sever for protection.
They came from the
parish of S. Pierre-du-Mont, and
brought their devotion to S. Peter
with them. The arms of the town
are still two keys <i lang="fr">en pal</i>, between
the letters M. M. (Mons Martianus);
and the parish church that
stood till the Revolution, was dedicated
to S. Peter, where the
mayor, before entering on his functions,
took the following curious
oath in three languages&mdash;the Gascon,
Latin, and French:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In 1256, the town passed into
the possession of the lords of Béarn,
and to keep it in due subjection
Gaston Phœbus built the castle of
<i lang="fr">Nou-li-bos</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <em>You-do-not-wish-it-there</em>,
referring to the opposition of
the inhabitants&mdash;a name that recalls
the famous <em>Quiquengrogne</em>
erected by Anne of Bretagne to keep
the town of S. Malo in check, and
the <em>Bridle</em> built by Louis XII. at
the entrance of the harbor of Genoa.</p>

<p>Calvinism, of course, took some
root here in the time of Jeanne
d’Albret. Theodore Beza sent
preachers to win over the people,
but the Catholics organized under
the Seigneur de Ravignan and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">[702]</a></span>
a while kept the Huguenots from
any excesses. Montgomery, however,
soon swept over the country,
sacking all the churches and monasteries,
many of which he razed to
the ground. Among these was the
convent of Bayries, a community
of Clarist nuns in the vicinity of
Mont-de-Marsan, founded in 1270
by Gaston Phœbus and his wife
Amate, which numbered Catherine
d’Albret, a cousin of Francis I.,
among its abbesses. Marie d’Albret,
another relative of the king’s,
was abbess when the marriage between
him and Eleanore of Austria
took place here, July 6, 1530. This
house of historic interest was stripped
of every valuable by the Huguenots,
and then burned to the
ground, the nuns barely escaping
with their lives.</p>

<p>The redoubtable Monluc soon
avenged all these sacrileges by taking
Mont-de-Marsan, and despatching
all who opposed the passage of
his troops. The few Huguenot soldiers
left, he threw from the windows

<p>This castle of terrible memory
has a pleasanter association, for in
it passed the early childhood of the
poet François Le Poulchre, the
king’s knight, and lord of La Motte-Messemé,
who boasted of descending
from the ancient Roman consul,
Appius Pulcher, who displayed such
conspicuous valor under the famous
Lucullus,</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He took for his device: <i lang="la">Suum cuique
pulchrum</i>, in allusion to his
name.</p>

<p>As his father was superintendent
of the household of Margaret, queen
of Navarre, sister of Francis I.,
François Le Poulchre had the honor
of having that king for his godfather,
and Margaret for his godmother.
The latter conceived such
an affection for him that she kept
him at her castle at Marsan, and
made him eat at her table as soon
as he was old enough. He says
himself:</p>

arms.</p>

into seven books bearing the

name of the nine muses, and the
poetical Zodiac of Marcellus Palingenesis
bears the names of the
twelve signs of the zodiac. To
compose it, he retired to the Château
de Bouzemont in Lorraine.
We trust he was more skilful in the
use of the sword than of the pen.
One of his sonnets, however, is pleasing.
It is like a single flower in a

<p class="noindent">stopped at Mont-de-Marsan, where
he made Le Poulchre <i lang="fr">escuyer d’escuyrie
ordinaire</i>, as the poet does
not fail to record, and shortly after
he received the collar of knighthood
from the same royal hand.</p>

<p>The château of Gaston Phœbus,
which had received so many princes
and princesses within its walls, and
been the witness of so many tragedies,
was, after being taken anew
from the Huguenots, totally demolished
by the order of Louis XIII
A charming promenade, called the
<em>Pépinière</em>, surrounded by the
Douze, is now the spot.</p>

<p>Mont-de-Marsan was formerly a
centre of considerable trade, and
the entrepôt of the country around.
Wine, grain, turpentine, wool, etc.,
were brought here to be sent down
the Midouze. This was a source
of considerable revenue to the
place, and explains the extensive
warehouses, now unused in consequence
of the railway and the diversion
of trade. There is still a
little wharf, where are moored several
barks laden with wood or turpentine,
but there is not business
enough to disturb the quietness of
the place. No one would suppose
it had ever been the theatre
of terrible events. The most striking
feature is a peculiar oblong
court, surrounded by houses of
uniform style, with numerous balconies
for the spectators to witness
the bull-fights occasionally held
here&mdash;an amusement that accords
with the fiery nature and pastoral
pursuits of the people around, and
is still clung to in several places in
the Landes and among the Pyrenees.
This square is, by a singular
anomaly, called the <em>Place St. Roch</em>,
from a saint regarded throughout
the region as the patron of animals;
and they certainly have need
of his protection in a place where
they are exposed to such cruelty.</p>

<p>Such are some of the characteristics
and memories of the small
inland town in which was born
Dominique de Gourgues, the leader
of the celebrated expedition
against the Spaniards in Florida.
He was the third son of Jean de
Gourgues and Isabella de Lau, his
wife.</p>

<p>He was born in the year 1537, in
an age of religious conflict, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">[704]</a></span>
party spirit ran too high for any
one to remain neutral, whatever
their grade of piety. It might
therefore seem surprising there
should ever have been any doubt
as to the religious convictions of
De Gourgues. Because he was the
avenger of the massacre of the
Huguenots in Florida, he has often
been identified with the Protestant
party. Because he lived in an age
when provincial and sectarian spirit
often prevailed over patriotism,
it has been taken for granted that
sympathy with the religious sentiments
of the victims of the Spaniards
could alone have induced
him to sell his property to provide
for a distant and dangerous expedition
that would never repay him
even if successful. In a work entitled,
<cite>La France Protestante</cite>, by
MM. Haag, a kind of dictionary
of Protestant celebrities in France,
issued in 1853 by a proselyting
press, whose works are everywhere
to be found, De Gourgues is made
a Huguenot. No proof is given,
no doubt expressed&mdash;the surest and
shortest way of carrying one’s point
in these days. Assurance always
produces a certain effect even on the
thoughtfully-minded. They take
it for granted it has some real foundation.</p>

<p>The <cite>Revue Protestante</cite><a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> makes
the same assertion, appealing to De
Thou and other historians.</p>

<p>Francis Parkman, in his <cite>Pioneers
of France in the New World</cite>, says:
“There was a gentleman of Mont-de-Marsan,
Dominique de Gourgues,
a soldier of ancient birth and
high renown. That he was a Huguenot
is not certain. The Spanish
annalist Barcia calls him a terrible
heretic; but the French Jesuit,
Charlevoix, anxious the faithful
should share the glory of his exploits,
affirms, that, like his ancestors
before him, he was a good
Catholic. If so, his faith sat lightly
upon him, and Catholic or heretic,
he hated the Spaniards with a
mortal hate.”</p>

<p>The English made the Catholic
Church responsible for the massacre
of the Huguenots. The account
of Le Moyne, published in
England under the patronage of
Raleigh, inflamed anew the public
mind against Catholicity, and the
terrible words of the Spanish leader,
<i lang="es">El que fuere herege morira</i>,
were regarded as the echo of the
church. Consequently the avengers
of the deed were supposed to
be necessarily Protestants&mdash;not only
De Gourgues, but all his followers.
Nor is this all. The whole family
of the latter is said to have been
converted to Calvinism in the
XVIth century.</p>

<p>M. le Vicomte de Gourgues, the
present representative of the family,
desirous of vindicating the orthodoxy
of his ancestors, and, in particular,
of so illustrious a relative
as Dominique de Gourgues, has
given to the public incontrovertible
proofs that the whole family
was eminently Catholic, that Dominique
lived and died in the faith,
and that his expedition to Florida
was a patriotic deed in which religious
zeal had no part. He felt the
anger of a man of honor against the
cruelty of the Spaniards. A great
national injury was to be avenged,
and he was too good a soldier not
to wish to be foremost in the conflict.
And perhaps some private motives
excited him to vengeance, for he
had been taken himself by the Spaniards,
and narrowly escaped death
at their hands, and could therefore
feel for these new victims of their
barbarity. Moreover, his expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">[705]</a></span>
was the expression of public
sentiment in France concerning the
massacre&mdash;the mere outburst of the
electric current that ran over the
country at such an insult to the
honor of France. The assertion
that De Gourgues was a Protestant
is a modern invention without a
shadow of foundation. None of
the old French historians express
any doubt as to his orthodoxy.
Even the romances in which he
figures represent him as a Catholic,
as if his religion were a prominent
feature in his character. Some
years ago, a novel was published
in the <cite>Siècle</cite> called “La Peine du
Talion,” of which the Chevalier de
Gourgues is the hero, and on his
Catholicity turns the interest of
the story. He is represented as a
brilliant cavalier who has served in
the wars of Italy, and is now an officer
in the service of the Duke of
Guise, whose favor he enjoys. An
attachment is formed between him
and Estiennette de Nérac, whose
hand he requests in marriage. The
Seigneur de Nérac expresses great
surprise that Messire Dominique
should forget the insuperable abyss
there is between an ardent Catholic
in the service of the house
of Lorraine and his Protestant
daughter.</p>

<p>But for more serious proofs.
And first let us examine the orthodoxy
of Dominique de Gourgues’
family.</p>

<p>That his parents were Catholics
is proved by the list of those who appeared
in the ban and arrière-ban
at Mont-de-Marsan, March 4, 1537.
“Noble Jean de Gourgues, Seigneur
de Gaube and Monlezun, present
at the convocation held in this
town by order of the king.” And
Isabella de Lau, his wife, requests
in her will “to be buried in the
church of the convent of the Cordeliers
at Mont-de-Marsan,<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> before
the chapel of the Conception
where the ancestors of the said De
Gourgues are buried.” It is sure,
therefore, that Dominique was baptized
in the Catholic Church at
Mont-de-Marsan.</p>

<p>Dominique and his brother Ogier
left their native place in early life
and established themselves at Bordeaux.
The former was never
married, and seems to have made
his home with his brother, to whom
he was greatly attached. At the
château de Vayries there were, a
few years ago, four old evergreen
trees of some foreign species, at the
corners of the lawn before the terrace,
said by tradition to have been
planted by the hero of Florida.</p>

<p>Ogier became king’s counsellor
in the council of state, and president
of the treasury in Guienne,
and, after serving his country faithfully
under five kings, died full of
years and honors at his house in
Bordeaux, “without leaving the
like of his quality in Guyenne.”
He took part in all the affairs of the
province, in the accounts of which
we find many things significant of
his religious convictions. Monluc
mentions him in his <cite>Commentaries</cite>,
as offering to procure wheat and
cattle from the Landes, on his own
credit, when it was proposed to
fortify the coast to defeat the projects
of the Huguenots. He placed
his property as much as possible at
the disposal of the king. He manifested
great interest in the reduction
of La Rochelle, and lent
twenty-three hundred livres to enable
the Baron de la Gardie to despatch
his galleys to the siege, as
is shown by the following letter
from the king:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">[706]</a></span></p>

<p>“For the payment of my galleys
which I have ordered Baron de la
Gardie, the general, to despatch
promptly to the coast of Bretagne
on a service of great importance,
… I write praying you to advance
to Sieur Felix the sums I have assigned
for this purpose, … trusting
that, as in the past you have
never spared your means and substance
in my service, you will spare
them still less in this urgent necessity.
I have been advised, however,
by the said Sieur de la Gardie
that you have not yet lent your
aid, which I am persuaded proceeds
from want of means; but well knowing
the credit you have in my city
of Bordeaux, and trusting to your
good-will, I send this line to beg
you, in continuation of the good
and acceptable services I have
heretofore received from you in
public affairs, and on other occasions
which have presented themselves,
to do me likewise this other
in so extreme a need, to advance
and place in the hands of the said
Felix the sums I have assigned in
aid, not only of the said Sieur de
la Gardie, but the other captains of
my said galleys, which I will pay
and reimburse you, or those who
by your favor and credit shall have
advanced them.… (Hoping) that
you have lessened in no way the
extreme affection you have had till
the present, in all that relates to my
service, which I will not forget in
due time or fail to recognize, …
to gratify you in every way possible,
… I finish praying God, Sr.
de Gourgues, to have you in his
holy keeping.&mdash;Given at Gaillon
the 24th of May, 1571.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Charles.</span>”</p>

<p>The appeal was not in vain, as
we have said.</p>

<p>Máréchal de Matignon, in a letter
to the king in 1585, renders the
following fine testimony concerning
Ogier de Gourgues:</p>

<p>“Sire, the pestilence in this city
continues to such a degree that
there is not a person, with the
means of living elsewhere, who has
not left it, and there are now only
the Srs. Premier President and De
Gourgues, who remain out of the
special affection they have for your
service.”</p>

<p>Ogier de Gourgues had two sons,
Antoine and Marc Antoine. Antoine,
the elder, presumed by MM.
Haag and others to be a Protestant,
is thus spoken of in the
<cite>Chronique Bourdeloyse</cite>, published in
1672:</p>

<p>“The château de Castillon, in
Médoc, having been surprised by
some troops, has been restored to
the obedience of the king and the
Seigneur de Matignon in eight days
by Capt. de Gourgues, <i lang="fr">mestre de
camp</i> of a French regiment, and
cousin of him who attacked the
Spaniards in Florida.”</p>

<p>And in another place: “And after
some sorties from the garrison of
Blaye, in which Capt. de Gourgues,
while fighting valiantly, was wounded,
and after some days died, the said
Seigneur de Matignon raised the
siege.”</p>

<p>Of course, Marshal de Matignon’s
lieutenant could not be a
Huguenot. Besides, the account
of the expenses at the grand funeral
services of Capt. Antoine de Gourgues,
attended by all the religious
communities in Bordeaux, is still
extant. By this we find seven livres
are paid the Carmelite monks for
their services three days, and the
use of several objects for the funeral;
three crowns to the canons of
St. André for High Mass and the
burial service; twenty sols to the
Brothers of the Observance for
three days’ assistance and the use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">[707]</a></span>
of robes; four crowns to the religious
of the Chapelet for aiding in
the three days’ service; five sols to
the Brothers of Mary for the same;
two crowns to twenty-four priests
who recited prayers around the
bier; fifty-one sols each to four
women who dressed the body and
remained with it day and night;
one sol apiece given to three thousand
poor on the day of burial, and
six deniers the following day, etc.,
etc. There is a <i lang="fr">chapelle ardente</i>,
hung with mourning, emblazoned
with the family arms, the bells are
tolled two days, and all the clergy
and poor follow him to the grave,
with the most solemn rites of the
Catholic Church.</p>

<p>Marc Antoine, the second son of
Ogier de Gourgues, was a zealous
defender of the Catholic faith. He
travelled all through Europe in his
youth, studied theology at the Roman
college, and, gifted with uncommon
eloquence, though he did
not take Orders, held public controversies
against Calvinism and a
discussion with Scaliger, as is shown
by the eulogy at his funeral, which
took place at Bordeaux. Some
years after those public vindications
of the Catholic faith, he went to
England, where he was received
with great distinction by Queen
Elizabeth, a fact worthy of notice,
as the favor she manifested to Dominique
has been considered as an
argument in proof of his Protestant
proclivities. She liked to gather
around her men of certain celebrity,
and those who were in her good
graces were not always in sympathy
with her religious notions, as is
shown in the case of Marc Antoine.</p>

<p>Marc Antoine became Premier
President of the Parliament of Bordeaux,
and was charged with all the
preparations relative to the fulfilment
of the marriage between Louis XIII.
and the Infanta of Austria&mdash;a difficult
mission, because the Huguenots,
opposed to the alliance, were resolved
to frustrate it. M. O’Reilly, in his
<cite>Histoire de Bordeaux</cite>, says: “They
endeavored to seize the person of
the king in the environs of Guitre,
but he arrived at Bordeaux without
any disaster, thanks to the excellent
arrangements made by President
de Gourgues.”</p>

<p>Marc Antoine not only made
foundations in favor of the Jesuits
and Carmelites, but his second wife,
Olive de Lestonnac, left thirty thousand
livres to the Recollects of
Sainte Foy, to build a residence
where they could labor for the
conversion of the Huguenots. It
would seem as if every member of
the family were animated with a
particular zeal for the Catholic religion.</p>

<p>In 1690 we find Jacques Joseph
de Gourgues Bishop of Bazas.</p>

<p>After the foregoing proofs, no
possible doubt can be felt concerning
the stanch Catholicity of the
De Gourgues family. As for Dominique,
but little is known of his
life previous to his expedition to
Florida. Though he afterwards belonged
to the royal navy, it appears
that he first served on land and
took part in the Italian campaign
under Maréchal de Strozzi. His last
feat of arms in Italy, says one of
his biographers, was to sustain a
siege, in 1557, with thirty men against
a corps of Spanish troops. The
fort held was taken by assault, and
the garrison all slaughtered, except
De Gourgues, who was spared, to
be sent ignominiously to row on
the galleys. His boat being captured
by the Turks on the coast of
Sicily, he was taken to Rhodes and
thence to Constantinople. But his
fate was not changed; he continued
to serve in the galleys. Again putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">[708]</a></span>
to sea, he was taken and set
at liberty by Mathurin Romegas,
commander of the galleys of Malta
and Knight of S. John of Jerusalem.
The deliverer of the future
hero of Florida was likewise a Gascon.
His tombstone may still be
seen in the nave of the nuns’ church
of Trinità de’ Monti at Rome, the
inscription half effaced by the feet
of the worshippers.</p>

<p>Dominique now returned to
France, and after a voyage to Brazil
and the Indies, he entered the
service of the house of Lorraine,
who employed him on several private
occasions against the Huguenots.
His expedition to Florida
did not take place till the year
1567. We have seen him fighting
against the Spaniards in Italy, and
subjected by them to the utmost
degradation. It is not surprising
he burned to avenge the murder of
his companions-in-arms and the
severe treatment he had endured,
as well as to wipe out the stain on
the national honor caused by the
massacre of his fellow-countrymen
in Florida. He had too narrowly
escaped the Spanish sword himself
not to feel the deepest sympathy in
their fate. He afterwards drew up
himself an account of his expedition,
which is full of thrilling interest.
It has been published, but
the original is in the Bibliothèque
Impériale at St. Germain.</p>

<p>The establishment of a French
colony in Florida grew out of the
civil and religious contests of the
XVIth century. Admiral de Coligni,
with the view of providing
his co-religionists a safe asylum beyond
the seas, induced Charles IX.
to allow five or six hundred Huguenots
under Jean Ribault to embark
at Dieppe, Feb. 18, 1561, in
order to establish themselves in
Florida. They landed at the mouth
of the Rio San Mateo on the 1st
of May, and built a fort on an island,
which they called Fort Charles,
in honor of their sovereign. The
return of Ribault to France led to
a relaxation of discipline, and the
consequent ruin of the colony.
Other companies, also favored by
Coligni, were sent in 1564 and 1565,
under Laudonnière and the same
Ribault, to place the colony on a
better footing. Laudonnière secured
the friendship of the Indians,
whose chief, Satirova, hastened to
offer his support. But the destitution
to which the colony was reduced
weakened the attachment of
the natives, and some acts of piracy
exasperated the Spaniards, who regarded
them as intruders, and resolved
on their destruction.</p>

<p>Pedro Melendez appeared with
six vessels before Fort Caroline
and summoned Laudonnière and
Ribault to surrender, promising to
spare those who were Catholics,
but declaring all heretics should
be put to death. They defended
themselves valiantly, and even took
the offensive, and had it not been
for a tempest, perhaps bravery
would have won the day over the
number of the enemy. But we
need not give details which are
familiar to all. The fort fell into
the hands of Melendez, and all,
except Laudonnière and one of his
companions who evaded the search,
were put to death, “not as French,
but as heretics,” if we are to believe
an inscription left on the spot.
Nothing could be more horrible
than this atrocious murder of four
hundred inoffensive colonists. The
Spaniards even tore out the eyes
of their victims, stuck them on the
point of their daggers, and hurled
them against the French on the
water. The skin of Ribault was
sent to the King of Spain. And to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">[709]</a></span>
crown so barbarous a deed, they
heaped together the bodies of the
men, women, and children, and
kindling a great fire, reduced them
to ashes, with savage howlings.</p>

<p>Whatever the zeal of the Spanish
for the Catholic religion, we may
naturally suppose it was not the
only motive that animated them on
this occasion. Their eagerness to
take possession of the country and
fortify it, instead of requesting
Charles IX. to send a Catholic
colony to replace the Huguenots,
shows that other motives influenced
them. Religion was only a cloak.
Moreri, in his <cite>Dictionnaire Historique</cite>,
1712, says: “They hung the
French under the pretext they were
Lutherans.”</p>

<p>Laudonnière, who escaped, brought
the fearful details of this butchery
to France. The rage was universal.
Notwithstanding the antipathy
of the court to the religion of
the majority of the victims, it has
been too strongly asserted that all
sense of national honor was lost in
view of the religious aspect of the
case. The government of Charles
IX. was too weak to insist on complete
reparation, but his letters to
the French Ambassador at Madrid
prove he demanded Philip II.
should chastise those who were
guilty of the massacre.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> No reparation,
however, was made, and
the cruelties of Melendez not only
remained unpunished, but he was
loaded with honors.</p>

<p>Père Daniel, in his <cite>History</cite>, says:
“This inhumanity (of Melendez),
instead of being punished by the
government of Spain when complaint
was made, was praised, and
those who had a share in it rewarded.
The unhappy state of affairs
in the kingdom (France), in consequence
of the civil wars, prevented
the king from taking vengeance,
and three years passed away without
the court’s thinking of exacting
justice. Capt. Gourgues, a man
who sought to distinguish himself,
and loved glory more than anything
else, resolved to avenge the
insult to the French nation, and
without looking for any other reward
but success and renown, undertook
the expedition at his own
expense in spite of the danger and
every expectation of being disavowed
at court.… This deed, that
may be numbered among the most
memorable ever done of the kind,
wiped out the affront inflicted on
the French nation.”</p>

<p>And the account from the Imperial
library says: “The traitors
and murderers, instead of being
blamed and punished in Spain,
were honored with great estates
and dignities. All the French nation
expected such an injury to the
king and the whole nation would
soon be avenged by the public authorities,
but this expectation being
disappointed for the space of three
years, it was hoped some private individual
would be found to undertake
a deed so essential to the
honor and reputation of France.
There were many who would have
been glad of the renown to be won
by such an enterprise, but it could
not be undertaken without great
expense; the result, for many reasons,
was uncertain, hazardous, and
full of peril; and even if successfully
executed, it might not be exempt
from calumny. And it was
difficult to find any one willing to
incur this calumny by the loss of
his property, and an infinite number
of difficulties and dangers.”</p>

<p>It was not Laudonnière who went
to take vengeance on the Spaniards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">[710]</a></span>
It was no agent of Coligni’s. It
was not even one of the Huguenots,
though their brothers’ blood cried
from the ground, who lent his ear to
the terrible appeal. No; the brave
heart who atoned for the weakness
of the sovereign belonged to a devoted
Catholic family of the Landes.
It was a soldier who had served under
the Strozzi in Italy, and afterwards
under the Guises in France,
who lost sight of religious distinctions
in view of his country’s disgrace,
and nobly resolved to become
the avenger of the Huguenots.</p>

<p>Dominique de Gourgues began
his preparations early in the year
1567. He sold some of his property,
or, as stated by others, his
brother Ogier advanced the money
necessary for fitting out the expedition.
He armed two vessels small
enough to enter the large rivers, and
a patache which, when there was
lack of wind, could be propelled
by oars. He manned them with
eighty sailors and one hundred and
fifty soldiers, among whom we find
some of the noble, as well as plebeian,
names of Gascony. Monluc,
the governor of Bordeaux, allowed
him to depart on a pretended expedition
to the coast of Africa. It
was the 22d of August. De
Gourgues even concealed the object
of the voyage from his followers,
which shows how unreasonable
it is to regard them as Protestants
going to avenge a Protestant
cause, as many suppose. The names
of only a few of them are known,
and nothing in particular of these.
Capt. Cazenove, of a noble family
near Agen that still exists, commanded
one of the vessels. Another
is called Bierre by MM. Haag, and
De Berre by M. de Barbot, and one
of the captains of the Baron de la
Gardie’s galleys was named Loys de
Berre, of course a stanch Catholic.
But we see no reason for religious distinctions
in the case. The important
thing was to have brave, resolute
men. And it is certain they knew
nothing of the object of the expedition
till they arrived at Cape St. Antoine.
It is said when they learned
it, “they were at first surprised and
dissatisfied,” which does not look
much like sympathy for slaughtered
co-religionists. Parkman says:
“There (in Cuba) he gathered his
followers about him and addressed
them with his fiery Gascon eloquence.…
He painted with angry
rhetoric the butcheries of Fort
Caroline and St. Augustine. ‘What
disgrace,’ he cried, ‘if such an
insult should pass unpunished!
What glory to us if we avenge it!
To this I have devoted my fortune.
I relied on you. I thought you
jealous enough of your country’s
glory to sacrifice life itself in a
cause like this. Was I deceived?
I will show you the way; I will
be always at your head; I will bear
the brunt of the danger. Will you
refuse to follow me?’ The sparks
fell among gunpowder. The combustible
French nature bursts into
flame.”</p>

<p>There is not a word in this address
of their being Huguenots, though
free to express his sentiments at such
a distance from their native land.
The only appeal is&mdash;glory and
France.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to relate the
wonderful <i lang="fr">coup-de-main</i> by which the
three forts of the Spanish were taken.
Every one knows how he hung up
the thirty Spaniards who were left,
on the same trees on which his fellow-countrymen
had been hung, and
in place of the inscription left by
Melendez, he graved with a red-hot
iron on a pine slab: “This is
not done to Spaniards, but to treacherous
robbers and assassins.” One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[711]</a></span>
of these victims confessed the justice
of the act, as he had hung five of
the Huguenots with his own hand.</p>

<p>The <cite>Revue des Deux Mondes</cite> calls
the retaliation of the bold Landais
“savage,” and certainly grave moral
reasons can be brought against such
a proceeding. But everything was
exceptional in this historic episode,
and we must not regard it according
to the ideas of the present age.
The disinterested and heroic daring
of De Gourgues cannot be
denied, nor can any one help applauding
his patriotic wish to repair
the injured honor of the nation.
That he looked upon his deed as
one of righteous vengeance is sure.
How solemn and religious is his
language in addressing his followers
after his victory:</p>

<p>“My friends, let us give thanks
to God for the success he has
accorded to our enterprise. It was
he who saved us from danger in
the tempest off Cape Finibus Terræ,
at Hispaniola, Cuba, and the river
of Halimacany! It was he who
inclined the hearts of the savages to
aid us! It was he who blinded the
understanding of the Spaniards, so
they were unable to discover our
forces, or avail themselves of their
own! They were four to our one,
strongly intrenched, and well provided
with artillery, and supplies of
food and ammunition. We only had
justice on our side, and yet we have
conquered them with but little trouble.
It is not to our strength, but
to God alone we owe the victory.
Let us thank him, my friends, and
never forget the benefits we have
received from him. Let us pray
him to continue his favor towards
us, to guide us on our way back and
preserve us from all danger; pray
him also to vouchsafe to dispose
the hearts of men so that the many
dangers we have incurred and the
fatigues we have endured may find
grace and favor before our king and
before all France, as we had no
other motive but the service of the
king and the honor of our country!”</p>

<p>They set sail May 3, and arrived
at La Rochelle the 6th of June. De
Gourgues went immediately to Bordeaux
to render an account of his
voyage to Monluc, who, as Père
Daniel says, loaded him with praises
and caresses, which, with his antipathy
to Huguenotism, he would
hardly have done had De Gourgues
been a Huguenot in the service of
Huguenots. If the latter did not inform
him before his departure of the
object of his expedition, it was because
he knew Monluc was anxious
to avoid all occasion of rupture with
Spain. MM. Haag say Monluc had
received orders to forbid all expeditions
of the kind. And though De
Gourgues did not doubt the approbation
of the governor, he did not
wish to compromise him in the eyes
of the king.</p>

<p>De Gourgues received not only a
flattering welcome from Monluc but
the acclamations of the entire nation.
The wish for vengeance had been
universal, and he was applauded for
realizing it. Perhaps it was this outburst
of patriotism that forgot all
religious animosities which led that
sagacious diplomatist, François de
Noailles, at this very time Bishop of
Dax, a place not far from Mont-de-Marsan,
to assure the king the best
means of putting an end to the civil
dissensions of the country was to
declare war against Spain.</p>

<p>Had De Gourgues been a Huguenot
he would probably have disposed
of his war prizes at La Rochelle,
where he first touched, thereby rendering
his party a service by supplying
them with arms. Instead of that,
he took them to Bordeaux, and Monluc
bought them to arm the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">[712]</a></span>
against the Huguenots, as is shown
by existing documents estimating
their value, dated Aug. 27, 1568.</p>

<p>“This day appeared before me
Capt. Dominique de Gourgues requesting
the appraisement of nine
pieces of artillery, one cannon, a culverin,
and three <i lang="fr">moyennes</i>, which he
has brought to this said city from the
voyage he has lately made, and taken
in the fort the French had built, but
which was afterwards seized by one
Pierre Malendes, a Spaniard.…
Presented themselves before us to
make the said appraisement and
valuation: Antoine de Cassagnet,
lord of Cassagnet and Tilhadet,
Knight of the Order of the King,
and governor of the city and country
of Bordeaux in the absence of Sr.
de Monluc; Jehan de Monluc,
Knight of the Order of St. John of
Jerusalem, gentleman in ordinary of
the king’s chamber, and colonel of
the infantry of Guienne; Jacques
Descar, Knight of the Order of the
King, captain of fifty men-at-arms of
his ordinance, captain and governor
of the Château du Ha in the said
city and province of Guienne;
Charles de Monferrand, also Knight
of the Order of the King; Pierre de
Savignac, also Knight of the same
order; and Loys de Lur, Seigneur
d’Uza, whom, etc.”</p>

<p>All these persons to whom De
Gourgues thus confided his interests
were Catholic lords of Guienne,
whose religious convictions could
not be doubted, and with whom he
must have been on intimate terms to
induce them to take the trouble to
estimate the value of his war-prizes.</p>

<p>But it is said Charles IX. and his
court condemned De Gourgues’ act.
M. de Lacaze, in his biography,
says: “He received from his compatriots
the liveliest testimonies of
admiration and gratitude; but it was
not the same at court, where his
courage and achievements were rewarded
by ingratitude and persecution.
The Spanish ambassador demanded
his head, and the heroic
Frenchman was obliged to conceal
himself at Rouen to escape death.
He was living in a state bordering
on want when Queen Elizabeth offered
him command of a fleet she
was going to send to the assistance
of King Antonio of Portugal; but
enfeebled by age, chagrin, and fatigue,
Gourgues was unable to profit
by so brilliant an offer. He died on
his way to London.”</p>

<p>Many of these statements need
to be greatly modified, as we shall
show.</p>

<p>De Thou says: “At his return he
is badly received by the court, which
is <em>wholly Spanish</em>. The king treats
him as a disturber of the public
peace.”</p>

<p>There is no doubt the king feared
a rupture with Spain, in consequence
of the civil dissensions in his kingdom.
M. de Monluc, in his <cite>Commentaries</cite>,
alluding to his son’s expedition
to Africa, expressed a fear of
its leading to disturbance with Spain.
Personally, he desired war, but did
not wish him to draw upon himself
the censure of the government.
What he says explains the reception
of De Gourgues at a court where
Spanish influence predominated, and
leaves no doubt the latter was only
received as the son of Monluc himself
would have been, had he given
cause for war with Spain. He was,
however, soon honorably received
into service, for we find him, in
August, 1568, attached to the royal
navy; so he could not, as he states,
go to Dax, being “prevented by the
affairs of the king and the service of
the galleys.”</p>

<p>We find De Gourgues’ vessel, the
<cite>Charles</cite>, named in an act of October
22, 1568, in which it is said that Loys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">[713]</a></span>
de Lur, Vicomte d’Uza, was “general-in-chief
of the army, and of the
vessels <cite>Charles</cite>, <cite>Catherine</cite>, etc., which
will at once set sail by order of M.
de Monluc.” These vessels were to
guard the mouth of the Gironde.</p>

<p>There are still several documents
in the archives of the department of
the Gironde which refer to De Gourgues’
official duties at this time.
From them we give the following
extracts:</p>

<p>“Know all men that on this 14th
of March, 1572, appeared before me,
Jehan Castaigne, etc., for the purpose
of selling by these presents to
Dominique de Gourgues, squire and
gentleman in ordinary of the king’s
chamber, … four hundred quintals
of biscuit, good and salable, for
the sum of six livres and fifteen sols
for each of said quintals.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>…”</p>

<p>Arcère speaks of an armament fitted
out at Brouage by Philip de
Strozzi, as if to ravage the Spanish
coasts of America&mdash;a cloak to his
real design. He provided this fleet
with provisions, munitions of war,
etc., with no appearance of haste,
though so late in the season. Coligni,
therefore, was warned.</p>

<p>We find a letter from Charles IX.
to Dominique de Gourgues on the
subject, written fifteen days after St.
Bartholomew’s Day, when there was
no need of concealing his real designs:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Captain Gourgues</span>: As I have
written my cousin, the Sire de Strozzy,
to approve his appointing you to
go on a voyage of discovery, with
the general consent of the company,
I trust this letter will find you ready
to set sail. I beg to warn you, before
setting out, not to touch at any
place belonging to my brother-in-law,
or any prince friendly to me, and
with whom I am at peace. Above
all, fear to disobey me if you desire
my approbation, and the more, because
I have more need than I once
had of preserving the friendship of
all my neighbors. Conduct yourself,
therefore, wisely, and according to my
intentions, and I will remember the
service you do me. Praying God,
Captain Gourgues, to have you in his
keeping.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, September 14, 1572.”</p>

</div>

<p>This letter proves the king’s serious
intention of sending the fleet abroad,
and contains a somewhat severe
warning not to repeat his bold deeds
in Florida.</p>

<p>D’Aubigné declares that these vessels
were really intended to attack
the Spanish settlements in America,
but their destination was changed,
and they served at the siege of La
Rochelle, “to the great displeasure
of those who were hoping for a voyage
at sea.”</p>

<p>Arcère, in his <cite>Histoire de la Rochelle</cite>,
thus speaks of the <cite>Charles</cite> at
the siege of that city: “The king’s
fleet was composed of six galleys and
nine vessels. The largest of these
vessels was called the <cite>Charles</cite>. The
admiral’s, named the <cite>Grand Biscayen</cite>,
was under the Vicomte d’Uza, commander
of the fleet in the absence of
the Baron de la Gardie. Montgomery
advanced as if to engage in combat,
but he encountered full fire from the
enemy’s fleet; the vessel he commanded,
pierced by a ball, would
have sunk without speedy assistance,
and he decided to retreat.”</p>

<p>That Dominique de Gourgues was
in command of the <cite>Charles</cite> on this
occasion is proved by a document in
possession of the present Vicomte de
Gourgues, which states that Dominique,
by an act signed by the king
in council, August 10, 1578, was paid
the sum of seven thousand crowns
“for services rendered at and before
the siege of La Rochelle with his vessel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">[714]</a></span>
the <cite>Charles</cite>, and a patache called
the <cite>Desperada</cite>.”</p>

<p>This is the latest known document
referring to the public services of
Dominique de Gourgues. There is,
however, another letter from the
king referring to another service a
few years previous, and confirming
the fact that the <cite>Charles</cite> was under
his command: “Capt. Gourgues:
After deliberating about using some
of the largest and best vessels of my
navy before the city of La Rochelle&mdash;in
the number of which is the
<cite>Charles</cite>, which belongs to you&mdash;for
the embarkation of four thousand
soldiers intended for Poland, I have
concluded to send you this present
to notify you at once of my intention,
praying you above all, as you
love the welfare of my service, to
give orders that your vessel be equipped
as soon as it can be done, and
ordered to Havre de Grace, where it
is necessary to arrive by the 12th or
13th of August next; and, that you
arrive with greater security, it will be
expedient for your vessel to join the
others ordered on the same voyage,
that you may go in company to said
Havre. I beg you, therefore, to proceed
for this purpose to Bordeaux,
where the Sire de Berre is to despatch
twelve cannons and other
arms, that are also to go to said
Havre with all speed. Endeavor to
render the service I expect of you in
that place. Praying God that he
have you, Captain Gourgues, in his
holy and safe keeping,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Charles</span>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Gaillon</span>, July 2, 1573.”</p>

<p>Such are some of the records of
the public services of Dominique de
Gourgues after the Florida expedition.
Of course his achievements
were not rewarded as they should
have been. Pedro Melendez was
created marquis for his barbarous
deed and enriched with estates. The
brave Landais, who took vengeance,
merited far more. But, as we have
shown, he still remained in the king’s
service, and retained, or regained, his
confidence. And his exploit has
always been regarded as one of the
most brilliant episodes of French
history. Châteaubriand, blaming the
author of the <cite>Henriade</cite> for having
recourse to threadbare examples from
ancient times, says “the Chevalier
de Gourgues offered him one of the
most thrilling of episodes.”</p>

<p>We find a private paper dated
January 14, 1580, in which Dominique
de Gourgues gives Romarine de
Mesmes, <i lang="fr">damoyselle</i>, his aunt, power
and authority to receive the fruits,
profits, and emoluments of all his
cattle and real estate in the Vicomté
de Marsan, which shows that he did
not sell all his property to provide
for the expedition to Florida, or die
in want, as has been stated.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth of England offered
him command of a fleet to aid
Don Antonio of Portugal in the war
against Spain; but this honor is no
proof of his being regarded by her
as a Protestant, but rather of his
well-known hatred of the Spanish,
for it was to aid one Catholic nation
against another. It was on his way
to take command of this fleet that he
fell ill at Tours, in which he died in
the year 1583. He was buried with
honor in the abbatial church of S.
Martin of Tours&mdash;the crowning proof
that Dominique de Gourgues was a
genuine Catholic.</p>

<h3>THE LADDER OF LIFE.</h3>

<p>There are a great many rounds
in the ladder of life, though simple
youths have always fancied that a
few gallant steps would take them
to the summit of riches and power.
Now the top-round of this ladder
is not the presidency of any railroad
or country, nor even the possession
of renowned genius; for it
oddly happens that when one sits
down upon it, then, be he ever so
high up in life, he has really begun
to descend. Those who put velvet
cushions to their particular rounds,
and squat at ease with a view of
blocking up the rise of other good
folks, do not know they are going
down the other side of the ladder;
but such is the fact. Many thrifty
men have, in their own minds, gone
far up its life-steps, when, verily,
they were descending them fast;
and poor people without number
have in all men’s eyes been travelling
downward, though in truth they
have journeyed higher by descent
than others could by rising. So
many slippery and delusive ways
has this magical ladder that we
may say it is as various as men’s
minds. One may slip through its
rounds out of the common way of
ascent, and find himself going down
when he ought to be going up; and
vain toilers have ever fancied that
they were mounting to the clouds
when everybody else must have
seen they were still at the same
old rounds. Ambitious heroes have
made the same mistake, if indeed
the particular ladder which they
have imagined for themselves has
not itself been sliding down all the
while they have been seeking vainglory
by its steps.</p>

<p>The ladder of life is an infinite
ladder. It is full of indirections to
suit the abilities, and of attractions
to suit the tastes of climbers.
You may work at a forge, or sail
the sea, or trade in money and
goods, or hear operas, or write
romances, or wander over mountains,
or go to church, while living
thereon; but you must go up or
go down, and, anyway, you will
have some toiling to do. Everywhere
on the ladder is trouble save
in careful steps, and since human
progress is so illusory, many honest
persons rather feared to fall than
aspire.</p>

<h3>NEW PUBLICATIONS.</h3>

<div class="hanging">

<p><span class="smcap">The Spirit of Faith</span>; or, What must I
Do to Believe? Five Lectures delivered
at S. Peter’s, Cardiff, by the Right
Reverend Bishop Hedley, O.S.B. New
York: The Catholic Publication Society.
1875.</p>

</div>

<p>When we noticed these lectures last
month, we had not found time to do
more than glance at them. But having
since discovered their very uncommon
merit, we feel bound to let our readers
know it.</p>

<p>Never&mdash;we do not say seldom, but
never&mdash;have we seen such a happy combination
of simplicity with force. The
bishop’s English, by itself, is a treat.
His style has all the ease of conversation;
here and there rising into eloquence, or
delighting us with master-strokes of description
and illustration. Then, as to
the argument of his book, it is so amiable
and courteous that no one can take offence;
yet the points are put with stern
fidelity and driven home with ruthless
cogency.</p>

<p>The title speaks for itself. The “<em>spirit</em>
of faith” is precisely what is least understood
by non-Catholics; and again,
“What they must <em>do</em> to believe” is the
thing they most need to be shown.</p>

<p>When accused of being “mental
slaves,” etc., we justly reply that, on the
contrary, we are the freest of the free,
that “truth” alone “makes free”; but
perhaps we are apt to forget&mdash;or rather,
we fail to insist&mdash;that the “spirit of faith”
is, nevertheless, “a spirit of lowliness”
(as the bishop says)&mdash;“of childlike obedience,
and of ‘captivity’”; that there
must be “a taking up of a yoke, a bowing
of the head, a humbling of the heart.”
It will therefore do Catholics good, as
well as Protestants, to read the second
of these lectures on “What faith is.” So,
again, when allowing for the strength of
prejudice in alienating the Protestant
mind, we are in danger of false charity&mdash;by
forgetting that prejudice may easily be
<em>a sin</em>; and that <em>wilfulness</em> plays a large
part in popular “ignorance” nowadays.
The third and fourth lectures, on “Prejudice”
and “Wilfulness” as “Obstacles to
Faith,” are the best of their kind we remember
to have seen, and we are sure
that many Catholics need to read them&mdash;nor
only for the sake of their Protestant
friends.</p>

<p>But, of course, it is chiefly for the sake
of Protestant friends that we wish to see
these lectures in the hands of our readers.
The book is something for an earnest
man to go wild about. Its cost is little;
and we hope it will soon be scattered
broadcast over the land.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Religion and Science in their Relation
to Philosophy.</span> An Essay on
the Present State of the Sciences.
Read before the Philosophical Society
of Washington. By Charles W.
Shields, D.D., Professor of the Harmony
of Science and Revealed Religion
in Princeton College, N. J.
New York: Scribner, Armstrong &amp;
Co. 1875.</p>

</div>

<p>The trustees of Princeton College
have deserved commendation and given
a good example to other colleges by establishing
the chair filled by Dr. Shields.
The learned doctor is evidently applying
himself with zeal and industry to the
studies which will fit him to teach with
ability in his important branch of science&mdash;one
which demands an almost encyclopædic
knowledge of many sciences
specifically different from each other.
He informs us that he is preparing an
extensive work on the topics presented
in the essay before us, which is certainly
a most laudable undertaking, and one in
which we hope he may achieve a successful
and useful result. In the present
essay the author shows a very considerable
amount of reading and thought,
some skill in generalization, and a good
deal of that felicity of diction which is
requisite in making such abstruse
themes as those which relate to natural
and theological science attractive and
intelligible even to the mass of cultivated
persons.</p>

<p>The distinctive and principal thesis
defended by Dr. Shields is, that philosophy
is the only umpire to determine
controversies in which the opposing
parties advocate what are professedly
revealed and professedly scientific facts
or truths, respectively, in a mutually
destructive or hostile sense to each other.
To a certain extent, and in a correctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">[717]</a></span>
defined sense, we cordially agree with
him, and in this sense the high office of
philosophy, as the queen of all rational
science, is affirmed and defended by all
Catholic philosophers and theologians
worthy of the name. The five primary
natural sciences&mdash;physics, mathematics,
metaphysics, logic, and ethics&mdash;are certainly
none of them subaltern one to
another, yet the other four are subordinate
to metaphysics, because its object
has a precedence in the order of the knowable,
and its principles furnish the other
sciences with their rational foundation.
Nevertheless, it is evident, and must be
admitted by every one who believes in a
certain, clear, and surely ascertainable
revelation of facts and truths by God,
which is supernatural, that there is a
science above metaphysics in excellence&mdash;viz.,
theology, which dominates over it
in so far that the latter science cannot
reject any of its dogmas. The sciences
cannot therefore properly be said to be
separate from each other, although they
are really distinct. All rational sciences
are subalternated to one or more of the
five primaries, and thus subordinated to
metaphysics, which is subordinated to
theology. We consider that the author
is mistaken in asserting that a “healthful
separation and progress” marked
the first stage of the history of the
sciences since the Reformation. If
by separation he means distinction
only, and the free development in
each science of its own proper principles
by its proper methods, this
distinction was recognized and acted
on before the Reformation, as may be
seen by consulting the great master
of the schools, S. Thomas. Some of
the sciences have made great progress
since that event, not by means of,
but partly notwithstanding, their violent
and unnatural separation from
metaphysics and theology. In respect
to metaphysics and ethics, the Reformation
has produced one only direct
result, which is a miserable decadence
and retrogression, which seems to have
nearly reached its lowest term. The
sciences can only progress with full
liberty towards the perfection of human
knowledge when they exist in the due
harmony and subordination which their
nature demands and God has established.
The exposition of the order and relation
of scientific facts, principles, and deductions
in the universal realm of truth, as a
universal or encyclopædic science, must,
therefore, always place each one in its
due subordination, and cannot admit of
the umpirage of an inferior over a superior
science, much less of a revolt on the
part of the inferior. It is absurd to suppose
that the inferior tribunal of human
reason can judge a case in which the
judgment of God, who is the supreme
reason, or of an authority which God has
made supreme, comes up by appeal. Dr.
Shields objects that the great problems
in question cannot be settled by the
determination of Scripture, councils, the
Holy See, or any kind of ecclesiastical
decisions, because there is no agreement
respecting the true sense of Scripture, or
universal recognition of a competent and
unerring tribunal. To this we reply that
the construction of certain and complete
science is one thing, and the communication
of this science to the ignorant or erring
is another. Questions may be really
and definitively settled, though great
numbers of men may remain in culpable
or inculpable ignorance or error. The
<cite>Syllabus</cite> has settled all that it was intended
to settle, so far as the right of the
matter is concerned, and for the whole
body of men who submit to the infallible
authority of the Vicar of Christ. Our knowledge
is not in any way impaired by the
ignorance of those who are deprived of
the benefit of that instruction which
Catholics enjoy. But, when we come to
controversy, we cannot, of course, attempt
to convince or confute the ignorant or
erring by simply appealing to an authority
which the antagonist or objector, or
uninstructed inquirer, does not know or
recognize to be an authority. We cannot
assume the authority of God with an
atheist, of the Christian revelation with
an infidel, of the Catholic Church with a
Protestant. One of the fathers says, <i lang="la">Qui
fidem exigit, fidem astruat</i>, and Catholic
theologians have always acted on that
maxim. Dr. Shields, as a Protestant,
has no rational idea of a positive, theological
science. It is all mere controversy,
and we apprehend that his philosophy
will be found to be something equally
unsettled and incapable of settling itself.
It is a very dangerous thing for any kind
of dogmatic Protestantism to concede the
rights of reason, and especially so for
Calvinism. Princeton appears to be losing
the old, Presbyterian, Calvinistic
spirit, and going the way of the rest of
the world towards rationalism. We are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718">[718]</a></span>
not sorry for it, because we hope that the
cultivation and exercise of reason will
prepare the way for a great number of
intelligent and educated young men to
submit their minds to the rightful and
ennobling dominion of divine faith. Notwithstanding
the defects of Dr. Shields’
essay, we are glad to see him advocate
the study of philosophy and exalt its
dignity; for the search after the true philosophy
may lead many to find it, and
the true philosophy is the handmaid of
the true theology, and leads her votaries
to the feet of her mistress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An Elementary Treatise on Physical
Geography.</span> By D. M. Warren.
Revised by A. von Steinwehr. Philadelphia:
Cowperthwait &amp; Co.</p>

</div>

<p>This book is one which Catholic teachers
should never think of using, and
against which Catholic children should,
as far as possible, be specially warned,
should it be introduced in any school
which they are obliged by circumstances
to attend.</p>

<p>It is probable that the chapter on
ethnography, which is specially objectionable,
is the composition of the reviser.
At least we should so infer from the stupid
arrogance which crops out in its last
sentence, and which is characteristic of
the Prussia of to-day, intoxicated with a
temporary success which was, as any
careful student of history will conclude,
intended for the purification of France
rather than for the exaltation of her opponent.
“The present historical period,”
he says, “is directed by the Germanic
Aryans, who are the leaders of modern
Christian civilization.” Comment is unnecessary.
We venture to say that few
of our or anybody else’s readers have
ever come across anything more impudent
or absurd. It is an insult to the
American people, Catholic or non-Catholic,
to palm off on them such stuff as this.</p>

<p>He also implies in another place that
the German nation “worked out its own
civilization.” We have not heard of any
nation that has done that, but that the
Germans did not is too manifest to admit
of argument.</p>

<p>The principal objection to the chapter,
however, is the publication, without note
or comment of course, of two heresies with
regard to the origin of the human race,
as being equally entitled to acceptance
with the Mosaic account. One of these is
its origin from different original pairs, the
other what is commonly known as Darwinism.</p>

<p>It is not worth while to give a more
extended notice to a book of this sort.
This species of book can be turned off by
any person with a smattering of science
who has the leisure for authorship, and
who can find a publisher. The market
is flooded with such. We should not have
said anything about it had not our attention
been called to it by a friend on account
of its dangerous character.</p>

<p>It is high time that we had a complete
series of really Catholic text-books which
would need no correction, either in their
matter or in the spirit in which they are
written. We could put up even with inferior
ones for the sake of religion and
the faith of our young people; but we
should not have to try very hard to come
up to the standard of such books as the
one just noticed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New Practical Meditations</span> for Every
Day in the Year, on the Life of Our
Lord Jesus Christ. Chiefly intended
for the use of Religious Communities.
By the Rev. Father Bruno Vercruysse,
S.J. The only complete English translation.
New York and Cincinnati:
Benziger Brothers. 1875.</p>

</div>

<p>We have seen several books of meditations,
but none so <em>business-like</em> as this.
The practice of mental prayer is by no
means easy to everybody, and needs
much explanation and suggestive aid.
Now, many of the manuals which are offered
as guides prove unsatisfactory to
the user by either suggesting too little or
making the meditation for him. In the
work before us we see nothing of this
kind to regret. The plan is in many respects
new. Indeed, the author calls special
attention to the preface in which he
explains his method.</p>

<p>Though “chiefly intended for religious
communities,” these meditations are well
adapted for private individuals, both ecclesiastic
and lay. Moreover, a single
“point” of each meditation will be found
sufficient by itself for those who have not
time for more. The work is also “enriched
by several Novenas and Octaves;
Meditations for the First Friday of every
month, and for the days of Communion;
… a new method of hearing Mass,
and practical remarks on the different
parts of meditations; a plan of Jerusalem
with a map of Palestine, showing the different
localities mentioned throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719">[719]</a></span>
the work, and an alphabetical table of
contents, and of meditations on the Gospels
of the Sundays.” Also, for religious,
“Exercises preparatory to the renewal
of vows, and for a retreat of eight
days.”</p>

<p>Lastly, the approbation of his eminence
Cardinal Deschamps, Archbishop
of Mechlin, speaks in unequivocal terms
of the work’s merit. “These Meditations,”
he says, … “are remarkable for
the solidity of doctrine, the happy choice
of subjects, and unctuous piety. The
use of them cannot fail to be very profitable
to religious communities, to ecclesiastics,
and to those pious persons in
the world who aspire to perfection.”</p>

<p>Annexed also is the approbation of
Father Charaux, S.J., Superior-General
of the Mission of New York and Canada;
together with extracts from three letters
of Father Beckx, the General of the Jesuits,
to the author.</p>

to Young Ladies who have Completed
their Education. Translated
from the fourth French edition by a
Sister of St. Joseph. Philadelphia: P.
F. Cunningham. 1875.</p>

</div>

<p>There is no doubt that this book, written
in a tone of genuine affection and interest, and
addressed to young ladies who
have completed their education, is one
that might profitably be put into the
hands of those for whom it was written
and translated. The only question seems
to be how best to commend it to their
attention; for in these days of varied and
indiscriminate reading, the advice or recommendation
of older people is seldom
asked, and a hurried glance at the contents
of a book is often sufficient to cause
its rejection, as prosy or unattractive.</p>

<p>To young ladies, also, who enjoying
in a happy home the merited confidence
of their parents, and accustomed to few
restrictions from them, the minute and
careful instructions and directions found
in some of the chapters might perhaps
seem superfluous and a little amusing.
Yet, when they read the dedication, and
recognize the fact that the book was written
under the eyes, as it were, of the
Blessed Virgin, with the approbation of
her who was the truest lady as well as
the purest woman in the world, they will
be disposed to accept with more humility
and gratitude suggestions which they
must feel, if followed, would render them
more truly her imitators, more worthy of
the name of her children.</p>

<p>To those who have had the privilege
and happiness of a convent education,
this book is of course appropriate. It
will bring to their minds the gentle
teaching of those peaceful days, and act
as a kind of charm in recalling holy aspirations
and resolutions. Especially
will they welcome it as proving the tender
interest of their former teachers,
which, though no longer folded around
them like a mantle, now attracts their attention,
as a signal waved from a secure
haven, to encourage their frail barks, as
they push out on the uncertain waves of
life.</p>

<p>Thoughtful minds are glad to find in a
book a companion and friend; to such,
and as such, we recommend this valuable
Bequest.</p>

By Minnie Mary Lee. Baltimore:
Kelly, Piet &amp; Co. 1875.</p>

</div>

<p>We again welcome the author of <cite>The
Heart of Myrrha Lake</cite> to the field
of Catholic literature. The writer possesses
many of the qualifications most
essential to a writer of fiction&mdash;skill in
the construction of plots, ability to read
character at sight, and a certain raciness
and vivacity of style, which holds the
reader’s attention from first to last, and
gives her the preference over some writers
of greater artistic finish. In this is indicated
our chief criticism and regret&mdash;that
one so well qualified should neglect that
attention to detail which characterizes
the perfect artist. Not that we would
advocate anything stiff or “artificial,”
for true art is always in harmony with
nature. It is precisely these exuberances
and inaccuracies which cause the
writer subsequent annoyance, and for
which the critical eye is needed, to prune
and correct. The plot of <cite>Herbert’s Wife</cite>,
though simple, abounds in vivid pictures
of real life, and its incidents serve the
moral purpose of the story admirably.
We do not doubt that each succeeding
effort will exhibit less and less of the
defect alluded to.</p>

<p>The six volumes we have seen of this

have too many books which are attractive

made by competent hands, and the pictures
have much greater pretensions to being
termed illustrations than many which
are made to do duty in that capacity.
We think, however, that the publishers’

could have produced better work than
the letter-press and “imitation cloth”

<h3>THE RIGHTS OF THE CHURCH OVER EDUCATION.<br />
<span class="smaller">FROM LES ETUDES RELIGIEUSES, ETC.</span></h3>

<p>Of all the questions which preoccupy&mdash;and
justly&mdash;public opinion,
and on which war is declared
against the Catholic Church, one
of the most vital is that of education.</p>

<p>“It is certain that instruction is,
in fact, the great battle-field chosen
in our days by the intelligent enemies
of the faith. It is there they
hope to take captive the youth of
France, and to train up future generations
for impiety and scepticism.
And it must be admitted that they
conduct this war with a skill which
is only equalled by their perseverance.”<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>We endeavored to point out, in a
former article, the intentions of the
enemies of the church, the depth
of the abyss they are digging for
Christian society, and the infernal
art which they have shown in combining
their plan of attack.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Since
then, a first success has befallen
them to justify their hopes and inflame
their ardor. We may expect
to see them increase their efforts to
carry the fortress. Why should
they not succeed when they have
opposed to them only divided forces?</p>

<p>Happen what may, however, we
must remain true to ourselves. It
is our duty to hold fast the standard
of our faith, in spite of the
contradictions of human reason;
and to oppose to the pagan error,
that the state is master of education,
the Christian truth, that the
church alone is endowed with the
power to educate the young.…
The opponents of the church on this
point are of two classes. One consists
of those who never belonged
to her, or who do so no longer;
the other, of those who still call
themselves her children. The
former are principally Protestants,
and those philosophical adversaries
of revelation who deny, with more
or less good faith, Catholic doctrine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">[722]</a></span>
and pretend to find nothing
in it but illusion and blind credulity.
These are, it must be owned,
consistent with themselves when
they refuse to the church the rights
she claims over education. Their
logic is correct; but it is the logic
of error, and to contend with such
adversaries we should have to begin
with a proof of Christianity.
That is not our object. Whatever
may be their error, however, on the
subjects of Christian revelation and
the church, we hope to be able to
convince them that a spirit of encroachment
and ambition of rule
has no part in the pretensions of
the church, in the matter of the
education of the young. Rather,
they ought to acknowledge, with
us, that therein we only fulfil a
duty the most sacred, the most inviolable&mdash;that
of conducting Christian
souls to their supreme and
eternal destiny.</p>

<p>But what is far less excusable is
the inconsistency of certain Catholics.
They are persuaded, they say,
of the truth of the Catholic religion;
they profess to believe her doctrine,
to submit to her authority;
and yet one sees them make common
cause with the enemies of their
faith in repudiating all control of
the church in questions of instruction
and of education. It is for
these especially we write, in the
hope of convincing them that, in
challenging for herself not only
complete liberty to teach her children
divine and human science, but
also the moral and religious direction
of all Christian schools, the
Catholic Church claims nothing but
what is her right, and pretends to
nothing more than the legitimate
exercise of a necessary and divine
power. Would that they could
understand, in short, that no Catholic
can, without inconsistency and
without a kind of apostasy, assent to
the exclusion of the Church from
the supervision of instruction, and
to the whole of it being directed
by the sole authority of the civil
power!</p>

<h4>I.&mdash;THE PRINCIPLES OF SOLUTION IN THE
PRESENT QUESTION.</h4>

<p>The whole Christian theory of
education rests on the following
twofold truth taught by the Catholic
Church: that man is created by
God for a supernatural end, and that
the church is the necessary intermediary
between man and his supreme
destiny. These two points
cannot be admitted without admitting,
also, that the church is right in
all the rest. Unfortunately, nothing
is less common than the clear understanding
of these truths, essential
as they are to Christianity. It
will, therefore, not be unprofitable
to take a brief survey of them.</p>

<p>The Christian religion does not
resemble those philosophical theories
which an insignificant minority
of the human race have been discussing
for three thousand years
without arriving at any conclusion,
and which have no practical issue
for the rest of mankind. Its aim, on
the contrary, is essentially practical.
From the first it addresses itself,
not to a few persons of the highest
culture, but to all indifferently, rich
and poor, learned and ignorant. It
is designed for every one, because
every one has a soul, created in the
image of God, and because this soul
religion alone can save&mdash;that is to
say, conduct to its ultimate end,
by rendering it at last conformable
to its divine type, to the infinite
perfections of God. But especially
is Christianity practical, because,
without any long discussions, it says
to every one of us, “I am the voice
of God revealing to men truths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">[723]</a></span>
which it is their duty to believe,
virtues which it is their duty to
practise in this life in order to deserve,
after death, everlasting happiness
in the very bosom of God.
Here are my credentials; they
affirm the mission I have received
from on high. Believe, then, the
Word of God; practise his precepts,
and you will be saved.” Her
credentials having been verified, it
comes to pass that multitudes of
men yield faith to the teachings of
Christianity as coming from God;
they place themselves under her
obedience, and the Christian society
is founded, with its hierarchy,
its object clearly defined, and its
special means determined by Jesus
Christ, its divine founder.</p>

<p>But is it all, and will it be sufficient
to call one’s self Christian, to
be enrolled in the number of believers,
to have received baptism,
and to practise with more or less
fidelity the precepts of the divine
and ecclesiastical law? To suppose
that it is, is the fatal error of
a number of modern Christians, as
unacquainted with their religion as
they are lukewarm in fulfilling its
duties. Thus understood, would
Christianity have done anything
but add to the religions of
the philosophers incomprehensible
mysteries, exceedingly troublesome
practices, and ceremonies as meaningless
to the mind as useless to
the soul? Far from this, Christianity
is itself, also, radical after
its fashion. It deprives man of
nothing which constitutes his nobility;
it enriches it rather. It
does not oppose his legitimate aspirations
for what is great, for what
is beautiful; it hallows them rather.
It does not deny him the
gratification of any of his loftier
and more generous instincts; it
only supplies them with an object
infinitely capable of contenting
them. In a word, it does not destroy
nature; it transforms and deifies
it, by communicating to it a
supernatural and divine life.</p>

<p>What is life in mortal man but
the movement of all his powers in
quest of an object which gives
them happiness? Well, then, Christianity
lays hold of these human
powers, and, in order to transform
them, it infuses into them a
new principle, which is grace&mdash;that
is, the virtue of God uniting itself
to the soul; it places a higher end
before them&mdash;the possession of
God in his own essence, an infinite
object of knowledge and of
love; it enables them, indeed, to
bring forth works not possible to
our frail nature without a divine
illumination which enlightens the
intelligence, and without a holy inspiration
which strengthens and assists
the will. It is a completely
new man grafted on the root of the
natural man. It is a new way of
living, wherein, under the influence
of a supernatural and divine principle,
our feelings become purified
by finding their source in God,
our knowledge enlarges, because it
penetrates even into the mysteries
of the divine essence, and our love
becomes limitless as God himself,
the only true good, whom we love
in himself, and in his creatures,
the reflex of himself.</p>

<p>We know well that rationalistic
philosophy, when it hears us speak
of a divine life, of union with God
by a higher principle than nature,
shrugs its shoulders, and with
superb self-complacency rings the
changes on the words illusion, mysticism,
extravagance. But what
matter? Has it ever, like us, had
any experience of this second life
of the soul, so as to understand its
reality and its grandeur? Its God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">[724]</a></span>
silent and solitary, exists only for
reason. He will never issue from
his eternal repose. He will not
meddle with his creatures to constitute
their happiness. This is
not the God to satisfy our nature,
thirsting for the infinite. He is not
the God of Christianity whom we
have learned to know and to love.</p>

<p>But to return to the church.
Manhood is not the work of a day.
Thirty years at the least pass away before
the human being arrives at maturity,
passing successively through
the stages of infancy, boyhood, and
youth. What care, what pains, and
what active solicitude are needed
for his education! A mother, a father,
a master, devote themselves
to it by turns. Fortunate if, after
all, these efforts are crowned with
success! Is it to be said that it
costs less time and labor to bring a
soul to spiritual maturity, to raise
it to the perfection of this divine
life? A day, a year&mdash;will they suffice
to enlighten the intelligence
with truths it must believe, to instruct
it in obligations it must fulfil,
but, above all, to form in it a
habit of all those virtues it is bound
to practise? Or is its education
so different from the natural education
that it can dispense with an
instructor? Will the child, unaided,
raise itself to God&mdash;we mean to
the highest degree of moral perfection,
of Christian sanctity? It
would be folly to suppose it. It
needs, therefore, a master; some
one charged with the duty of teaching
it truth, of forming it in virtue.
Who is this instructor? Is it any
other than that one to whom Jesus
Christ, the divine but invisible
Master, once said, “As my Father
has sent me, I send you. Go then,
teach all nations; teaching them to
observe my whole law.” This instructor
is the church, represented
by her pastors, the lawful successors
of the apostles.</p>

<p>This principle must be borne in
mind, this indisputable truth of revealed
doctrine. We shall see the
consequences of it presently. We
assert that the church, and the
church alone, has received from
Jesus Christ the power of forming
the supernatural man&mdash;the Christian
in the full force of that term. No
one else can pretend to it. Not
the state, with its power; not private
individuals, with their knowledge,
however great; not even the
father or mother of the family,
great as is the authority over their
children’s souls with which God has
invested them. And wherefore?
Because the church alone possesses
the means indispensable for a Christian
education.</p>

<p>These means are of three kinds.
In the name of God, the church
gives truth to the understanding;
she imposes a law on the will; and
she dispenses grace, without which
the Christian would lack power to
believe the truth and to fulfil the
law. Withdraw these things, and
Christian education ceases to exist.
You deliver up the understanding
to human opinions; therein it loses
faith. The will becomes a law to itself;
that is to say, it has no other
law to guide it than its own caprices
and passions; and then, the
moral force disappearing, man in
the face of duty is oftener than not
powerless to fulfil it. Now, who is
it whom God has charged with the
duty of preserving amongst men,
and of communicating to every
generation the treasure of revealed
truths? Who is it who represents
on earth the divine power, and has
the right of enlightening consciences
on the subjects of justice and
injustice, of right and wrong?
Whom, in short, has Jesus Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">[725]</a></span>
appointed minister of his sacraments
to distribute to souls the supernatural
succors of grace? The
church, and the church alone. To
her have all generations of mankind
been entrusted throughout the progress
of the ages, in order that she
may bring them forth to spiritual
life, and form in them Jesus Christ,
the divine model whom Christian
education ought to reproduce in
every one of us. It is, then, true
that the formation of the supernatural
man, of the Christian, is the
proper ministry of the church;
that this ministry constitutes a part
of her essential functions; that it is,
in a sense, her whole mission on
earth; so much so, that she could
not abdicate it without betraying her
trust, without abandoning the object
of her mission, and overthrowing the
whole work of Christianity.</p>

<p>This is a fundamental principle
which no sincere Catholic could
think of rejecting, so solidly is it
based on revelation, and so conformable
is it to the principles of
faith. There remains, consequently,
only to deduce from it its consequences,
and to point out how the
whole claim of power over the instruction
and education of Christian
youth which the church asserts
flows from it as a necessary and
logical deduction. Now the church
herself having been careful to determine
the rights which belong to
her, it is her word we shall take for
our guide, it is her doctrine we
propose to defend. It is clearly
annunciated in the Encyclical
<cite>Quanta Cura</cite>, and in the <cite>Syllabus</cite>,
the most authentic exposition of the
mind of the church on all the disputed
questions of the day, as it is the
most assailed.</p>

<h4>II.&mdash;POSITION OF THE QUESTION.</h4>

<p>For nearly three centuries the
government of France has labored
with indefatigable persistency and
energy to concentrate in its hands
all the social powers, and to constitute
itself, as it were, the universal
motive-cause in the state. Autonomy
of provinces, communal
franchises, individual or collective
precedence in certain great public
services, all have successively disappeared
before the continual encroachments
of the central power.
Thus the state is no longer a living
organism of its own life, at once
manifold and ordered. It has become
a huge mechanism, whose
thousands of wheels, inert and powerless
of themselves, move only at the
impulse of the centre of the motive
forces. To make of society a kind
of human machine may be the ideal
of a certain materialist and socialist
school. It has never been the idea
of Christianity. We Christians
have too much regard for our personal
dignity, we know too well the
limits of the functions of the civil
power, thus to abdicate all spontaneity,
all precedence of our own,
and to consent to become nothing
but mere parts of a machine, when
we can be, and ought to be, activities
full of life and movement.</p>

<p>In the matter of education especially,
what errors have not been
committed, of what usurpations has
not the civil power incurred the
guilt? By the creation of an official,
pattern university, monopolizing
instruction, and subject exclusively
to the direction of the government,
all the authorities to whom
belonged formerly the instruction
and education of youth have been
suppressed at one blow. There is
no longer any right recognized, any
action suffered, but that of the state,
master both of school and pay.
Everything by the state, everything
for the state, this through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">[726]</a></span>
long weary years has been the undiscussable
maxim against which
Catholic consciences, little disposed
to sacrifice their right to the usurped
power of the government, struggled
in vain.</p>

<p>At last, thanks to the persistent
protest of those consciences, so
long despised; the principle has lost
its pretended obviousness, and the
fact itself has received its first
check&mdash;sure prelude of its approaching
disappearance. The moment
seems to have arrived when those
who have the right ought to claim
their legitimate share in the exercise
of a function eminently social.
Now all have a right here. The
government has its rights; as responsible
for the good and evil
which befall society; for the evil,
to check and prevent it; for the
good, to help in effecting it. The
church has her rights, because she
is the great moral power in society,
and there is question here, pre-eminently,
of a moral function.
The family has its rights, for it is
its fruit which has to be reared and
instructed. Individuals, even, have
their rights&mdash;the right of devotion
and sacrifice in behalf of a holy
work, and of a ministry which,
more than any other, stands in need
of those graces.</p>

<p>Here are, assuredly, enough of
rights, despised for three-quarters
of a century, and swallowed up in
the insatiable power of the state.
It would be a deed worthy of our
generation to re-establish all in
their original and proper order. It
is being attempted, we know, and
already the National Assembly<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> has
begun to concede an instalment of
justice to the family and to individuals.
But the church! Why is
silence kept concerning her? Why
is it sought to exclude her from the
debate, and to treat her claims as
null and void? We Catholics cannot
accept this disavowal of our
rights. It concerns us to ascertain
what place they propose to assign
to our church in the modern state.
We should like to know whether we
still belong to a Christian society,
or must prepare to defend the
rights of our conscience in a state
decidedly pagan.</p>

<p>What are these rights? What
do we demand for the church?
What position, in short, do we wish
to see her assume in all that concerns
the education of youth?
Such are the questions we propose
to solve. We will state them with
yet more precision. When there is
question of the rights of the church
in communities, three hypotheses
are possible according to the different
conditions of those communities.
We may suppose a state religiously
constituted&mdash;that is to say,
wherein the gospel and Christianity
are not only the rule of life and the
religion of individuals, but, besides,
the foundation of legislation, the
worship adopted in the manifestations
of public piety; whatever may
be, in other respects, the general
aspect of the relations established,
by common consent, between the
church and the state.</p>

<p>In opposition to this first hypothesis
there exists another&mdash;that
of a civil society, wherein the religious
authority and the political
authority have the appearance of
ignoring one another; wherein the
state affects indifference with regard
to all religions, fosters no one
of them, and, limiting its action exclusively
to the material interests
of the community, leaves individuals
to embrace and practise whichever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727">[727]</a></span>
of the worships suits them best.
To borrow the popular formula,
such a constitution would realize
“a free church in a free state”; or,
more exactly, “a state separated
from the church.”<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Lastly, modern times have given
birth to a third kind of political
constitution, a mean between the
two preceding ones, in which
Catholicity is no longer the base
of the social edifice in preference
to every other religion, and is only
one of the public worships recognized
by the state; at times that
of the majority of the citizens, and
observed as such in the religious
solemnities in which the government
takes a part. In this hypothesis,
the state remains religious,
but it is neither Catholic nor Protestant.
A Christianism vague and
general enough to lend itself to all
communions, a kind of rational
deism, rather, inspires its legislation;
honor is done to ministers
of recognized worships, and when
government feels a need of betaking
itself to God, in order to implore
his mercy, or to give him
thanks for his blessings, it orders
prayer in all the places of worship
without distinction. Manifold, as
may be supposed, are the shades
of difference in the manner of constituting
a state of such indefinite
religious forms. It is nevertheless
true that the greater number of our
modern constitutions reproduce,
more or less, the type we have just
sketched. Are we to see in this
merely a kind of transition between
ancient communities, which almost
all realized the first hypothesis, and
the communities of the future?
Or will the state, separated from
the church, organize itself and govern
itself in a complete independence
of all religion? This is the
dream of our free-thinkers. For
the happiness of humanity, we hope
it will not be realized.</p>

<p>In addition to these three hypotheses
there remains the state persecutor
of the church. But although
this is by no means uncommon
in these days, it does not enter
into our present subject; which is
limited to determining the rights
and action of the church in a tranquil
and, up to a certain point,
regular state of things.</p>

<p>Further, Christianity being to us
truth, and the Catholic Church
the only true Christianity, it evidently
follows that the first hypothesis
constitutes the normal state
of society, that in which it attains
its end with the greatest perfection
by the most abundant and most
appropriate means. Religion, in
short, is as necessary to communities
as to individuals; and of all
religions, only the true one can be
a real element of the prosperity of
states.</p>

<p>The problem to solve, then, is as
follows: First to examine and determine
the rights which belong to
the church in a well-organized society&mdash;that
is to say, in a Christian
or Catholic society. Then, when
we know the better, the more perfect,
to lay down the necessary and
the possible, in communities where
human passions have made for the
church an inferior position, but
little favorable to the full exercise
of her rights.</p>

<h4>III.&mdash;CHRISTIAN EDUCATION IN A CHRISTIAN
STATE.</h4>

<p>The Jews in this resembled, to a
certain extent, a Christian&mdash;that is
a Catholic&mdash;people; namely, that
amongst them one of the tribes had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">[728]</a></span>
been chosen by God to be wholly
consecrated to his service, and to
be devoted exclusively to the ministry
of the altars. So also, but
with the difference demanded by
the new conditions of the priesthood,
God chooses amongst the
faithful his clerics, divinely called to
exercise the sacerdotal functions;
for under the New Law, as under the
Old, no one can pretend to this
honor unless he be called of God.
Here, then, are two categories of
individuals in the nation; those
who, by divine vocation, are destined
for the service of the church,
and those who continue in the ordinary
condition of Christians&mdash;the
ecclesiastics and the laics. The
distinction is necessary, because
the church does not claim the same
rights in regard to both.</p>

<p><i>The Rights of the Church over
the Education of Clerics.</i>&mdash;The education
of clerics&mdash;of young men,
that is, who devote themselves
to the ecclesiastical ministry&mdash;has
always been the object of the
liveliest solicitude of the church.
Solely anxious to see the knowledge
of the faith and true piety flourish
among the faithful entrusted to her
care, could she forget that people
conform themselves to the model
of those who govern them, and
that the essential condition for enlightening
understandings in the
truths of religion, as well as for
inclining their hearts to the practice
of Christian virtues, is first to
fashion a clergy solidly instructed
and sincerely pious? In Thomassin<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
may be found innumerable examples
testifying to the solicitude
of the church on the subject of
schools wherein young clerics are
instructed. But the most solemn
act, and the most prolific in happy
results, that has been accomplished
for this object, is, without contradiction,
the decree of the holy
Council of Trent, directing all the
bishops, metropolitans, and other
pastors charged with the government
of the church to erect, each
in their respective dioceses, a house
or seminary for the purpose of
lodging there, of instructing in ecclesiastical
science, and bringing
up in ecclesiastical virtue, the children
of the town, diocese, or province,
who shall show signs of a
true divine vocation.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>At the same time that it directs
the institution of seminaries, the
council is at the pains to explain
their great usefulness, the necessity,
even, of them for the church, as
the only efficacious means of always
providing zealous as well as
solidly instructed ministers. It
lays down also the way of life which
should be observed within them,
the studies to which especially the
young men should devote themselves,
the means to be employed
by the masters for the complete
education of their pupils, and even
the resources of which the bishops
will be able to avail themselves to
help to defray the expenses of these
precious schools.</p>

<p>It may have been already remarked
how the council regulates
everything of its own authority and
without asking aught of secular
powers. It proves the church’s
right to herself alone institute and
organize her ecclesiastical seminaries.
But that which decisively
manifests her mind on this point
is the care which the Council of
Trent takes to place the entire administration
of these schools in the
hands of the bishops, assisted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729">[729]</a></span>
two of the oldest and most prudent
of the cathedral chapter, chosen by
them under the inspiration of the
Holy Ghost.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Such is the authority
to which belongs exclusively the
right of regulating all that concerns
the education of clerics. Neither
can the lay faithful, nor Christian
families, nor, still less, governments,
meddle at all with this work, which
is exclusively the affair of the
church. Accordingly, in the forty-sixth
proposition of the <cite>Syllabus</cite>,
the Sovereign Pontiff, Pius IX., has
reproved, proscribed, and condemned
the doctrine of those who pretend
“to subject to civil authority
the method to be followed in the
theological seminaries.”</p>

<p>The church claims, then, complete
liberty to choose her ministers herself,
and to form them in the manner
which seems to her most desirable.
This is no privilege which
she asks of the state, it is a right
which she holds from Jesus Christ,
and by his divine appointment:
the right of existing, the right of
perpetuating herself upon earth by
keeping up her hierarchy of teaching
pastors and faithful taught, and
in recruiting from among the latter
those whom God himself calls to
the honors of the priesthood.</p>

<p>And, in truth, to what rights
over the education of clerics can a
civil government pretend? Is it to
judge of the knowledge which is
necessary for the ministers of the
altar? But is not the church appointed
by Jesus Christ the sole
guardian of revealed truth, and has
not she alone received the mission
of teaching the peoples? Can it be,
indeed, to discern in the subjects
who present themselves a divine
vocation, and the degree of virtue
requisite for a priest? But for
such discernment, has, then, the
civil power the special illumination
of the Holy Ghost? Does it know
the mysterious action of grace in
the soul, and does God reveal to it
his secrets? Or can it be, as some
governments have not been afraid
to do, to determine the number of
young men who ought every year
to respond to the call of God and
enrol themselves in the sacred
army? Impious and sacrilegious
pretension! which says to the Spirit
of God, “Thus far shall your inspirations
go, and no farther.” As if
the state, and not God, were the
judge of the church’s needs! As
if the civil power had received from
Jesus Christ the commission to fix
annually in the budget the effective
of men employed in his divine
service, after the same fashion as it
regulates the annual contingent of
soldiers called to the service of the
state!</p>

<p>But no, not one of these pretensions
is tenable. The state has no
power whatever over the education
of clerics; and the church, by its
divine institution, is alone competent
for this work, necessary above
all to its existence and the perpetuity
of its action in the world.</p>

<p>Such are the rights of the church
in this first department of education.
They are absolute, exclusive,
and inalienable. What have we
next to say of those she possesses
in the education of the laity?</p>

<p><i>The Rights of the Church over
Public Education.</i>&mdash;That which
certain Catholics refuse to the
church, even in a community
Christianly constituted, is not the
right of giving instruction in the
public schools, and making her
influence felt there to the advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_730" id="Page_730">[730]</a></span>
of the morality and good education
of the youth. No one but a
rationalist or free-thinker can deny
the necessity of making religion
the foundation of all education, if
we would bring up Christians, and
not unbelievers. More than this,
these same Catholics acknowledge,
besides, that the church by her
priests, and her religious devoted
to the education of youth, enjoys
the right possessed by all citizens
of opening public schools and
teaching, not only the verities of
the Catholic faith, but letters and
human science in all its branches.
They are generally advocates of
freedom of instruction to its utmost
extent; and the power they
accord to the humblest citizen they
do not commit the folly of refusing
to those whose character, knowledge,
and disinterestedness best
qualify them for those delicate
functions.</p>

<p>Here, then, are two acknowledged
rights of the church, on which we
need not insist further. First, the
right of providing religious instruction
for the youth at school, and
their education according to the
principles of Christian morality.
Secondly, the right of giving, herself,
to children and to young people,
whose families entrust them to
her, a complete education, embracing
instruction in letters and in the
secular sciences; the right, consequently,
of founding religious congregations
entirely consecrated to
the ministry of instruction and Christian
education; the right of establishing
these institutions, providing
for their recruitment, and for their
material means of existence. All
this, it is acknowledged, constitutes
the normal condition of the church
in communities which concede a
just share of influence to the
Catholic religion, to its ministers,
and to all those who are inspired
with its spirit of devotion to the general
welfare. But observe the points
of divergence between the Catholics
of whom we are speaking and
those who are more jealous to preserve
intact the rights conferred
by Jesus Christ upon his church.
According to the former, a distinction
must be made between religious
education and literary or scientific
education. The former, by
its object and by its end, escapes
from the competence of the state
to re-enter what is exclusively the
province of the church. It is different
with literary and scientific
instruction. That, they say, is a
social service which belongs, like
other services of a similar kind, to
the jurisdiction of the city or nation.
The exercise of the teaching
ministry is undoubtedly free.
Private individuals are entitled to
devote themselves to it without let
or hindrance. But the direction
of this ministry should be ascribed
to the state, the only judge of
whatever affects the present and
the future of society. Guardian of
order, of justice, and of morals in the
community, it is the duty of government
itself to regulate the discipline
of public schools, the instruction
which is given there, the academic
titles which open the way to
certain civil or administrative careers,
and the choice of masters;
who, at any rate, should not have
incurred any of the disqualifications
determined by the law.
Moreover, since its functions impose
on it the duty of encouraging,
as much as possible, useful institutions,
and such as are essential to
public prosperity, the government
is bound to support schools founded
by private individuals; and
even, if there be not enough of
them for the needs of the people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">[731]</a></span>
to institute others by its own
authority, and out of the public
funds. This, according to them,
belongs to the domain of the state.
Here it reigns supreme, without
having to share its power with
any other power, civil or religious.
Public instruction is a branch of
administration on the same grounds
as war or finance.</p>

<p>Thus think and speak Catholics
of the modern political school.
Unluckily for them, such is not the
doctrine of the church. Pius IX.,
in the forty-fifth proposition of the
<cite>Syllabus</cite>, explicitly condemns the
opinion we have just described, and
which he formulates in the following
terms: “The whole direction
of public schools, in which the
youth of a Christian state is
brought up, with the exception, to
a certain extent, of episcopal seminaries,
can be and ought to be vested
in the civil authority, and that
in such a manner that the right of
no other authority should be recognized
to interfere with the discipline
of those schools, with the
curriculum of studies, with the
conferring of degrees, or with the
choice or approval of masters.”
This, however specious, is thus
erroneous, and no Catholic can
maintain it. It is, in fact, false in
a two-fold point of view&mdash;false in
a merely natural point of view, because
it ascribes to the state a
function which, in default of the
church, belongs exclusively to the
family; false also, and especially,
in a supernatural point of view, because
it separates what ought to be
united, the temporal consequences
of education, and its supernatural
end. We will expose this twofold
error.</p>

<p>Under the empire of a nondescript
philosophical paganism, our
modern politicians have a striking
tendency to enlarge more and more
in society the circle of governmental
privileges. One would suppose,
to listen to them, that it was
the function of power to completely
absorb all the organic elements
which go to make a nation, and to
leave no longer existing side by
side of it, or beneath it, aught but
inert individualities, social material
capable of receiving impulse and
movement only from it. Healthy
reason protests against a theory so
destructive of the most indispensable
elements of social prosperity.
Families collecting into cities forfeited
none of their natural rights;
cities, in associating themselves in
nations did not pretend to abdicate
all their powers. What both
sought, on the contrary, in association,
was a stronger guarantee of
those very rights; it was the maintenance
of the most inviolable justice
in human relations; it was, in
short, an efficient protection against
violence and oppression, whether
from within or without.</p>

<p>What! Are we to admit that the
right and the duty of educating
children sprung from society, and
was originated by it? The bare
thought is folly. From the first creation
of the family, God willed that the
infant should come into the world
in feebleness and impotence; that,
physically, intellectually, and morally,
it should have need of a long
and toilsome education before becoming
a complete man. On whom
was it, then, that he imposed a natural
obligation of undertaking and
accomplishing its education? Certainly
not on society, which did not
then exist. It was on the family itself,
on the father especially, who is
its responsible head. The power
of engendering human beings includes
of necessity the duty of not
leaving such a work incomplete&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732">[732]</a></span>
duty, consequently, of guiding
the infant up to full manhood.</p>

<p>The family thus, by virtue of a
law of nature, possesses the power of
instructing and educating the understanding
and will of the child born
of it; and this power the family
does not lose by being associated
with others in social life. For, we
repeat, the state is not instituted to
absorb into its collective life all
pre-existing rights. The act of
union merely consecrates those
rights by placing them under the
protection of public authority.
But when this authority, instead of
protecting the rights of the family,
proceeds to take possession of
them, it commits an usurpation, it
breaks the social pact, by making
itself guilty of the very crime which
it ought to prevent.</p>

<p>Nothing less than the utter and
ruinous confusion of ideas introduced
by the philosophy of the last
century, and by its absurd theories
about the Social Contract, could
have caused principles so clear and
so indisputable to be lost sight of,
and all the usurpations of the liberty
and rights of families and individuals
by the civil power to be legitimized.
But, be the errors of the
time what they may, it is not fitting
that we Catholics should be either
their accomplices or their dupes.
Enlightened by faith, our reason
must hold fast those principles on
which human society is based, and
were we to be their only defenders,
it would be to our honor to have
maintained them against all the
negations of the spirit of system.
To judge, then, only by reason, the
state has not those rights over the
education of youth which a certain
school ascribes to it.</p>

<p>We asserted, moreover, that the
opinion of this school is also false
in a supernatural point of view, because
it separates what ought to be
united, because it makes the inference
the principle, and despises the
one in order to attach itself exclusively
to the other. And here we
touch the pith of the question.</p>

<p>It is alleged, a public education
good or bad, has very serious consequences
for society. Its security
or its ruin may depend on it, and,
anyhow, nothing more vitally affects
its peace, strength, and prosperity.
The power, therefore, with which
the government of a community is
invested cannot be a matter of indifference
in education. It ought,
then, to superintend and direct it,
and to place itself at its head, as it
naturally does of every social function.
We shall presently see how
much this reasoning is worth. It
includes three things&mdash;a principle, a
fact, and an inference. The principle
is as follows: Whatever is for
society an element of strength and
progress, and can cause its prosperity
and decay, is within the competence
of the civil authority and
ought to be subject to it. The fact
is affirmed in the premises of the
argument, to wit, that public education,
according as it is good or
bad, is naturally of serious consequence
to the state. Whence the
inference, that it ought to be subject
to the civil authority&mdash;that is,
to the government.</p>

<p>The principle we dispute; the
fact is explained and vindicated in
another way, and the inference is
inconsequential.</p>

<p>First, it is not true that whatever
affects the prosperity of the state
ought of necessity to belong to the
jurisdiction of the civil power, and
to be subject to its direction and
control. Are not commerce and
manufacture elements of national
prosperity? Is it necessary, on
that account, that the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_733" id="Page_733">[733]</a></span>
should assume the direction of
them, and that nothing should be
done in those two departments of
social activity except by it. No.
In these the office of power is limited
to causing right and justice to
be respected in industrial and commercial
transactions, to intervene
in contentions to decide what is
just, to secure the observance of
positive laws enacted by it for the
purpose of applying to every particular
case the general principles
of the natural and of the divine law.
The rest is an affair of individual
enterprise among citizens. Thus, in
the question which engages us, that
the education of youth ought to
contribute much towards the prosperity
of a state is not sufficient
reason to induce us to resign the
whole of it into the hands of the
civil power. We must further inquire
if there is not some one in
the community authorized, by the
law of nature or by divine right, to
assume its direction and control.
If this be so, it will not do to invest
the state with a right which
belongs to another.</p>

<p>In the second place, the happiness
and prosperity of a state are
certainly the result of a good education
of its youth; of a complete
education, that is, well conducted;
such, in a word, as gives to the
young man all the qualities of perfect
manhood. Now, this education
is, of necessity, Christian education,
in which the state can do nothing&mdash;the
church, and the church
alone, as we have endeavored to
show, everything.</p>

<p>What, once more, is education?
We have already defined it: the
work of fitting a man to fulfil his
destiny; to place the faculties of
man in a condition of sufficing for
themselves, and of pursuing, with
the help of God, the end which is
allotted to them. Such, clearly, is
the work of education; such the
end it must of necessity propose to
itself. Suppose that in educating
a child this consideration of his
final destiny should be neglected,
that he was brought up with an eye
solely to a proximate and terrestrial
end, beyond which he could do nothing.
Could such an education
be called complete? Could it be
called sufficient? Would it deserve
even the name of education? Undoubtedly
not. That child would
not have been educated. He would
never become a man, <i lang="la">vir</i>, in the full
sense of that term, because the
vision of his intelligence would
never reach beyond the narrow
horizon of this world; because his
powers of well-doing would necessarily
be extremely limited; because,
at last, he would miss the end
which every man is bound to attain,
and would be compelled to
remain for ever nothing but an immortal
abortion.</p>

<p>Such is the necessity of recognizing
man’s final end in education.
That must be its aim, that only,
under pain of compromising all the
rest. Is there any need of mentioning
the guarantees afforded by generations
thus educated, for the
peace and happiness of communities?
Has not true and sincere
piety, in the words of the apostle,<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
promise of this life as well as of
that of eternity? Is it in any other
way than in practising the virtues
which make man a social being
that we can hope to achieve immortality?
Thus to labor to render
ourselves worthy of the destiny
which awaits us is, also, to prepare
ourselves to become good citizens of
the earthly city, is to give to society
the best possible security of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_734" id="Page_734">[734]</a></span>
useful as well as loyal to it. The
greatest men of whom humanity is
proud, were they not at the same
time the most virtuous?</p>

<p>Now, we must repeat to Catholics
who forget it, that there are not
two last ends for man, but only
one; and that is the supernatural
end of which we treated at the
commencement. Created by God
to enjoy his glory and his happiness
through eternity, in vain would
man seek elsewhere the end of his
efforts and of his existence. Everything
in him tends towards this
end. It is his perfection, and in
order to exalt himself to it, he
ought to give to his faculties the
whole power of development of
which they are capable. Woe to
him, but much more woe to those
who have had the responsibility of
his education, if, through their fault,
he does not find himself on the
level of his destiny; if, instead of
gravitating towards heaven in his
rapid passage across life, he drags
himself miserably along the ground,
wallowing in selfish interests and
sensual passions!</p>

<p>But if this be so, what can the
state do to guide souls to heights
which surpass itself? There is
nothing to be done but to apply
the principle formulated by S.
Thomas: “It is his to order means
to an end, in whose possession that
end is”&mdash;<i lang="la">Illius est ordinare ad finem,
cujus est proprius ille finis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> The
supernatural transformation of the
soul into God, and eternal beatitude,
which education ought invariably
to propose to itself, are not
the objects of human society any
more than of the civil power which
regulates it. That power is consequently
incapable, of itself, of ordaining
the means which contribute
to this supernatural end. It cannot
afford the very smallest assistance
to education in this respect,
nothing to form the man, and to
adapt him to the grand designs of
God in his behalf. In a word, education
is not within the jurisdiction
of earthly governments. It is above
their competence.</p>

<p>What, then, is the power in the
Christian communities commissioned
with the sublime ministry of
the education of souls? Who has
received from God the divine mission
of begetting them to the supernatural
and divine life, rough-drawn
on earth, perfected in heaven?
There is, there can be, but
one reply. The church! When
he founded that august spiritual
society, Jesus Christ assigned to it
as its end, to guide men to eternal
happiness; and on that account he
endowed it with all the powers necessary
to ordain and to put in
operation the proper means for this
end. Education conducted in a
spirit fundamentally Christian&mdash;such
is the universal, indispensable
mean, over which, consequently,
the church has exclusive rights.</p>

<p>See then, established by Jesus
Christ, the great instructress of the
human race&mdash;the only one which
can rightfully pretend to direct
public education in Christian communities!
That superintendence,
that direction, are an integral part of
the pastoral ministry. The church
cannot renounce it without prevarication.</p>

<p>Her reason, therefore, is obvious
for insisting, with such obstinate
persistency, in claiming, everywhere
and always, the exercise of a right
which she holds from God himself.
Obvious is the reason for which
the Sovereign Pontiffs have so severely
condemned a doctrine which
is the denial of this inalienable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_735" id="Page_735">[735]</a></span>
right for which, in the concordats
concluded with Catholic powers, a
special clause invariably reserves for
the church the faculty of “seeing
that youth receive a Christian education.”<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>Nothing is more clear than that,
when the Catholic Church, in a
Christian state, claims for itself the
ministry of public instruction, it is
no monopoly which it seeks to
grasp for the profit of its clerics.
It has but one object, to wit, that
instruction should have as wide a
scope as possible; and for this
object she appeals to all devotedness.
Laymen and ecclesiastics,
seculars and religious, all&mdash;all are
besought to take a part in this work
of instructing the peoples. Whoever
offers himself with the necessary
qualifications, a pure faith, Christian
manners, and competent knowledge,
is welcome. To such an one
the church opens a free scope for
his energies, to cultivate the rising
generations under her shelter and
in co-operation with her, in order to
enable them to bring forth the
fruits of knowledge and of virtue.
What she does not assent to, what
she cannot assent to, is that, under
the pretext of liberty of instruction,
the ravening wolf should introduce
himself into the fold, in the person
of those teachers of errors and falsehood
who lay waste the flock by
bringing into it discord and war;
that, under the guise of science and
intellectual progress, they should
sap the religious belief of a people,
assault Christian truth, and infect
the young understanding with the
deadly poison of doubt and unbelief.
No, indeed! Such havoc the
church can neither sanction nor
allow them an opportunity to accomplish.
She remembers that she
has received from Christ the care
of souls, that the salvation of his
children has been entrusted to her
keeping, and that God will demand
of her an account of their blood
shed&mdash;that is to say, of their eternal
perdition. <i lang="la">Sanguinem ejus de manu
tua requiram</i> (Ezech. iii. 18). As
a watchful sentinel she keeps guard
over the flock, and so long as the
criminal violence of human powers
does not rob her of her rights,
neither the thieves nor the assassins
of souls can succeed in exercising
their ravages.</p>

<p>By way of recapitulation we will
enunciate, in five or six propositions,
the whole of this doctrine of the
rights of the church over education,
and thus place the reader in
a better position for judging of its
full force and extent.</p>

<p>1st. The education of clerics destined
to ecclesiastical functions is
the exclusive right of the church.
She alone regulates everything
connected with it, whether the
erection of seminaries, or their interior
discipline, or the appointment
of masters, or the instruction
in letters and science, or the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_736" id="Page_736">[736]</a></span>
education of the pupils, or their admission
into the ecclesiastical body.</p>

<p>2d. The church implicitly respects
the right of families to provide
a private education for their
children by whomsoever and in
whatever manner they prefer. Only
she imposes on the consciences of
Christian parents the obligation of
seeing to it that that education be
religious and in conformity with
the faith they profess.</p>

<p>3d. The superintendence and direction
of the public schools, as
well of those wherein the mass of
the people are instructed in the
rudiments of human knowledge, as
of those where secondary and higher
instruction are given, belong
of right to the Catholic Church.
She alone has the right of watching
over the moral character of
those schools, of approving the
masters who instruct the youth
therein, of controlling their teaching,
and dismissing, without appeal
to any other authority, those whose
doctrine or manners should be
contrary to the purity of Christian
doctrine.</p>

<p>4th. Subject to the condition of
being able to guarantee pure faith,
irreproachable manners, and competent
knowledge, entire liberty is
left to private individuals, ecclesiastics
and laity, seculars and religious,
to devote themselves to the
ministry of teaching and education
of youth, to form associations for
this object, to found academies and
universities wherein the sciences
are taught, and which govern themselves
by their internal discipline,
the choice of masters, and the regulation
of the studies, programmes,
examens, etc. The church only
reserves to herself, in their case,
her right of superintendence in the
matters of morality and the integrity
of the faith.</p>

<p>5th. The church not only does
not refuse the co-operation of the
state in education, but, on the contrary,
she solicits it, whenever private
enterprise and her own resources
do not suffice to enable her
to extend instruction as much as
she would wish and as the welfare
of peoples demands. She then appeals
to the communes, to the provinces,
to the nation, in order that
everywhere the co-operation of the
two powers may effect the foundation
of schools, the increase of the
number of masters, and may come
to the aid of the indigent parents.
But even in these schools established
with the concurrence of the
civil power, if the state may superintend
the administration of material
interests, the right of direction and
superintendence of teaching remains
with the church.</p>

<p>6th. Lastly, the power, nevertheless,
which the church exercises
over public instruction does not
hinder governments, if they deem it
expedient, from establishing schools
where professors chosen by them
may give a special training to young
people who devote themselves to
administrative and military careers.
The administration and the army
belong, in fact, exclusively to the
jurisdiction of governments. It
is but just, therefore, that they
should be able to give to those who
are to belong to them the especial
knowledge required for their employment.
Only, here, the civil
or military authority contracts the
same obligations as those which
bind the consciences of individuals,
to wit, to watch that there be
nothing in those schools contrary
to religion and to good morals.</p>

<p>Such is the whole doctrine of
the Catholic Church with regard to
the education of youth in Christian
states. Is there not in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_737" id="Page_737">[737]</a></span>
organization an ideal which one
may justly long to see realized,
since it would be the solution of
a certain number of problems
which strangely perplex our insecurely
founded and badly balanced
modern communities? Two authorities,
each having a distinct object,
but united and being mutually
the complement one of the
other, have the guardianship of
human interests&mdash;interests of time
and interests of eternity. One,
the civil authority, has for its direct
domain, temporal affairs. The
other, the religious authority, commands
and directs in all that concerns
the supernatural life. The
latter, having the responsibility of
guiding man from his birth up to
his entrance into eternity, educates
him, instructs him, and transforms
him into a perfect man, into a
Christian worthy by his virtues
of the destiny which awaits him.
The former benefits generations
thus formed, and out of these elements,
so well prepared to fulfil all
the duties of the present life, it
constitutes social communities as so
many provisional countries, where
justice and charity, loyally practised,
present an image of the true
and final country&mdash;Heaven. Thus,
the two powers lend to one another
a mutual support; the civil
power, by securing to the spiritual
power a complete liberty of action;
and the spiritual power, in its turn,
by forming for the state honest and
perfect citizens. Thus peace and
concord reign throughout the entire
society, interests harmonize,
justice is loved, order exists everywhere
from the highest to the lowest
step of the social ladder, and
every one, content with his position
here on earth, because his hopes
are on high, is more intent on making
himself better than on overthrowing
existing institutions that
he may raise himself on their ruins.</p>

<p>Where is to be found, once more
we demand, an ideal more grand
and more true than this conception
of Christian society? The middle
ages were not far from realizing it.
Unhappily, a work so well begun
at the inspiration of the church,
first legists, courtiers of the civil
power, afterwards Protestantism and
its direct off-shoot, rationalism, were
fain to interrupt it, and gradually
to throw us back into a state of
things which threatens to become
worse than paganism or barbarism.
There is yet time to return to truth,
to right and order, which are impossible
to be found except in a
society based on Christian principles.
But will peoples and legislators
have a sufficiently clear perception
of their duty and their interest
to stay themselves at once on
the incline down which they are
gliding, and dragging us with them,
towards a dark and tempest-threatening
future?</p>

<h4>IV.&mdash;CONDUCT OF THE CHURCH IN NON-CHRISTIAN
COMMUNITIES.</h4>

<p>In the eyes of the Catholic
Church, Christianity is the divine
afflatus, breathing upon human society
to give it a soul and infuse
life. Without her there can be in it
no true nor prolific life, and every
social organization which is not inspired
by Christianity is, of necessity,
defective and abnormal. The
church cannot regard such an organization
as a benefit, much less as
a progress beyond Christian communities.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
She deplores it, on the
contrary, and she endeavors to persuade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">[738]</a></span>
people that it would be better
for them to submit absolutely to
religion, and to take it as the guide
and regulator of their social interests.
Never has the church concealed
her desire, not to lord it
over, but to direct communities, to
penetrate them with her spirit, to
recover the salutary influence over
them which is their due, and which
they cannot reject without serious
injury. The church has never
made any mystery of this ambition.
Her enemies themselves are witnesses
to it, even when they permit
themselves, as they too often
do, to travesty and calumniate her
motives in order to render them
odious.</p>

<p>Lamentable, however, as may appear
to her to be the inferior position
which is allotted to her in
modern communities, she does not
abandon herself to useless regrets.
Without renouncing her inalienable
rights, she sets out from a fact
which it is not in her power to
change, and exhausts her ingenuity
in making the best she can of it for
the good of souls. The little liberty
and influence left to her, she
employs to fulfil her ministry; her
zeal is inventive to supply by redoubled
vigilance the want of her
ordinary means in the spiritual
government. Must not the work
of God be accomplished on earth,
in spite of the difficulties, in spite
of the impediments of all kinds devised
by hell?</p>

<p>Such, then, is the principle which
regulates the conduct of the church
in states where her authority is disowned.
To take into consideration
circumstances, established facts;
to do nothing brusquely, but using
whatever power still remains to her,
to exert every effort to ameliorate
the situation, to make herself more
useful to the faithful and to society.
Let us see how she applies this rule
to education in non-Christian communities.</p>

<p>We find first the communities
wherein the constitution proclaims
the liberty of all worships, and their
equality before the law. Here, the
Catholic Church has ceased to be
the religion of the state, which no
longer lives in her spirit, no longer
accepts her direction in matters of
religion and morality, but prefers
independence to all the advantages
of a union with which it thinks it
can dispense. How will the church
act in this novel position? In the
name of liberty, and of the equal
protection accorded to every worship,
she demands, first of all, the
right of recruiting her ministers,
and that of training them according
to her own laws; the establishment
of large and small seminaries,
as well as their administration by
the bishops exclusively. This is
the first need to satisfy. It is her
right, included in her claim to existence.</p>

<p>She demands, moreover, that in
the public schools created or authorized
by the government, religion
be invariably the foundation
of education; that the pupils be instructed
in the verities of the faith,
and that neither atheism nor religious
indifferentism be taught there.
She demands that at least the primary
schools remain denominational&mdash;that
is to say, specially appropriated
to the children of every religion,
and that the Catholic clergy
have free admission to the schools
for Catholics. The preservation
of the faith in those young hearts
is at stake here; for the church
knows by experience the doleful
effects of an early education in
which religion has not had the principal
part. Thus she may, with
good right, claim of a government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_739" id="Page_739">[739]</a></span>
Christian in name, that it leave to
the religions protected by the law
this legitimate amount of influence
in the education of the people.
From the same motives, the church
positively rejects the system of
non-denominational schools, in
which eventuates a jumble of religions
fatal to the faith and piety
of children. Assuredly Catholics
know how to recognize and respect
the rights of dissenters, nor do they
dream of doing violence to the conscience
of any one. Is it not, then,
simply common justice that no advantage
should be taken of the liberty
and equality of the several religions
before the law, to hand
over Catholic children to a manifest
danger of religious perversion
and moral ruin?</p>

<p>But this is not all. The principles
on which the communities of which
we speak rest, permit Catholics to
require more. True liberty for a
religion consists in its being able
to be not only practised by its adherents,
but also transmitted in its
integrity to succeeding generations,
with its beliefs, its precepts, its exterior
forms, and, above all, its interior
spirit. Now, that is only
possible by means of education.
It is, then, permitted to the church
to demand that liberty be left to
families to choose themselves masters
worthy of their confidence,
and whom they can trust to instruct
and educate their children in the
principles of the Catholic religion.
When the national constitution has
already embodied the liberty of instruction
in every stage, Catholics
make as extensive use of it as they
can, and as their peculiar property,
imitating in that the shipwrecked
man who collects together the waifs
saved from the wreck, and out of
them tries to rebuild his shattered
fortune. If, on the contrary, the
monopoly in favor of the state
should be embodied in the law, they
arm themselves with maxims of
natural right, at times even with
the commonly accepted ideas of
liberty, wherewith to beat down
this scandalous monopoly. They
know how to set in motion all legal
means; and without having recourse,
like many of their adversaries,
to insurrection or corruption,
they succeed, sooner or later, in
bringing over public opinion to the
side of justice and truth, and in recovering,
thus, a portion of the
rights which belong to their church,
the right of making instructed and
conscientious Christians. After
that, the church can await from the
divine benediction and her own efforts
the return of a happier era,
for which she exerts all the means
at her disposal, by a solid Christian
education given to youth, by
preaching, and by good example.
She will, at least, have neglected
nothing to acquit herself of her
mission, and to make herself useful
even to the communities which
repudiate her.</p>

<p>There remains, lastly, the third
hypothesis, that of a state separated
from the church&mdash;that is to say,
organized wholly out of the religious
idea, a “lay state,” in the full
force of that phrase.</p>

<p>We observe, first, that there is more
than one degree in this secularization
of the state. The first
realizes the rationalist idea, according
to which governments, respectful
towards religion, and allowing
absolute liberty, leave the church
to organize herself after her fashion,
to preach in her temples, to
teach in her schools, and to govern
the consciences subject to her authority,
whilst themselves govern
according to the right of rationalism,
and without asking counsel of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_740" id="Page_740">[740]</a></span>
any religious power. It is the
dream of more than one liberal,
simple enough to believe a perfect
equilibrium of human passions to
be possible in society, by the sole
force of nature and reason. But
experience soon dissipates the illusion
of so fair a dream. All the
degrees of separation between religion
and society are soon traversed
up to the last, wherein the state,
no longer acknowledging creed,
church, or religion, announces itself
atheist, and forces consciences
to the inflexible level of an impious
legislation. From thence there is
but a step to the proscription of
Catholics, and to open persecution.</p>

<p>However, in the conditions of an
existence so unpromising what is
the conduct of Catholics? What
can they do save invoke the common
right, and turn against their
adversaries the weapons by which
the latter dispossessed them? The
lay state proclaims liberty for all to
speak, write, and teach, as seems
good to them. It is in the name
of this pretended principle that the
church saw herself robbed of almost
all her rights and driven from society.
Do not imagine that she
approves or that she will ever
adopt so monstrous an error. But
this liberty of speaking, writing, and
teaching which you do not refuse to
error, is it forbidden to claim it for
truth? Truth! It is herself; and
her right to speak to the world she
holds, not from false maxims inscribed
in modern constitutions, but
from Jesus Christ, her divine founder.
Strong in this right, superior
to human constitutions, the church
never hesitates to assume in communities
the whole space they leave
her to occupy, and to extend her
action to the uttermost. If they
claim to exclude her, she fashions a
weapon out of common right. She
summons the governments to admit
her to the benefit of the universal
liberty inscribed in the law, and
too profusely lavished on teachers
of error. What exception can be
taken to this conduct, at once so
loyal and so right?</p>

<p>But they charge it against us as
an unworthy manœuvre, that we
claim for ourselves, in modern communities,
and in the name of their
principles, a liberty we shall refuse
to our adversaries the moment we
regain power. In presence of this
accusation, the more exalted liberals
demand that preventive reprisals
be employed in our regard, and
that liberty be denied us. The
more moderate, affecting a sort of
confidence in the stability of their
work&mdash;or rather, in the impossibility
of modern communities ever again
returning to the yoke of religion&mdash;prefer
to show themselves generous,
and to vote for liberty even although
it be that of Catholics.
Touching self-sacrifice, and which
it must be owned is no longer in
unison with the temperament of
contemporary liberalism!</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the accusation
is sheer calumny, as facts prove.
Neither in the small Swiss cantons,
nor in Belgium, where Catholics
govern, are dissenters oppressed.
If persecution rages anywhere in
the two hemispheres, it is where
liberalism has planted its banner,
and against Catholics. It is something
more than ignorance which
can accuse us of persecuting tendencies
at this time of day. The
truth is that social peace has no
firmer supporters than Catholics.</p>

<p>We have before asserted, but it
is well to repeat it, that the Catholic
Church professes and practises
the most absolute respect for acquired
rights, for conventions concluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_741" id="Page_741">[741]</a></span>
and accepted. Thus, for
the sake of peace, certain governments
have felt themselves obliged
to recognize the right of dissenters
to live in the state, retaining their
beliefs and their religious forms.
Liberty of conscience has been proclaimed,
the public exercise of all
the worships authorized. It is,
doubtless, a misfortune that religious
unity in society should be
broken. The church regrets this
misfortune, and her most earnest
desire is to see, some day, unity re-established.
But is that to say that
she wishes violently to change a
situation imposed on her by circumstances?
that she meditates seizing
again, at a blow, and in contempt of
acquired rights, the power she enjoyed
in better times? By no
means. The liberty which the various
sects enjoy, for the sake of
peace, the Catholic Church respects
and knows how to maintain. Dissenters
may continue to practise
publicly their religion, provided
that they trouble neither order nor
the tranquillity of the state. Equality
of civil and political rights is
guaranteed to all citizens, Catholic
or not. The same liberty is conceded
to them to open schools, and
to educate their children according
to their beliefs. Nothing, in short,
which is just and equitable among
fellow-citizens is refused by Catholics
to those who do not share their
faith. What more do they want?
And what is lacking in this conduct
to constitute true toleration in mixed
communities?</p>

<p>Of Catholics who have become
the depositaries of power in these
communities the church demands
complete liberty to fulfil the duties
with which she has been charged
by Jesus Christ&mdash;the right of organizing
herself according to her own
laws; of recruiting the sacerdotal
ministry and exercising all its
functions; of watching over the
good education of Catholic youth;
of founding and directing schools,
colleges, and universities; of having
her religious congregations consecrated
to prayer, preaching, or education;
of being able, in short, to
exercise her salutary influence in
society, and of being free to devote
herself to rendering the people
better, better instructed in their
duties, and more resolute to fulfil
them. As regards non-Catholics,
she demands of the government not
to substitute license for liberty, but
to use its utmost efforts to banish
from society two things which are
the most hostile to its prosperity
and to its happiness: we mean immorality
and irreligion. If, later on,
differences disappear, if all hearts
should unite in the profession of
one same faith, it will then be a
source of regret to no one that the
church resumes her rank, and that
society is once more Christian and
Catholic.</p>

<h3>ARE YOU MY WIFE?</h3>

<p class="center">BY THE AUTHOR OF “PARIS BEFORE THE WAR,” “NUMBER THIRTEEN,” “PIUS VI.,” ETC.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">A STARTLING DISCLOSURE.</span></h4>

<p>And how had things fared at
The Lilies all this time? Sir Simon
had behaved in the strangest
way. Immediately after Clide’s
departure, he came, according to
his promise, and explained it after
a plausible fashion to M. de la
Bourbonais, who, unsuspecting as
an infant, accepted the story without
surprise or question.</p>

<p>At the end of a week Sir Simon
knew that the worst fears were confirmed;
the identity of the supposed
Isabel had been disproved, and
the existence of the real one ascertained
beyond the possibility of
doubt. Clide was on her track, but
when or how he should find her
was yet the secret of the future.</p>

<p>The one thing clear in it was, that
it was a miserable business and could
end in nothing but shame and sorrow
for every one connected with it.
Sir Simon was helpless and bewildered.
He was always slow at taking
in bad news, and when he succeeded
in doing it, his first idea
was, not to take the bull by the
horns and face the facts manfully,
but to stave off the evil day, to gain
time, to trust to something turning
up that would avert the inevitable.
He had never in the whole course
of his life felt so helpless in the face
of evil tidings as on the present
occasion. He foresaw, all too
plainly, what the effect was likely
to be on the innocent young creature
on whom he had brought so
terrible a share in the catastrophe.
It was no comfort to him that it
was not his fault. He would willingly
have taken the fault on his
own shoulders, if thereby he could
have lifted the pain from hers. He
was too generously absorbed in
the thought of Franceline’s trouble
to split hairs on the difference
between remorse and regret; he
cursed his own meddling as bitterly
as if he had acted like a deliberate
villain towards her; he felt there
was nothing for him to do but blow
his brains out. He passed the day
he received the admiral’s letter in
this suicidal and despairing state
of mind. The next day his indignation
against himself found some
solace in vituperating Clide’s ill-luck,
and the villainy of the woman
who had led him such a devil’s-dance.
This diversion soothed
him; he slept better that night,
and next morning he awoke refreshed;
cheered up according to his
happy matutinal habit, and took a
brighter view of everything. It remained
no doubt a most unfortunate
affair, look at it as one might,
but Franceline would get over it by
and by. Why not? All the nicest
girls he knew when he was a young
fellow had been crossed in love,
and they had all got over it, and
married somebody else and lived
happily ever after. Why should
not Franceline do the same? De
Winton was a very nice fellow, but
there were other nice fellows in the
world. There was Roxham, for instance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743">[743]</a></span>
If he, Sir Simon, was a
pretty girl, he was not sure but he
should like Roxham best of the
two; he was deuced good-looking,
and the eldest son of a peer to
boot; that counts with every girl,
why shouldn’t it with Franceline?
“But is she like every girl? Is
she a butterfly to be caught by any
candle?” whispered somebody at
Sir Simon’s ear; but he pooh-poohed
the unwelcome busybody, as he
would have brushed away a buzzing
fly. She must get over it; Roxham
should come in and cut out this unlucky
Clide. The worst of it was
that conversation Sir Simon had had
with Raymond before Franceline’s
visit to London. If he had but had
the wit to hold his tongue a little
longer! Well, biting it off now
would not mend matters. Roxham
must come to the rescue. He had
evidently been smitten the night of
the ball. Sir Simon had intentionally
brought him into the field to
rouse Clide’s jealousy, and bring
him to the point; he had invoked
every species of anathema on himself
for it ever since, but it was going
to turn out the luckiest inspiration
after all. While the baronet
was performing his toilet, he arranged
matters thus satisfactorily
to his own mind, and by the time
he came down to breakfast he was
fully convinced that everything was
going to be for the best. He read
his letters, wished a few unpleasant
little eventualities to the writers of
most of them, and crammed them
into a drawer where they were not
likely to be disturbed for some
time to come. The others he answered;
then he read the newspapers,
and that done, ordered his
horse round, and rode to Rydal,
Lady Anwyll’s place.</p>

<p>The conversation naturally fell
on the recent ball at the Court, and
from that to the acknowledged
belle of the evening, Mlle. de la
Bourbonais. In answer to the
plump little dowager’s enthusiastic
praises of his young friend’s beauty
the baronet remarked that it was a
pity she did not live nearer The
Lilies. “It is dull for the little
thing, you see,” he said; “Bourbonais
is up to his eyes in books and
study, and she has no society to
speak of within reach; she and the
Langrove girls don’t seem to take
to each other much; she is a peculiar
child, Franceline; you see she has
never mixed with children, she has
been like a companion to her father,
and the result is that she has fallen
into a dreamy kind of world of her
own, and that’s not good for a girl;
she is apt to prey upon herself. I
wish you were a nearer neighbor of
ours.”</p>

<p>“I am near enough for all intents
and purposes,” said Lady Anwyll,
promptly; “what is it but an hour’s
drive? There’s nothing I should
like better than to take her about,
pretty creature, with her great
gazelle eyes; but I dare say she
would bore herself with me; they
don’t care for old women’s society,
those young things&mdash;why should
they? I hated an old woman like a
sour apple when I was her age.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but Franceline is not a bit
like most girls of her age; she
would enjoy you very much, I assure
you she would,” protested Sir
Simon warmly. “There is nothing
she likes better than talking to me
now, and I might be your father,”
he added, with more gallantry than
truth; but Lady Anwyll laughed a
contemptuous, little, good-humored
laugh without contradicting him.
“She has seen very little and read
a great deal&mdash;too much in fact; you
would be surprised to see how
much she has read about all sorts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_744" id="Page_744">[744]</a></span>
of things that most girls only know
by name; her father was for teaching
her Greek and Latin, but I
bullied him out of that nonsense;
it would have been a downright
crime to spoil such a creature by
making her blue. I’ve saved her
from that, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“I dare say that is not the only
good service she owes you,” observed
the dowager, “nor is it likely
to be the last. When is your
young relation coming back?”</p>

<p>“De Winton, you mean? He’s
hardly a relation&mdash;a connection at
most. I don’t know when he is
likely to turn up; I believe he’s on
his way to the North Pole at present.”</p>

<p>“Really! I thought there was a
magnet drawing him nearer home.”</p>

<p>“What! Franceline, eh? Well,
I thought myself he was a trifle
spooney in that quarter,” said the
baronet, bending down to examine
his boots, “but it would seem not,
or he would not have decamped;
he’s an odd fish, Clide&mdash;a capital
fellow, but odd.”</p>

<p>“I thought him original, and
liked him very much, what little I
saw of him,” replied Lady Anwyll.
“However, I am glad to hear it is
not a case between him and your
pretty friend; if there is a thing I
<em>hate</em>”&mdash;with ten drops of vitriol in
the monosyllable&mdash;“it’s chaperoning
a girl in love. You have no
satisfaction in her; nothing interests
or amuses her; she is ready to
bite the nose off any man that
looks civil at her; she is a social
nuisance in fact, and I make a point
of having nothing to do with her.”</p>

<p>Sir Simon threw back his head
and laughed.</p>

<p>“How about young Charlton?”
resumed the dowager; “he is the
match of the county. Has he gone
in for the prize?”</p>

<p>“He’s too great an ass,” was the
rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Humph! Asses are proof, then,
against the power of a beautiful
face? It’s the first time I’ve heard
it.”</p>

<p>“The fact is, I don’t think he
has had a chance yet,” said Sir Simon;
“Bourbonais is peculiar, and
does not encourage people to go
and see him; he only admits a select
circle of old fogies, and I
think he fancies Charlton is a bit
of a puppy.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’s not much out in
that,” assented the lady.</p>

<p>“Roxham struck me as being
rather smitten the other night;
did you notice anything in that direction,”
inquired Sir Simon carelessly,
as he rose to go. “I was too
busy to see much of what was going
on in the way of flirtation, but
I fancied he was rather assiduous!”</p>

<p>“Now, that would be a very nice
thing!” And the mother who had
made many matches brightened up
with lively interest. “I should like
to help on that; it would be quite
an exciting amusement, and I have
nothing to do just now.”</p>

<p>“Take care!” and Sir Simon
raised his finger with a warning
gesture; “you may have a social
nuisance on your hands before you
know where you are.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t mind when it’s of
my own making,” said the dowager;
“that quite alters the case.”</p>

<p>“Then you will drive over to-morrow
or next day and call at
The Lilies?”</p>

<p>Sir Simon mounted Nero in high
good humor; whistled a hunting
air as he dashed through the stiff
Wellingtonias that flanked the long
avenue at Rydal, and never drew
rein until he alighted at his own
door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745">[745]</a></span></p>

<p>M. de la Bourbonais greeted
Lady Anwyll with the innate courtesy
of a grand seignior, and never
let her see by so much as a look
that her visit was not an agreeable
surprise. Yet it was not so. Since
that conversation with Sir Simon
about Franceline’s fortune, an uneasy
feeling had possessed him, and
he had shrunk back more sensitively
than ever into his shell of reserve
and isolation. He had been content,
or rather compelled, to leave
matters entirely in Sir Simon’s
hands, or in the hands of fate, but
he did not feel at rest, and he had
no mind to launch out into new acquaintances
just at a moment when
his mind was disturbed by strange
probabilities, and his habitual abstraction
broken up by vague anxieties,
that could not take any definite
shape as yet. But Lady Anwyll
saw nothing of this in the old
gentleman’s courtly greeting; she
saw that Franceline had welcomed
her with a warmth that was unmistakable&mdash;childlike
and gleeful, and
fettered by no ice bands of conventional
politeness.</p>

<p>The dowager’s visit was indeed
welcome; the utter silence that had
succeeded to the stir and agitation
of the past few weeks had fallen
upon Franceline like a snow-drift
in the midst of summer; the return
to the old stagnant life was dreadful&mdash;she
felt chilled to death by it.
The reaction was natural enough
to one of her age and circumstances;
but we know that there was a
deeper reason for her sense of loneliness
and weariness than the mere
relapse into routine and dulness
after a season of excitement. Where
was Mr. de Winton, and why had he
gone off in that strange way, without
a sign or a word, leaving her trembling
and expectant on the threshold
of her awakened womanhood?</p>

<p>It was more than a week now
since he went, and she had not
heard his name once mentioned,
and there was no prospect of her
hearing any one speak of him; since
neither her father nor Sir Simon
did so. Lady Anwyll came like a
messenger and a link; Lady Anwyll
was in Clide’s world, the wide,
wide world beyond her own small
sphere where no one knew him.
This was unconsciously the reason
of Franceline’s joyous greeting.
Sir Simon had come with the dowager;
they had walked down through
the park together, and it was the
first time in her life that Franceline
was not thoroughly glad to see him.
He was not quite like his usual self
either, to her, she fancied. He
rattled on in his own way, telling
stories and making jokes, and then
catching up some chance words of
Raymond’s and quarrelling with
them, until their author waxed
warm, and was drawn out into an
elaborate refutation of some meaning
that he never dreamed of giving
them, but into which Sir Simon
had purposely twisted them; and
finally accomplishing his aim of
keeping the conversation on abstract
subjects and not letting it
slip into the dangerous path of personal
or local events.</p>

<p>“So you will let me come and
take you out for a drive sometimes,”
Lady Anwyll said, as she rose to
take leave, “and by-and-by, when
you get used to the old woman,
perhaps you will come and spend a
day or two with her in her big,
lonely house? You will not be always
afraid of her?”</p>

<p>“I am not afraid of her now,”
protested Franceline, looking with
her radiant dark eyes straight into
the old lady’s face, “you don’t look
wicked at all.”</p>

<p>“Don’t I? Then more shame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746">[746]</a></span>
for me; that shows I’m a hypocrite,
a whitened sepulchre, my
dear,” and she nodded emphatically
at Franceline, and gave a little
groan.</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake don’t come
Miss Bulpit over us!” cried Sir Simon,
holding up his hands. “I’ll
bolt at once if you take to that.”
And with this pretence of alarm he
hurried out of the room.</p>

<p>“Then, since you are not frightened
at me, you will promise to
come very soon. Let us settle it
at once&mdash;for Thursday next?” and
she held the young girl’s hand in
both her own, and looked to M. de
la Bourbonais for assent.</p>

<p>But Raymond began to settle his
spectacles, and was for explaining
how difficult it would be for him to
part with his daughter even for a
day, and how unaccustomed she
was to going anywhere alone, when
Sir Simon called out from the garden:</p>

<p>“Tut, tut, Bourbonais, that’s precisely
why she must go; you must
not mope the child in this way;
she must gad about a bit, like other
girls. It will do her good; it will
do her good.”</p>

<p>The three came out and joined
him, walking round to the back entrance
through which the visitors
were going to re-enter the park.</p>

<p>“I shall get a few young people
together, so it will not be so very
dull for you, my dear,” continued
Lady Anwyll, as they walked four
abreast on the grass; “and I can
mount you; I know you ride.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t think she would
care&mdash;” began Raymond; but Sir
Simon cut him short again.</p>

<p>“Is your son coming down for a
shot at the partridges?”</p>

<p>“Not he; at least not that I
know of; he is off fishing near
Norway, or was the last time I
heard of him; but for all I know
he may have joined your friend
young De Winton at the North
Pole by this. Well, good-by, my
dear. I should dearly like a kiss.
Would you mind kissing the old
woman?”</p>

<p>Franceline put her soft, vermilion
lips to the wrinkled cheek.
Neither Lady Anwyll nor Raymond
saw how instantaneously the
blood had forsaken them, leaving
them white as her brow; but Sir
Simon did, and it smote him to the
heart. He walked on before the
good-bys were over, ostensibly to
give some order about the carriage
that was drawn up at a turn in the
avenue, but in reality to avoid
meeting Raymond’s glance.</p>

<p>Late that evening a note came
to The Lilies to say that he was
obliged to start at a moment’s notice
for the south of France, where
his step-mother, Lady Rebecca, was
dangerously ill. He was sorry to
have to rush off without saying
good-by, but he had not a moment
to lose to catch the express.</p>

<p>Sir Simon did start by the express,
and after a day or two in
London, where he saw Admiral de
Winton, and ascertained that nothing
new had turned up in Clide’s
affairs, he thought he might just as
well go to the south of France,
where he would be within reach of
his interesting relative in case she
should need him, or die, which the
older she grew the less she seemed
inclined to do, in spite of Mr.
Simpson’s periodical tolling of her
death-knell. Fate, that abstract
divinity invoked by pagans and
novelists, interfered with the fulfilment
of Franceline’s engagement
to Lady Anwyll. A letter&mdash;a real
letter&mdash;awaited her at home from
her son-in-law, saying that his wife
was taken suddenly ill, and entreated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_747" id="Page_747">[747]</a></span>
her mother to come to her without
delay. Franceline was rather
glad than sorry when the note
came to postpone her visit. The
desire to go to Rydal was gone.
She wanted to be left alone. She
was not equal to the effort of seeming
amused. And yet, again, in another
way she regretted it. A day
or two’s absence from her father
would have been a relief; the
strain of keeping up false appearances
before him was worse than it
need have been amongst strangers;
it would have sufficed them to be
calm; at home she must be gay.
After the sudden shock which
those words so carelessly uttered
by Lady Anwyll had caused her,
Franceline’s first thought was to
screen her feelings from her father.
She was helped in her effort to do
this by her certainty that he had
no key to them, that he had not
for a moment connected her and
Clide de Winton in his thoughts.
If she had known how much had
been disclosed to him, how closely
he had watched her ever since that
fatal conversation with Sir Simon,
concealment would have been impossible.
As it was, she found it
hard enough; but there was an unsuspected
strength of will, a vitality
of power in her, that enabled her
to act the part she had resolved
upon. She called up all her love
for her father and all her native
woman’s pride and maiden delicacy
to the effort, and she achieved
it. Her father watched her with
the jealous eye of anxious affection,
but he could see nothing
forced in her spirits; he heard no
hollow note in her laugh; he saw
no trace of sadness in her smile.
She was merrier, brighter, more
talkative for several days after
Lady Anwyll’s visit than he remembered
to have seen her. Raymond
sighed with relief many times
a day as he heard her singing to
herself, or caressing her doves with
new names of endearment and fresh
delight. She succeeded perfectly
in blinding him, but not in silencing
the wild tumult of her own
heart. It was all mystery yet; pain
and wonder were predominant, but
hope was not absent from the
chaos of conflicting emotions, and
there was nothing of wounded self-respect,
no definite feeling of reproach
towards Clide. It seemed
as if everything were a mistake;
no one had done anything wrong,
and yet everything had gone wrong.
Was it all a dream the life she had
been living for those few blissful
weeks? Was his devotion to her,
his exclusive assiduity during all
that time, nothing but the customary
demeanor of a gentleman to a
young girl in whose society chance
had thrown him? Franceline asked
herself this over and over again,
and could only find one answer to
it&mdash;the echo of her own heart. But
what did she really know about
such things&mdash;what standard had
she to go by? What had she ever
seen to guide her in forming a reasonable
conclusion?&mdash;for she wanted
to be reasonable: to judge
calmly without listening to the
longings and tyrannical affirmations
of this heart. “He may
have been so assiduous in attending
me in my rides simply to please
Sir Simon,” whispered reason; but
the response came quickly: “Need
he have looked and spoken as he
did to please Sir Simon? And
that night of the ball, was it to
please Sir Simon that he was stung
and angry when I deserted him for
Lord Roxham? Was it for that
that he spoke those words that
had set my every fibre thrilling?
‘What does anything matter to us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_748" id="Page_748">[748]</a></span>
Franceline, as long as we are not
angry with each other?’ To what
melting tenderness was his voice
toned as he uttered them! How
his glance sought mine and rested
in it, completing all that the words
had left unsaid! And I am to believe
that he had meant no more
than the customary gallantries of a
man of the world to his partner in
the dance?” She laughed to herself
as the outrageous question rose in
her thoughts. Then, apart from
this unanswerable testimony, there
was evidence of Clide’s feelings
and motives towards herself in his
conduct towards her father. How
anxious he had shown himself to
please M. de la Bourbonais, to secure
his advice and follow it, and
make her aware that he did so!
No; she had not assuredly been
won unsought. This certainty supported
and cheered her. If she
had been sought, she would be
sought again. Clide would return
and claim what he had won. It
was impossible to doubt but that
he would. Whenever Franceline
arrived at this point in her cogitations
her spirits rose to singing
pitch, and she would break out into
carol and song, like a bird, and run
down to Angélique and tease her
to exasperation, pulling out her
knitting-needles and playing tricks
like a kitten, till she drove her nearly
frantic, and sent her complaining
to M. le Comte that <i lang="fr">la petite</i> was
grown as full of mischief as a squirrel;
there was no being safe a minute
from her tricks once your back
was turned. And Raymond would
look up with a beaming face, and
beg pardon for the culprit. “She
keeps life in our old veins, ma
bonne,” he would say; “what should
we do without our singing bird?”</p>

<p>But there were days when the
singing bird was silent, when there
was no music in her, and when she
could have broken into passionate
tears if they had not been restrained
by a strong effort of will. These
alternations, however, passed unobserved
by the two who might
have noticed them. Raymond had
made up his mind that Sir Simon’s
brilliant scheme had failed, and
that as the failure had dealt no
blow at Franceline’s happiness, it
was not to be regretted. It had
been altogether too brilliant to be
practicable; he felt that from the
first, and his instinct served him
better than Sir Simon’s experience,
shrewd man of the world though he
was. “Kind, foolish friend, his
affection blinded him and made him
see everything as he desired it for
Franceline, and now he is vexed
with himself, and ashamed very
likely, and so he keeps away from
me. Perhaps he imagines I would
reproach him. This poor, dear
Simon has more heart than head.”</p>

<p>And with these indulgent reflections,
Raymond sank back into his
dreamy historical world, and left
off watching the changeful aspects
of his child. She was safe; things
were just as they used to be.</p>

<p>A month went by; during that
time one letter had come from the
baronet, affectionate as ever, but
evidently written under some feeling
of restraint. He talked of the
annoyances he had had on the
road, and the loss of some of his
luggage, and about French politics.
M. de le Bourbonais fancied
he saw through the awkwardness;
he answered the letter in a
more than usually affectionate
strain; was very communicative
about himself and Franceline, who
was growing quite beyond Angélique’s
and his control, he assured
his friend, and required Sir Simon’s
hand to keep her within bounds, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_749" id="Page_749">[749]</a></span>
he had better hasten home as quickly
as possible if he had any pity for
the two victims of her tyranny and
numberless caprices. This letter
had the effect intended; it brought
another without many days’ delay,
and written with all the <em>abandon</em>
and spirit of the writer’s most
cheerful mood.</p>

<p>Lady Anwyll returned at the end
of the month, and bore down on
The Lilies the very next day.
Franceline would have fought off
if she could have done so with any
chance of success; but the dowager
was peremptory in claiming what
had been distinctly promised, and
she agreed to be ready the next day
to accompany the old lady to
Rydal.</p>

<p>Angélique put her biggest irons
in the fire, and smoothed out her
young mistress’s prettiest white
muslin dress, and set her sashes
and ribbons in order, and was as
full of bustle as if the quiet visit a
few miles off had been a wedding.</p>

<p>“I am glad the <i lang="fr">petite</i> is going; it
will do her good,” she observed,
complacently, as she brought in
the lamp and set it down on the
count’s table that evening.</p>

<p>“Why do you think it will do
her good? Is she suffering in any
way?” said the father, a sudden
sting of the old fear giving sharpness
to his voice.</p>

<p>“Bonté divine! How monsieur
takes the word out of one’s mouth!”
ejaculated Angélique, throwing up
her hands like an aggrieved woman;
“why, a little distraction always
does good at mamselle’s age; look
at me: it would put new blood into
my old veins if I could go somewhere
and distract myself.”</p>

<p>“You find it very dull, my good
Angélique?” And the master turned
a kindly, almost penitent glance on
the nut-brown face.</p>

<p>“Hé! listen to him again! One
does not want to be dying of <i lang="fr">ennui</i>
to enjoy a little distraction; one
does not think of it, but when it
comes one may like it!” She gave
the shade a jerk that made it spin
round the lamp, and walked off in
high dudgeon.</p>

<p>Franceline was conscious of a
pleasurable flutter next day, when
she heard the carriage crunching
the gravel, and presently Lady
Anwyll came round on foot, followed
by the footman, who carried off
her box and secured it in some
mysterious part of the vehicle. She
was flushed when she kissed her
father and said good-by; he thought
it was the pleasure of the “little
distraction” that heightened her
color, and that took away the pang
of the short parting.</p>

<p>“Yes, decidedly, a change does
her good,” he mentally remarked;
“I must let her take advantage of
any pleasant one that offers.”</p>

<p>It was an event in Franceline’s
life, going to stay at a strange
house. The Court was too much
like her own home, and she had
known it too long and too early
to feel like a visitor there, or to
be overpowered by its splendors.
Rydal was not to be compared to
it either for architectural beauty or
magnitude, or for the extent and
beauty of the grounds and surrounding
scenery. The Court was a
grand baronial hall; Rydal was an
old-fashioned manor house; low-roofed,
straggling, and picturesque
outside; spacious and comfortable
inside; with enough of the marks
of time on the furniture and decorations
to stamp it as the abode of
many generations of gentlemen.
A low-ceiled square hall, with sitting-rooms
opening into it on either
side, and quaint pictures and arms
ornamenting its walls, received you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_750" id="Page_750">[750]</a></span>
with a hospitable hearth, where a
huge log was blazing cheerily under
a high, carved oak mantel-piece.
It was not flagged with marble, nor
supported by majestic columns like
the Gothic hall of the Court, but it
had a charm of its own that Franceline
felt, and expressed by a bright
exclamation as she alighted in it.</p>

<p>“Come in and sit down for a moment
in the drawing-room,” said
Lady Anwyll. “I always rest before
toiling up-stairs, my dear; and you
must fancy yourself an old woman
and do so too.”</p>

<p>Franceline followed her into the
handsome square room. Two projecting
windows thrust themselves
out to the west to catch the last
rays of the setting sun at one end,
and another bulged out southward
to sun itself in the noon-tide warmth;
an old-fashioned sofa was drawn
close to the fire. Franceline fancied
she saw the soles of two boots
resting on the arm facing the door;
and was beginning to wonder where
the body was that they might belong
to, when the dowager suddenly
cried out in tones of amazement
rather than delight:</p>

<p>“Good gracious, Ponce! what
brought you back, and when did
you come? I verily believe you
have got some talisman like Riquet
with the Tuft for flying about the
world like a bird! Where have
you come from now?”</p>

<p>She stooped down to kiss the invisible
head that lay at the other
end of the figure, and a voice from
the cushions answered: “I pledged
my word I would be back in a
day and a month; did you ever
know me break my word, lady mother?”</p>

<p>“You so seldom commit yourself
by pledging it to me that I
hardly remember; however, now
that you are here, I am glad to see
you, and to be able to offer you a
reward for your punctuality. Come
here, my dear, and let me introduce
my son Ponsonby to you.”</p>

<p>The recumbent giant was on his
feet in an instant, with an involuntary
“Hollo!” as Franceline advanced
at his mother’s bidding.</p>

<p>“This is Mlle. de la Bourbonais,
Ponce; my son, Captain Anwyll.”</p>

<p>“It is not often punishment overtakes
the guilty so fast,” said the
gentleman, with a very low bow,
and an awkward laugh; “I so seldom
indulge in the laziness of
stretching my long legs on a sofa,
that it’s rather hard on me that I
should be caught in the act by a
lady. Mother, you ought to have
given me notice in time.”</p>

<p>“Served you right! I’m glad
you were caught; and, my dear,
don’t you mind his <em>seldom</em>; when
he is not flying through the air or
over the water, this big son of mine
is stretching himself somewhere.
Come, now, and get your things
off.” As they were leaving the
room, she looked back to ask her
son if he “had brought the regiment
down with him,” and on hearing
that he had left that appendage
in Yorkshire, his mother observed
that it was like him to leave it behind
just when it might have been
useful.</p>

<p>There are some people who,
though inert and quiet themselves,
have a faculty for putting everybody
about them in a commotion. Ponsonby
Anwyll was one of these.
When he came down to Rydal it
was as if an earthquake shook the
place. He wanted next to no waiting
on, yet somehow every servant
in the house was busied about him.
He was like a baby in a house, exacting
nothing, but occupying everybody.</p>

<p>He was constantly either overturning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_751" id="Page_751">[751]</a></span>
something, or on the point
of doing it. Like so many men of
the giant type, he was as gentle as
a woman and as easily cowed;
and like a woman, he always wanted
somebody at his elbow to look
after him. If he attempted to light
a lamp, ten to one he upset it and
spoiled a table-cover or a carpet,
or he let the chimney fall, and cut
his fingers picking up the bits to
prevent some one else’s being cut.
He took next to no interest practically
in the estate; yet his tenantry
were very fond of him; he never
bothered them about improvements
or abuses, and they were more
obliged to him for letting them
alone than for benefiting them
against their will. Whenever he
interfered it was to take their part
against the agent, who could not
see why the tenants were to be let
off paying full rents because the
harvest happened to be a failure
one year, when it had been good so
many preceding ones. Lady Anwyll
would bully and storm and protest
that he was ruining the property,
and that they would all end in the
Union; but Ponsonby soon petted
her into good humor. In her heart
of hearts she was proud of her big,
easy-going son, who cared so little
for money, and she was as pleased
to be patronized by him as a little
kitten is when the powerful Newfoundland
condescends to a game
of romps with it.</p>

<p>When Franceline, in her white
muslin dress, floated into the drawing-room,
like a summer cloud, the
Newfoundland was standing on the
hearth-rug, with its eyes fixed expectantly
on the door. Lady
Anwyll was generally down long
before her son. Ponce took an age
to get out of one set of clothes and
into another; but he had the start
of her to-day.</p>

<p>“You have had a nice drive from
Dullerton,” he began; how else
could he begin? “But I fear the
weather is on the turn; those clouds
over the common look mischievous.”</p>

<p>“Are you weatherwise?” inquired
Franceline, following his eyes
to the window.</p>

<p>“Not he, my dear! He’s not
wise in anything!” answered a
voice from behind her.</p>

<p>“Mother, this is positively too
bad of you! I protest against your
taking away my character in this
fashion, before I have a chance of
making one with Miss Franceline.
You begin by making me out the
laziest dog in Christendom, and
now you would rob me of my one
intellectual quality! You know I
am weatherwise! They call me
Girouette in the 10th, because I can
tell to a feather how the wind is
blowing; ’pon my honor they do,
Miss Franceline!”</p>

<p>Franceline was going to assure
him of her entire faith in this assertion
when dinner was announced,
and they crossed the hall into the
dining-room.</p>

<p>“Now, tell us something about
where you’ve been and what you’ve
seen and done,” said the dowager;
“and try and be as entertaining as
you can, for you see there is no one
else to amuse my young friend.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I should be very proud;
I wish I could remember something
amusing to tell; but that’s the
deuce of it, the more a fellow wants
to be pleasant the less he can. Do
you care to hear about fishing?”
This was addressed to Franceline.
There was something so boyish in
his manner, such an entire absence
of conceit or affectation, that, in
spite of other deficiencies, she liked
the shy hussar, and felt at ease with
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_752" id="Page_752">[752]</a></span></p>

<p>“I dare say I should if I understood
it at all; but I do not. But I
am always curious to know about
foreign places and people,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m glad of that; I can tell
you plenty about no end of places,”
answered the traveller promptly;
“but I dare say you’ve seen them
all yourself; everybody goes everywhere
nowadays.”</p>

<p>“I have never been out of Dullerton
since I came here as a child,
but once for a few days to London,”
said Franceline; “so you can hardly
go wrong in telling me about any
foreign place.”</p>

<p>“How odd! Well, its rather refreshing
too. I suppose you are
nervous, afraid of the water, or the
railway?”</p>

<p>“Not the least. I am too poor
to travel.” She said it as simply
as if she had stated that the rain
had prevented her going for a
walk.</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed! That is a hindrance
to be sure,” blundered out Ponsonby;
“but people are better off that
stay at home. One is always within
an inch of getting one’s neck broken,
or one’s eye put out; and people
very often do come to grief
travelling. I dare say you wouldn’t
like it at all.”</p>

<p>“Getting her eyes put out? I
should think not!” chimed in his
mother, with a mocking chuckle.</p>

<p>“I meant the whole thing,” pursued
Ponce. “The only chance one
has is to go straight through like a
letter in the post, from one place to
another, and stick there, and not
go posting about from place to
place, as we did in Rome, now.
That is a pleasant place to go to.
I bet anything you’d enjoy Rome
awfully; everybody does; and now
they’ve got good hotels, and you
can get as good a dinner as any
fellow need care to eat. Only you
would not like the popish ways of
the place. That’s the deuce of it,
you can’t get out of the way of that
sort of thing; it’s in the air, you
see; but one grows used to it after
a while, as one does to the bad
smells.”</p>

<p>“I should not suffer from that. I
am a Catholic,” said Franceline, her
color rising slightly.</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed! I beg your pardon;
I had no idea; of course that
makes all the difference,” stammered
the hussar, mentally comparing
himself to Patrick, who could
never open his mouth without putting
his foot in it.</p>

<p>Lady Anwyll had now despatched
her dinner, or as much of the
long meal as she ever partook of.
Feeling that the conversation was
not progressing very favorably between
her son and her guest, she
took the reins in her own hand,
and by dint of direct questions and
an occasional touch of the spur she
managed to make time trot on in a
straggling but on the whole amusing
style of talk, half narrative,
half anecdote, until dinner was
ended, and she and Franceline migrated
to the drawing-room, leaving
the captain to discuss the claret
in solitary state.</p>

<p class="break">The next morning at breakfast
Lady Anwyll proposed that the two
young people should go for a ride
after lunch. Franceline demurred,
on the plea that she had never ridden
but one horse and was afraid
to trust herself on any other. The
captain, however, settled this difficulty,
by volunteering to send a
man over to Dullerton for Rosebud.
She would come at an easy pace,
and after an hour’s rest be ready
for the road. On seeing the point
so satisfactorily arranged, Franceline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_753" id="Page_753">[753]</a></span>
immediately dismissed her terrors,
and thought it would be rather
desirable to try how she could
manage on a strange horse. She
could not plead that she had forgotten
her riding habit, for Angélique
had remembered it, as well as
the hat and gloves and whip, all
of which had been packed up with
her other clothes.</p>

<p>The weather was fine, a bright
sun beamed from a stainless sky;
the furze on the common was yellow
enough still to illuminate the
flat expanse of the country round
Rydal, and as Franceline dashed
through the golden bushes on her
spirited steed, her youth vindicated
itself, the young blood coursed joyously
through her veins, her spirits
rose, and soon the exercise that
she begun reluctantly became one
of keen enjoyment. Capt. Anwyll
was not a very interesting companion,
but he was natural and good-natured,
and anxious to please; he
knew now what ground he was
treading, too, and made no more
blunders, but chatted on without
shyness or effort, and was pleasant
enough.</p>

<p>“Roxham is coming to dinner.
You know Roxham? A capital
fellow; a dead shot; a clever fellow
too; goes in strong for politics
and philanthropy and so forth.
He’ll be in the ministry one of
these days I dare say, and setting
the country by the ears with his reform
crochets, and that sort of
thing: his head is full of them.”</p>

<p>“Not a bad sort of furniture
either. Why don’t you follow his
example?” demanded Franceline.</p>

<p>“Me! How satirical you are!
That’s not my line at all. I don’t
go in for politics&mdash;only for soldiering,
if there were any to do. They
set me up as liberal candidate for
the last elections, but when I found
it was not to be a walk-over, and
that I was to contest it, I backed
out. My mother was dreadfully
savage. But bless her! she does
not understand it a bit. I’m no
hand at making speeches and addressing
constituents. Now, Roxham
can hold forth by the hour to
a mob, or to any set of fellows; it’s
wonderful to see how he spins out
the palaver&mdash;and first-rate palaver
it is, I can tell you. You should
hear him on the hustings! We’ll
make him describe a great row he
and the liberal candidate had at
the last elections, when Roxham
beat him out of the field in grand
style; he was no match for Roxham
anyhow, and besides he had a
stutter, and when he was in a passion
he couldn’t get a word out
without stamping like a vicious
horse. It’s great fun to hear Roxham
tell it; we’ll make him do so
this evening. It will amuse you.”</p>

<p>Franceline laughed. The name
of Lord Roxham and the mention
of his electioneering feats recalled
a scene that was seldom absent
from her memory now. Every trifling
detail of that scene rose vividly
before her as she listened to
Captain Anwyll. Would he never
allude to one figure in it that overshadowed
every other? If she
could but lead him to speak of
Clide! Perhaps he could tell her
something of his present movements;
throw some light on her
perplexity.</p>

<p>“Lord Roxham has a very handsome
cousin, Lady Emily Fitznorman;
do you know her?” she asked,
carelessly.</p>

<p>“Yes. A very nice girl as well
as handsome.”</p>

<p>“I wonder she’s not married already.”</p>

<p>“You think she’s on the wane!
Wait a while; you won’t think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_754" id="Page_754">[754]</a></span>
three-and-twenty so antique by and
by.”</p>

<p>“I did not mean that; I thought
she was about my own age,” protested
Franceline with vivacity;
“but when one is so much admired
as Lady Emily seemed to be
that night at Dullerton, one wonders
she is not carried off by some
devoted admirer.”</p>

<p>“Then you noticed that she had
a great many? Would it be unfair
to ask a few names?”</p>

<p>“Mr. de Winton for one seemed
very devoted.”</p>

<p>“De Winton! Humph! Who
else?”</p>

<p>“Why do you say ‘humph’? Is
there reason why he should not be
amongst the number?”</p>

<p>“Rather&mdash;that is to say perhaps&mdash;in
fact, thereby hangs a tale.”
His face wore a quizzical expression
as he spoke.</p>

<p>“What tale?” She looked round
with a quick, curious glance.</p>

<p>“Oh! it’s not fair to tell tales out
of school, is it?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not; I had no idea
there was a secret in the way,” said
Franceline, bridling.</p>

<p>Ponsonby was not gifted with the
knack of calm irrelevance; instead
of dropping the subject and turning
to something else, he resumed
presently:</p>

<p>“De Winton is a capital shot
too&mdash;better than Roxham; I went
boar-hunting with him in Germany
three years ago, and then black-cock
shooting in Prussia, and I never
knew him to miss his aim once.”</p>

<p>“He will come home laden with
bears this time no doubt,” she remarked
with affected coolness.</p>

<p>“Bears! not he. He has other
game to follow now. Are you up
to taking that fence, or shall we go
round by the bridle-path? It
makes it a good bit longer?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care to take the fence.
Let us go round.”</p>

<p>She put her horse at a canter,
and they scarcely spoke again until
they reached Rydal.</p>

<p>Lady Anwyll’s voice sounded
from the drawing-room, summoning
her to come in before going upstairs,
but Franceline did not heed
it. She went straight to her room;
she must have a few moments
alone; she could not talk or listen
just now. While she was flying
through the air, it seemed as if motion
suspended thought, and kept
her poised above the mental whirlwind
that Capt. Anwyll’s words
had evoked; but once standing
with the ground firm under her
feet, thought resumed its power,
and shook off the temporary torpor.
She closed her door, and proceeded
quietly to take off her habit. As
she did so a voice kept repeating
distinctly in her ears, “He has
other game to follow now!” What
did it, could it mean? Why, since
he had said so much, could he not
in mercy have said something more?
But what did Capt. Anwyll know
about mercy in the matter? What
was Mr. de Winton to her in his
eyes? Nothing, thank heaven!
Nor in any one else’s. It was from
mystery to mystery; she could
make nothing out of it. One fact
alone grew clearer and clearer to
her amidst the dim chaos&mdash;Clide
de Winton was the loadstar that
was drawing her thoughts, her longings,
her life after him wherever he
was. Everything else was vague
and undefined. She could not blame
any one; she could not grieve or
lament; she could only lose herself
in torturing conjecture. It wanted
more than an hour to dinner-time.
Franceline had not the courage to
spend it in the drawing-room, where
she would be the object of Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_755" id="Page_755">[755]</a></span>
Anwyll’s motherly petting, and
Ponsonby’s flat gossip; she must
have the interval to school herself
for the effort that was before her
for the rest of the evening. There
were steps on the landing; she
opened her door; one of the maids
was passing.</p>

<p>“Please tell her ladyship that I
am a little tired, and shall lie down
for half an hour before I dress.”
The servant took the message.</p>

<p>Franceline did not lie down,
however; she seated herself before
the window, and thought. The exercise
was not soothing, but it was
a respite; and when she made her
appearance in the drawing-room,
there was so little trace of fatigue
about her that Lady Anwyll rallied
her good-naturedly on the cruelty
of having stayed away under false
pretences.</p>

<p>Lord Roxham met her with the
frankness of an old acquaintance,
and had many pretty speeches to
make about their last meeting.
Franceline responded with sprightly
grace, and hoped he had come prepared
to complete her education in
parliamentary matters. The evening
passed off gaily. Lord Roxham
was a fluent if not a brilliant talker,
and under the animating influence
of his lively rattle, Franceline’s
spirits rose, and her hosts, who had
hitherto seen her rather willing to be
amused than amusing, were surprised
to see with what graceful spirit
she kept the ball going, bandying
light repartee with Lord Roxham,
and pricking Ponsonby into joining
in the game with a liveliness
that astonished him and enchanted
his mother. The dowager chuckled
inwardly, and applauded herself on
the success of her little matrimonial
scheme; she already saw Franceline
a peeress, and happily settled
as a near neighbor of her own.
None of the party were musical,
but they did not miss this delightful
element of sociability, so unflagging
was the flow of talk and anecdote;
and when Lord Roxham
started up at eleven o’clock to ring
for his horse, every one protested
he must have heard the clock strike
one too many.</p>

<p>“Come and lunch to-morrow,
and join these two in their ride,”
said Lady Anwyll, as she shook
hands with him.</p>

<p>“Am I going to ride home?”
inquired Franceline, surprised.</p>

<p>“Certainly not! Nor drive either.
You don’t suppose I’m going to let
you off with one day’s penance?”</p>

<p>“O dear Lady Anwyll! papa
will expect me to-morrow, and he
will be uneasy if he does not see
me; I assure you he will,” pleaded
Franceline.</p>

<p>“I can remove that obstacle,”
said Lord Roxham promptly. “I
must ride over to Dullerton early
to-morrow morning, and I can have
the honor of calling at M. de la
Bourbonais’, and setting his mind
at rest about you.”</p>

<p>“The very thing!” cried Lady
Anwyll, shutting up Franceline,
who had an excuse ready; “you
can call at The Lilies on your way
back, and tell the count he is to expect
this young lady when he sees
her.”</p>

<p>Luckily Franceline was ignorant
of the juxtaposition of the various
seats round Dullerton, or it might
have struck her as odd that Lady
Anwyll should propose the messenger’s
going a round of fifteen miles
to call at The Lilies “on his way
back.” But she suspected nothing,
and when Lord Roxham alighted
at Rydal next day punctually as
the clock struck two <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> she greeted
him with unabashed cordiality,
and was all eagerness to know if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_756" id="Page_756">[756]</a></span>
had seen her father, and what the
latter had said.</p>

<p>She had slept restlessly, but she
had slept; her anxiety had not as
yet the sting in it that destroys
sleep. She did not fail to notice
with renewed wonder that Lord
Roxham had studiously avoided
mentioning Mr. de Winton’s name.
Studiously it must have been; for
what more natural than to have
mentioned him when discussing the
fairy <i lang="it">festa</i> where they had first met?
She felt certain there must be a
motive for so palpable a reticence,
and the thought did not tend to reassure
her. She had dressed herself
before luncheon, so when the
horses came round, they mounted
at once. Franceline, on starting,
had mentally resolved to make
Lord Roxham speak on the subject
that was uppermost in her mind&mdash;to
put a direct question in fact, if
everything else failed&mdash;but, strive
as she might, he would not be lured
into the trap, and her courage sank
so much on seeing this that she
dared not venture on a direct interrogation.</p>

<p>They stayed out until near sundown;
the day was breezy and
bright, and Franceline looked radiant
with the excitement and exercise.</p>

<p>“Let us ride up to the knoll and
see the sun go down behind the
common,” proposed Capt. Anwyll,
as they were about to pass the
park gate; “the sunset is the only
thing we have worth showing at
Rydal, and I’d like Mlle. de la
Bourbonais to see it.”</p>

<p>His companions gladly assented,
and the party turned off the road
into a bridle-path across the fields
which led to the elevation commanding
an unbroken view of the
spectacle. It seemed as if everything
had been purposely cleared
away from the landscape that could
divert attention for an instant from
the glorious pageant of the western
skies. Not a house was visible,
and scarcely a habitation; the cottages
were hid in the flanks of the
valley, and only reminded you of
their existence by a thin vapor that
curled up from a solitary chimney
and quickly lost itself in the trees.
Nothing gave any sign of life but
the sheep browsing on the gilded
emerald of the shorn meadows.
The red and gold waves flooded
the vast expanse of the horizon,
flowing further and higher as the
spectators gazed, until half heaven
was on fire with a conflagration of
rainbows. Swiftly the colors changed,
crimson and orange first, then
deep and tender shades of purple
and green, until all melted into uniform
violet, the herald of the gathering
darkness. They stood watching
it in silence, Franceline with
bated breath. The sunset always
had a solemn charm for her, and
she had never seen so vast and gorgeous
a one as this. It was like
watching the dying throes of a divinity.</p>

<p>“The play is over, the audience
may retire!” said Ponsonby, breaking
the pause; even he had been
subdued by the sublimity of the
scene.</p>

<p>“If I were a pagan I should be a
fire-worshipper,” said Franceline,
as they moved away. “I think the
worship of the sun is the most natural
as well as the most poetic of
all forms of idolatry.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what De Winton
said the first time he saw the sun
set from here!” exclaimed Capt.
Anwyll triumphantly; “how comical
that you should have hit on the
very same idea! He said, by the
way, that it was the finest sunset he
had ever seen in England; it’s so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_757" id="Page_757">[757]</a></span>
wide and low, you see; he showed
me a sketch he made of a sunset
somewhere in the Vosges that he
said it reminded him of. I forget
the name of the valley; but it was
uncommonly like; do you know
the Vosges?”</p>

<p>“No; I have never been to that
part of France.”</p>

<p>Lord Roxham glanced at her as
she said this in a clear, low voice.
He saw nothing in her countenance
that afforded a clew to whatever
he was looking for.</p>

<p>It had grown chilly now that the
sun had set, and they had been
standing several minutes on the
knoll. Of one accord the three
riders broke into a gallop as they
entered the park, and dashed along
between the pollard Wellingtonias,
standing stiff and stark as tumuli
on either side of the long avenue.</p>

<p>Lady Anwyll had gone to visit
some poor sick woman in the
neighborhood, and had not yet
returned. The gentlemen went
round to the stables, and Franceline
to her room. She dressed
herself quickly, wrote a short letter
to her father according to her
promise of writing to him every
day during her absence, and then
threw the window wide open and
sat down beside it. It was fresh
enough, and she wore only her
muslin dress, but she did not feel
the freshness of the air&mdash;she was
too excited to be conscious of any
external influence of the kind. She
sat as motionless as a statue, gazing
abstractedly over the empurpled
sky where the moon appeared like
a shred of white cloud. She had
not sat there long when the fragrant
fumes of a cigar came floating in
through her window, followed soon
by a sound of footsteps and voices.
Ponsonby and his guest were coming
in. Franceline did not close
the window or move away, though
the voices were now audible; the
speakers had not entered the
house; they were walking under
the veranda that ran round the
front. What matter? They were
not likely to be talking secrets;
she was welcome to listen, no doubt,
to whatever they might have to
say.</p>

<p>“There is the carriage coming,”
said Ponsonby; “my mother is out
too late with her rheumatism; I’ll
pitch into her for it.”</p>

<p>“Yes; it doesn’t do to stay out
after sunset when one has any
chronic ailment of that sort. By
the way, you mentioned De Winton
just now; have you heard of him
lately?”</p>

<p>“No; not since he left Berlin.
It seems he was very near kicking
the bucket there; he was awfully
bad, and nobody with him but his
man Stanton.”</p>

<p>“How did you hear about it?”</p>

<p>“Through Parker, a fellow in
our regiment whose brother is <i lang="fr">attaché</i>
at Berlin; the story made a
sensation there, but no one knew
of it until De Winton had left.”</p>

<p>The speakers passed on to the
end of the veranda, and Franceline
could catch nothing more until
they drew near again. Lord Roxham
was speaking.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow! It’s tremendously
hard on him, and I believe there is
no redress; nothing to make out a
case for divorce.”</p>

<p>“I fancy not; but even if there
were it would not be available,
since he’s a Romanist.”</p>

<p>“Ah! to be sure; I forgot that;
but what a mystification the whole
business is! I’ve known De Winton
since we were both boys&mdash;we
were Eton chums, you know&mdash;but
he never breathed a word of it to
me. Yet he’s not a close fellow;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_758" id="Page_758">[758]</a></span>
quite the contrary. And who the
deuce is the woman? Where did
he come across her?”</p>

<p>They passed out of hearing
again, and when they returned the
tramping of horses and the crunching
of wheels overtopped their
voices. The sounds all died away;
Lady Anwyll had come in, and
gone to her room&mdash;every one was
waiting in the drawing-room, but
Franceline did not appear. Her
hostess, thinking she had not heard
the dinner-bell, sent for her. Presently
the maid came rushing down
the stairs and into the forbidden
precincts of the drawing-room with
a scared face.</p>

<p>“Please, my lady, she’s in a dead
faint! I found her all in a heap on
the floor, ready dressed. I lifted
her on to the bed, but she don’t
move!”</p>

<p>An exclamation burst simultaneously
from the three listeners. In
a moment they were all in Franceline’s
room; there she lay stretched
on the bed, as the woman had
said, white and still as death, one
hand hanging, and her hair, that
had been loosened in the fall, dropping
on her shoulder. The usual
restoratives were applied, and in
about a quarter of an hour she
gave signs of awakening&mdash;the veined
lids quivered, the mouth twitched
convulsively, and a short sigh
escaped her. Lady Anwyll signed
to her son and Lord Roxham to
withdraw; they had scarcely left
the room when Franceline opened
her eyes and stared about her with
the blank gaze of returning consciousness.
She swallowed some
wine at Lady Anwyll’s request, but
soon put the glass away with a gesture
of disgust. In answer to her
hostess’ anxious entreaties to say
where she suffered, and why she
had swooned, the young girl could
only say she had felt tired and
weary, and that she longed to be
left alone and go to sleep. Lady
Anwyll agreed that sleep would be
the best restorative, and insisted
on staying till she saw her settled
in bed; then she kissed her, and
promising to come soon and see if
she was asleep, she left the room
with a noiseless step.</p>

<p>“What is it? Is there anything
much amiss, mother?” was the captain’s
exclamation. Lord Roxham
was equally concerned.</p>

<p>“Nothing, except you have nearly
killed her, both of you. You
have ridden the child to death;
she is not accustomed to it, and she
has overdone herself; but she will
be all right I hope in the morning.
There’s nothing the matter but
fatigue, she assures me.”</p>

<p>Ponsonby rated himself soundly
for being such a brute as to have
let her tire herself; he ought to
have remembered that she was done
up the day before after a much
shorter ride. He was awfully
sorry. His remorse was no doubt
quite genuine, but when they sat
down to dinner he proved to demonstration
that that feeling is compatible
with an unimpaired appetite.
Lady Anwyll left them before they
had finished to see how Franceline
was going on; she found her awake,
but quite well, and going to sleep
very soon, she assured the kind old
lady.</p>

<p>“Then, my dear child, I will not
have you disturbed again; if you
wake and want anything, strike this
gong, and Trinner will come at
once. I will make her sleep in the
room next yours to-night.”</p>

<p>Franceline protested, but the
dowager silenced her with a kiss;
put out the light, and left her.</p>

<p>She lay very still, but there was
no chance of sleep for her. Sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_759" id="Page_759">[759]</a></span>
had fled from her eyes as peace had
fled from her heart. She longed to
get up, and find relief from the intolerable
strain of immobility, but
she dared not; her room was over
a part of the drawing-room, and she
might be heard. The evening
seemed to drag on with preternatural
slowness. She could hear the
low hum of voices through the
ceiling. Once there was a clatter
of porcelain&mdash;probably Ponce overturning
the tea-tray. At last the
stable-clock struck eleven; there
was opening and shutting of doors
for a while, and then silence.
Franceline sat up and listened
until not a sound was anywhere
to be heard. Every soul in the
house had gone to bed. Trinner
had come last of all to her room.
The star made by her candle gleamed
through the key-hole for a long
time; at last it disappeared, and
soon the loud, regular breathing
told that she was fast asleep. Franceline
rose, threw her dressing-wrapper
round her, and drew back
the curtain from the window. It
was a relief to let the night-lights
in upon her solitude; the glorious
gaze of the moon seemed to chase
away phantoms with the darkness.
She felt awake now. All
this time, lying there in the utter
darkness, it seemed as if she were
still in a swoon, or held in the grip
of a nightmare; she shook herself
free from the benumbing clutch,
and sat down close by the window,
and tried to collect her thoughts.
There was one phantom which the
moonlight could not dispel; it
stood out now distinctly as she
looked at it with revived consciousness.
Clide de Winton was a married
man. It was to the husband of
another that she had given her
heart with its first pure vintage of
impassioned love. He who had
looked at her with those ardent
eyes, penetrating her soul like flame,
had all along been another woman’s
husband. There was no more room
for hope, even for doubt; suspense
was at an end; the period of dark
conjecture was gone. It was clear
enough, all that had been so inexplicable,&mdash;clear
as when the lightning
flashes out of a lurid sky, and
illuminates the scene of an earthquake;
a sea lashed to fury by
winds that have lost their current,
ships sinking in billows that break
before they heave, the land gaping
and groaning, trees uprooted, habitations
falling with a crash of thunder,
all live things clinging and flying
in wild disorder. Franceline
considered it all as she sat, still and
white as a stone, without missing a
single detail in the scene.</p>

<p>Violent demonstration was not
in her nature. In pain or in joy it
was her habit to be self-contained.
She had as yet been called upon
but for very slight trials of strength
and self-control; but such as the
experience was it had left behind
it an innate though unconscious
sense of power that rose instinctively
to her aid now. She had fainted
away under the first shock of the
discovery; but that tribute of
weakness paid to nature, she would
yield no more. Tears might come
later; but now she would not indulge
in them. She must face the
worst without flinching. What was
the worst? Clide was a married
man. That was bad enough in all
conscience; yet there might be
worse behind. Circumstances might
cast a blacker dye even on this.
Lord Roxham had spoken in a tone
of sympathy: “Poor fellow! It’s
tremendously hard on him.…”
He would have spoken differently
if there were any villany in question.
But if Lord Roxham had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_760" id="Page_760">[760]</a></span>
thus indirectly acquitted him, Franceline
would have done so spontaneously.
Yes, even in the first moment
of despair, while the flood was
sweeping over her, she acquitted
him. He had dragged her down
into unsounded depths of agony
and shame, but he had not done it
deliberately; he was neither a liar
nor a traitor. Had he not been
brought to the jaws of death himself
only a month ago? There was
an indescribable comfort in the pang
those words had inflicted. He too,
then, was suffering; they were both
victims. Clide had never meant to
deceive her; she would have sworn
it on the altar of her unshaken faith
in him; she wanted no stronger evidence
than the promptings of her
own heart. She was confident there
would be some adequate explanation
of whatever now seemed ambiguous,
when she should have learned
all. No; she need not separate
the attribute of truth and honor
from his image; she could no more
do it than she could separate the
idea of light from the pure maiden
moon that was looking down on
her from heaven; she would see
darkness in light before she would
believe Clide de Winton false.</p>

<p>This irrepressible need of her
heart once satisfied&mdash;Clide judged
and acquitted&mdash;what then? Granted
that he was innocent as yonder
stars, how did it affect her? What
did it signify to her henceforth
whether he was innocent or guilty,
true or false? He was the husband
of another woman; as good
as dead to Franceline de la Bourbonais;
parted from her by a more
impassable barrier than death. If
he were only dead she might love
him still, hold him enshrined in her
heart’s core with a clasp that death
could not sever&mdash;only strengthen.
But he was worse than dead; he
was married. She must banish
him even from her thoughts; his
memory must henceforth be as far
from her as the thought of murder,
or any other crime that her crystal
conscience shuddered even to name.
She might acquit him, crown him
with the noblest attributes of manhood;
but that done, she must dismiss
him from her remembrance,
and forget him as if he had never
lived.</p>

<p>Franceline had remained seated,
her hands locked passively in her
lap, while these thoughts shaped
themselves in her mind. When they
reached the climax, expressed in
these words: “I must forget him
as if he had never lived!” she rose
to her feet, clasped her forehead in
both hands, and an inarticulate cry
broke from her: “It would be
easier to die!… If I had anything
to forgive, that would help
me! But I have nothing to forgive!”
It would not have helped
her, though she fancied so; it would
have turned the bitterness of the
cup into poison. But she could
not realize this now. It seemed
harder to renounce what was good
and beautiful than to cast away
what was unworthy. If the idol
had uttered one false oracle, demanded
anything base, betrayed itself
before betraying her, it would
have been easier, she thought, to
overturn it. Indignation would
have nerved her to the deed, and
she would have dealt the blow without
compunction. But it had done
nothing to forfeit her love and trust,
and nevertheless she must dash it
down and cast the fragments into
the fire, and not preserve even the
dust as a precious thing. What a
merciful doom his death would
have been compared to this!</p>

<p>How was she to do it? Who
would help her to so ruthless a demolition?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_761" id="Page_761">[761]</a></span>
Did any one speak in
the silence, or was it only the unspoken
cry of her own soul that
answered? She had fancied herself
alone; she had forgotten that
a Presence was close to her, waiting
to be invoked, patient, faithful,
and protecting even while forgotten.
The voice sounded sweet in
its warning solemnity, and filled the
lonely chamber with a more benign
ray than ever shone from midnight
sky or blazing noon. Franceline
stretched out her arms to meet it,
and with a loud sob fell upon her
knees. “O my God! forgive me!
Forgive me, and help me! I have
sinned, but my punishment is greater
than I can bear!” The floodgates
were thrown back; the tears
fell in hot showers, the sobs shook
her as the storm shakes the sapling.
She knelt there crouching in
the darkness, her head leaning on
her folded arms, and gave herself
up to the passionate outburst, like
a child weeping itself to sleep on
its mother’s breast. But this could
not last. It was only a truce. The
real battle, the decisive one, had
only now begun; what had gone
before were but the preliminaries.
Hitherto she had thought only of
her grief and humiliation; she was
now brought face to face with her
sin&mdash;the sin of idolatry. She had
made unto herself an idol of clay,
and placed it on the altar of her
heart, and burned incense before it
with every breath she drew; the
smoke had made a mist before her
eyes, but it was dissolving. She
looked into the desecrated sanctuary,
and struck her breast with humility
and self-abasement. Her
tears were flowing copiously, but
they were not all brine; she was
drawing strength from their bitterness.
Victory was not for “the
days of peace,” but for such an
hour as this. She had been trained
from childhood in the hope of
heaven, in the firm belief that this
life was but the transitory passage
to the true home; that its sorrows
and joys were too evanescent, too
unreal to be counted of more importance
than the rain and wind
that scatter the sunshine of a summer’s
day; she had been taught,
too, that the bliss of that immortal
home is purchased by suffering&mdash;a
thing to be taken by violence, a
crown to be grasped through thorns.
Hitherto her adherence to this
creed had been entirely theoretical;
she accepted it, but in some vague
way felt that she, personally, was
beyond its action. Her father had
suffered; her mother, too, cut off in
her happy bloom, had won the
crown by a lingering illness and an
early death; but she, Franceline,
enjoyed, it would seem, some privileged
immunity from the stern
law. Such had unawares been her
reasoning. But now she was undeceived;
her hour had come, and
she must meet it as a Christian.
Now was the time to prove the sincerity
of her faith, the strength of
her principles; if they failed her,
they were no better than stubble
and brass that dissolve at the first
breath of the furnace.</p>

<p>A duel to the death is always
brief: the foes close in mortal conflict;
the thrusts come fast and
sharp; one or other falls. When
Franceline lifted her head from her
arms, the expression of the tear-stained
face showed which way the
battle had gone: the victor stood
erect with his foot upon the victim’s
neck, unscathed, serene, and
pitiless. Love lay bleeding and
maimed, but Conscience smiled
in triumph. “I will not let thee
go until thou hast blessed me,”
the wrestler had said, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_762" id="Page_762">[762]</a></span>
angel had blessed her before he
fled.</p>

<p>The night was nearly spent when
Franceline rose up from her knees,
numbed and shivering, although
the weather was not cold. She
walked rapidly up and down for
a few moments to warm herself;
there was a spring in her step, a
light in her eyes, that told of recovered
energy and unshaken purpose;
her nerves might tingle, her
heart might grieve, but they would
neither faint nor quail. She dropped
on her knees again for one moment
and uttered a prayer, more
of thanksgiving this time than supplication,
and then lay down and
soon fell asleep.</p>

<p class="break">When Franceline came down next
morning, after breakfasting in her
room as if she had been ailing,
there was scarcely any trace in her
aspect of the conflict of the night.
Eyes do not retain the stains of
tears very long at eighteen, and if
she was a trifle paler than usual, it
was accounted for by the over-exertion
which had brought the fainting
fit. She expressed a wish to
go home as early as was convenient
to her hosts, and they consented
with reluctance, but without offering
any resistance. Lady Anwyll
said the child was weary and dull,
and that the next time she came to
Rydal they should make it livelier
for her.</p>

<p>With what a feeling of regaining
a haven of rest did Franceline enter
the little garden at The Lilies,
where her father, warned by the
sound of the wheels, hastened out
and stood waiting to clasp her!&mdash;Angélique
graciously letting him
have the first kiss, before she claimed
her turn.</p>

<p>“We have been like fishes out
of water without thee!&mdash;have we
not, ma bonne?” was Raymond’s
joyful exclamation, as he gathered
his child to his heart, and then
held her from him to look wistfully
into the sweet, smiling face.</p>

<p>“Yes, we were dull enough without
our singing bird, though I dare
say she didn’t miss us much!” was
Angélique’s rejoinder. Franceline
declared she would go away very
soon again to teach them to value
her more.</p>

<p>But the singing bird was not the
same after this. The spirit that
had found utterance in its joyous
voice was dead. A lark rises from
the clover-field, and pours out its
sweet, “harmonious madness” over
the earth; swiftly it soars away&mdash;away&mdash;into
fathomless space, and while,
spell-bound, we strain after the fading
notes, lo! the sportsman’s arrow
hisses by, a cry rends the welkin,
the songster is struck&mdash;he will
never sing again.</p>

<p>Perhaps you despise Franceline
for allowing the loss of an imaginary
possession to put the light out
of her life in this way. As if our
lives were not made desolate half
the time by the loss of what we
never had! You will say that self-respect
and pride ought to have
come to her aid, and enabled her
to quench in blood, if needs be,
the fire that her conscience pronounced
guilty. But is the process
so quickly accomplished, think
you? Franceline was doing her
best; she was concentrating all the
energies of her mind and soul in
the struggle, but it was not to be
done in a day; the very purity of
her love constituted its strength.
If there had been the smallest element
of corruption in it, it would
have died quicker; but its fibres were
enduring because they were pure.</p>

<p>Yet she was not forgetful of her
father and of all that he had hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_763" id="Page_763">[763]</a></span>
been to her, and she to him;
far from it. The effort to conceal
her sufferings from him was a great
help to her in controlling them,
though it often taxed her strength
severely. Sometimes, when the
feeling of isolation pressed on her
almost beyond endurance, when
she felt that she must have the solace
of his sympathy, cost what it
might, she would steal into his
study, determined to speak and let
the murder out; but the sight of
the venerable head bowed over his
books, absorbed, and happy in his
unconsciousness, would arrest her
words and choke them back into
silence. The strain was hard, but
was it not a mercy that she had as
yet only her own burden to bear?
What a price would she not have
to pay for the momentary relief of
leaning it on him! What might
not be dreaded from the effect of
the revelation on his sensitive
pride, and still more sensitive
love? And then the inevitable
breach between him and his oldest,
almost his only friend, Sir Simon!
They would leave The
Lilies and go forth she knew not
where. No; silence indubitably
was best. To speak might be to
kill her father.</p>

<p>This state of things lasted for
a week, and then there was granted
an alleviation. Father Henwick
had been called to a distance
to see his mother, who was
dying; he arrived in time to assist
her with his filial ministry in the
last passage; remained to settle all
that followed, and then came back
to resume the even tenor of his life
at Dullerton.</p>

<p>Father Henwick was one of those
men whom you may know for a lifetime,
and never find out until some
special circumstance reveals them.
There was no sign in his outward
man of anything remarkable in the
inner man. He had not acquired,
or at any rate retained, any French
polish or grace from his early sojourn
at the French seminary. His
manners were very homely, and
abrupt almost to brusqueness; he
was neither tall nor small, but of
that height which steers between
the two, and so escapes notice; his
voice had the unmistakable ring
of refinement and early education,
yet he seldom associated with his
equals, his intercourse being confined
chiefly to the poor. These
and their children were his familiars
at Dullerton. The latter looked on
him as their especial property, and
took all manner of liberties with
him unrebuked&mdash;hanging on to his
coat-tails, and plunging their audacious
little paws into the sacred
precincts of his pockets, whence experience
had taught them something
might turn up to their advantage:
penny whistles, Dutch dolls, buns,
lollypops, and crackers were continually
issuing from those mysterious
depths which the small fry sounded
behind Father Henwick’s back,
and apparently unbeknown to him,
while he administered comfort of
another description to their elders.</p>

<p>The fact of his having been educated
in France, and speaking
French like a Frenchman, accounted
to the general mind of Dullerton
for the eccentric habits and unconventional
manners of the Catholic
priest, especially for his shyness
with his own class, and undue familiarity
with those in the humbler
ranks. It ought to have established
him on the footing of close intimacy
at The Lilies; and yet it had
not done so. M. de le Bourbonais
professed and felt the greatest esteem
for him, and made him welcome
in his gracious way; but Father
Henwick was too shrewd an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_764" id="Page_764">[764]</a></span>
observer of human nature not to
see exactly how far this was meant
to go. Franceline’s early instruction
had been confided to him, and
the remembrance of the pains he had
taken with the little catechumen,
the fondness with which he had
planted and fostered the good seed
in her heart, made a claim on Raymond’s
gratitude; but it did not
remove an intangible barrier between
the father in the flesh and the
father in the spirit. M. de la Bourbonais
was a Catholic; if anybody had
dared to impugn by one word the
stanchness of his Catholicity, he
would have felt it his painful duty to
run that person through the body;
but, as with so many of his countrymen,
his faith ended here; it was altogether
theoretical; he was ready at
a moment’s notice to fight or die
for it; but it did not enter into his
views to live for it. For Franceline,
however, it was a different
thing. Religion was made for
women, and women for religion.
With that tender reverence for his
child’s faith, which in France is so
often the last bulwark of the father’s,
Raymond had been at considerable
pains to hide from Franceline the inconsistency
that existed between his
own practice and teaching. When
the great event was approaching
which, in the life of a French child
especially, is surrounded by such
touching solemnity, he made it his
delight to assist Father Henwick
in preparing her for it, making her
rehearse his instructions between
times, or teaching her the catechism
himself. Then, to anticipate
awkward questions and impossible
explanations, he made a point of
rising early on Sundays and festivals
and going to first Mass before
Franceline was out of bed. The
habit once contracted, he continued
it; so it came about naturally that
she took for granted her father did
at a different hour what he attached
so much importance to her doing.
In conversation with Father
Henwick she had more than once
incidentally let this belief transpire;
but he was not the one to undeceive
her, or tear away the veil
that parental sensitiveness had
drawn between itself and those
childlike eyes. Neither was he
one to broach the subject indiscreetly
to M. de la Bourbonais. A day
might come for speaking; meanwhile
he was content to be silent
and to wait.</p>

<p>The day Father Henwick returned
to Dullerton after his mother’s
funeral, his confessional was
surrounded by a greater crowd than
usual; his parishioners had a whole
week’s arrears of troubles and questions,
spiritual and temporal, to settle
with him, and it was late when
he was able to speak to Franceline.
The conference was a long one;
by the time it was over the church
was nearly empty; only a few figures
were still kneeling in the shadows
as the young girl, coming out
through a side-door, walked through
the graves with a quick, light step
and proceeded homewards. Tears
were falling under her veil, and a
sob every now and then showed
that the source was still full to
overflowing; but her heart was
lighter than it had been for many
days, her will was strengthened and
her purpose fixed. She was bent
on being courageous, on walking
forward bravely and never looking
back. She blessed God for the
comfort she had received and the
strength that had been imparted to
her. Oh! she was glad now that
she had resisted the first impulse to
speak to her father, and had been
silent.</p>

<p>That evening M. de la Bourbonais<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_765" id="Page_765">[765]</a></span>
and Angélique remarked
how cheerful she was. She stayed
up later than usual reading to Raymond,
and commenting spiritedly
on what she read; then bade him
good-night with almost a rejoicing
heart, and slept soundly until long
past daybreak.</p>

<h3>A VISIT TO IRELAND IN 1874.</h3>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Bernard at the
close of a long discussion, “it <em>is</em>
quite marvellous how little Englishmen
know about Ireland! And
their prejudices are the necessary
consequence of such ignorance! I
wish they could be <em>made</em> to travel
there more!”</p>

<p>No one, perhaps, more heartily
agreed with him than I did, taught
by my experiences of last autumn,
which occurred in the following
manner.</p>

<p>I had been sometime absent from
that country, a resident in London,
when I unexpectedly received a
pressing invitation last September,
from a friend living in the County
Westmeath, to cross St. George’s
Channel and pay her my long-promised
visit. “Westmeath!” exclaimed
my London circle&mdash;“Westmeath!
You must not dream of it!
You’ll be shot, my dear!” said
one old lady. “Taken up by the
police!” said another. “It’s ridiculous,
absurd!” cried a third. “Remember
the Peace-Preservation
Act and all that implies&mdash;murders,
Fenians, Ribbonmen, police! Don’t
risk your precious life amongst
them, or we shall never lay eyes
upon you again!” And they all
looked as solemn as if they had received
an invitation to attend my
Requiem, and were meditating what
flowers to choose for the wreaths
each meant to lay upon my coffin.</p>

<p>Nothing, however, made me hesitate.
Go I would, in defiance of
all their remonstrances; for, I argued,
if my friend, who herself owned
land in Westmeath, could live
there and see no impropriety in
asking me, as a matter of course I
should run no risk in accepting her
invitation. At length, finding me
obstinate, my cousin, Harry West,
came forward, and, volunteering
to escort me, promised my relatives
that he would judge for himself,
and if he saw danger would insist
on my returning with him. He was
a middle-aged man, land agent of
an estate in Buckinghamshire&mdash;one
of the most peaceful counties in the
United Kingdom&mdash;had never set
foot in Ireland, but, having been
studying the Irish question&mdash;as he
thought&mdash;and poring over the debates
on this same Peace-Preservation
Act last session, held even
gloomier views concerning Ireland
than any of my other numerous acquaintances.
In consequence, I looked
upon this as the most self-sacrificing
act of friendship he could
possibly offer. At the same time, I
accepted it.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we started by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_766" id="Page_766">[766]</a></span>
night mail which leaves Euston
Square at twenty-five minutes past
eight <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p>For the first two hours I was
haunted, I confess, by the dread
of the Scotch limited mail running
into us, as I knew it was to leave
the same spot only five minutes
later; and both trains being express,
if any hitch should occur to us between
the stations, we might “telescope”
each other without any
means of preventing it. At least,
so it seemed to my ignorant mind.
Harry fortunately knew nothing of
this; but his thoughts were none
the less running upon danger, remembering
some terrible accidents
to this same Irish mail&mdash;notably
the one some four years ago, when
Lord and Lady Farnham, Judge
Berwick and his sister, and others
we knew, were reduced to a heap
of ashes in a few minutes by an explosion
of petroleum which caught
fire in a collision. Luckily, Harry
fell asleep on quitting Chester, and
never noticed the fatal spot, nor
awoke until we drew up at five minutes
past three <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> alongside the
mail packet <cite>Leinster</cite> some way out
on the pier at Holyhead.</p>

<p>The night was fine, the sea calm,
the passengers tired; so every one
slept tranquilly until the stewardess,
rushing into the ladies’ cabin, announced
that we had passed the
Kish light some time, and should
be “in” in half an hour.</p>

<p>Without conveying any meaning
to an English lady close by, the
word quickly roused me; for it was
full of memories&mdash;sad, yet happy.
Many and many an evening, when
living once on the Wicklow shore,
had I sat watching on the far horizon
the sparkling light which
marked the well-known light-ship
nine miles off the Irish coast. Of
a summer’s night it shone like a
twinkling star, suggestive of cool,
refreshing breezes far away upon
the calm waters, when perchance a
hot breeze hung heavily over the
land; but in winter the simple
knowledge of its existence, with two
men living there on board in a solitude
that was broken only once a
month, while the winds and waves
raged fiercely around the ship, often
haunted my dreams and made the
stormy nights doubly dreary all
along the Wicklow sea-board.</p>

<p>“The Kish light! Has not that
a delightful, pleasant home sound?”
said a middle-aged woman near,
looking at me as if she had divined
my thoughts. “And these boats&mdash;there
are no others to be compared
to them! The English have
no excuse for not coming to Ireland,”
she continued, “with vessels
of this kind, that are like true
floating bridges, so steady, swift,
and large. Who could be ill in
them? No one!”</p>

<p>I was puzzled to think who she
could be; for though the face was not
unfamiliar, I could give it no name.
It was that of a lady, certainly,
with a bright, intelligent, happy expression;
but I saw that her garb
was coarse as she bent and rummaged
for something in her bag.
In a moment, however, the mystery
was solved by her lightly throwing
a snow-white piece of linen
over her head, which, as if by
magic, took the form of the cornet
of a Sister of S. Vincent de Paul.</p>

<p>“Sister Mary!” I exclaimed,
“whom I knew at Constantinople!”</p>

<p>“The same,” she answered. “I
thought I knew you!” And shaking
hands cordially, we sat down to
talk over the past.</p>

<p>She was a native of Ireland&mdash;her
accent alone betrayed her, though
she had not seen her native land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_767" id="Page_767">[767]</a></span>
for years&mdash;and I had known her in
the East, after which she had been
to Algiers and various other parts.
Now, to her great joy, she had been
ordered for a while to one of the
convents of the order in Dublin&mdash;a
joy which, though she tried, nun-like,
to subdue it, burst forth uncontrollably
the nearer we approached
the land. Coming with me on
deck to watch our entrance into
Kingstown Harbor, the first person
we met was Harry West, who eyed
my companion with amazement;
for he had never seen a Sister
of Charity in living form before,
though he entertained that sort
of romantic admiration for them
which the most rigid Protestants
often accord to this order, though
they deny it to every other. Turning
round again, my surprise was
great at encountering the Bishop&mdash;the
<em>Catholic</em> Bishop&mdash;of &mdash;&mdash;shire,
on his way to the consecration of a
church in the far west of Ireland.
“Quelle heureuse rencontre!” said
his lordship playfully; for we were
very old friends. “You see I am attracted
also to the <em>dear</em> old country!
You smile,” he continued,
noticing my amused expression
as I introduced Harry to him.
“Oh! yes, I know I am a Saxon,
<i lang="fr">pur sang</i>. But we English bishops
and priests always feel as if we
were at home the instant we put
our foot on shore in the Green
Isle. There’s Kingstown and its
church, where I shall go to say
Mass the moment we land. Watch,
now!” he added, as we drew up
alongside the jetty; “you’ll see
how civil the men will be the instant
they perceive I am a bishop.”
As he spoke a porter rushed by,
and an impulse seized me to give
him a hint to this effect. At once
the man knelt down, in all his hurry,
“for his lordship’s blessing;” nor
did he limit his attentions to this,
but insisted on carrying his luggage,
not only on shore, but up to
the hotel, refusing, as the bishop
later told us, to accept a penny for
his time and trouble&mdash;“the honor
of serving his lordship and of getting
his blessing was quite reward
enough!”</p>

<p>Harry, standing by, could not
believe his eyes. It was a phase
of life quite unknown to him. But
there was no time for meditation;
the train was on the pier, the whistle
sounded, and we were soon on
the road to Dublin.</p>

<p>It was Sunday&mdash;the one day of
all others which, had I wished to
show Harry the difference between
the two countries, I should have
purposely chosen; the one morning
in the week when Dublin is astir
from early dawn, and London, on
the other hand, sleeps. Residents
in the latter, Catholic residents especially,
are painfully aware of the
difficulty of finding cab or conveyance
of any kind to take them to
early Mass, and know how, in the
finest summer weather, they may
wander through the parks without
meeting a human being until the
afternoon. In England church-going
commences, properly speaking,
at eleven o’clock only, and
then chiefly for the upper classes;
the evening services, on the contrary,
are largely attended by the
servants and trades-people, to meet
which custom a vast majority of
families dine on cold viands, or
even relinquish the meal altogether,
substituting tea, with cold meat&mdash;or
“heavy tea,” as it is generally
called&mdash;for the ordinary social gathering.
In Ireland, as in every
Catholic country, the whole system
is reversed, as the natural consequence
of the church discipline,
which enjoins the hearing of Mass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_768" id="Page_768">[768]</a></span>
on the whole community, high and
low; and&mdash;contrary to the Protestant
system&mdash;once this obligation
fulfilled, the attendance at evening
service is necessarily much smaller.
Harry never having even been out
of England, except for a “run up
the Rhine” some years before, and
knowing no Catholic but myself, it
never occurred to him to think of
these distinctions, nor to suppose
that he would find anything in Ireland
different from English ways,
except that unlimited lawlessness
the existence of which he believed
made life so impossible there.</p>

<p>He was in the process of recovering
from his astonishment at the
unfamiliar phraseology of the Westland
Row railway porters when our
passage to the cab was impeded by
a crowd suddenly rushing along
the footway, met by an advancing
one from the opposite direction,
composed of the very poorest class,
men, women, and children. Harry’s
lively imagination and preconceived
ideas led him at once to
conclude that it must be a Fenian
Hyde Park mob <i lang="fr">renforcé</i>; and the
bewildered horror of his countenance
at thus finding his worst
fears realized the instant he arrived
at the Dublin terminus was
beyond all description comic.</p>

<p>“Ah! sure, your honor, it’s the
seven o’clock Mass that’s just over,
and the half-past seven that is going
to begin,” explained the cabman,
pointing to the large church which
stands at Westland Row adjoining
the railway station. “Sure, this
goes on every half-hour until one
o’clock. An’t we all obliged to hear
Mass, whatever else we do?” And
as we proceeded, I cross-questioned
him for the benefit of my
cousin. We discovered that this same
man had been to church at six
o’clock that morning, belonged to
a confraternity, approached the sacraments
regularly, and performed
various acts of charity in sickness
and distress amongst his fellow-members,
in accordance with the
rules of the said society; yet he was
but poorly clad, and showed no outward
signs of the remarkable intelligence
with which he answered me on
every point.</p>

<p>As usual on these occasions, the
choice of a hotel had been puzzling,
the Shelbourne, Morrison’s, Maple’s,
each having their distinctive advantages;
but at last we decided
in favor of the Imperial, a quiet
but comfortable establishment facing
the General Post-Office in
Sackville Street. The streets were
alive with people as we crossed Carlisle
Bridge, past Smith O’Brien’s
white marble statue; and Harry
could not help noticing the contrast
to England at that early Sunday
hour.</p>

<p>Refreshed by our ablutions and
clean toilets, we were comfortably
seated at breakfast, when sounds of
music approaching caused us to
rush to the window, and showed
us a wagonette full of musicians
in green uniform, playing “Garry
Owen” and “Patrick’s Day,” followed
by half a dozen outside cars
full of men and women.</p>

<p>“Fenians!” cried Harry. “I
told you I could not be mistaken.”</p>

<p>“Only some trade guild going out
for an innocent day’s pleasure in the
country; after having been to Mass
too, I have no doubt,” observed a
gentleman close by, whose accent
was unmistakably English. “This
is not the only custom that will seem
new to you, if you are strangers,”
he continued, addressing Harry, and
smiling meanwhile. “No two countries
ever were more different than
England and Ireland. I shall never
forget my astonishment on arriving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_769" id="Page_769">[769]</a></span>
here two years ago. I could not
get accustomed to it at all at first.
I remember one circumstance particularly
which greatly struck me.
I arrived on a Sunday morning, as
you have done, and taking up the
<cite>Freeman’s Journal</cite>&mdash;one of the best
Dublin papers&mdash;on Monday, perceived
a short paragraph in a corner,
headed, ‘A Bishop Killed,’ so small
that it might easily have escaped
notice. Nor was there any allusion
to it in any other part of the paper;
but, reading on, you may conceive
my surprise at finding that ‘a
bishop’ was no one less than the
Bishop of Winchester, <em>the</em> leading
bishop in England, whose death
by a fall from his horse, you will remember,
convulsed that country
through its length and breadth.
Not one of my acquaintances even&mdash;and
I had many in Dublin&mdash;took
the smallest interest in it. They had
not followed his career; he had not
the slightest influence in Ireland;
and few knew his name, or that he
was any relation to the great Wilberforce.
On the other hand, they
were at the time living upon news
from the North, where a police officer
was on his trial for the murder
of a bank manager&mdash;a fact which no
one in England gave the smallest
heed to. I had never heard of it.
But that same afternoon the head
waiter of the hotel, unable to conceal
his excitement, came up and
whispered to me, ‘He is condemned,
sir! I have got a telegram from
Omagh myself this instant.’ I had
only been thirty-six hours in Ireland
at the time, and, having merely
glanced at the newspaper, knew
nothing of the trial; so I was electrified
and mystified beyond measure,
and had no remedy but to sit
down and study it. I then discovered
it was deeply interesting from
its bearing upon all classes, and I
could not resist writing to some of
the English papers and endeavoring
to excite them on the subject.
But it would not do! No paper
inserted my letter. The similarity
of interest is not kept up continuously
between the two countries,
owing very much, I think, to
the little interchange of newspapers
between them. I hope you
have ordered your <cite>Times</cite> to be forwarded,
sir,” he continued; “for
you can’t expect to find one to buy
in Dublin. They’ll always give
you the <cite>Irish Times</cite>, if you merely
ask for the <cite>Times</cite>; they never think
about the latter&mdash;far less than on
the Continent.”</p>

<p>This was a dreadful blow to
Harry; for, like all Englishmen, he
could not exist without his <cite>Times</cite>
at breakfast, and, though I proposed
that he should write for it by that
night’s mail, his reviving spirits
were sadly checked by the feeling
of being in a land which apparently
did not believe in <em>his</em> guide and
vade-mecum. I felt it would be
heartless under such circumstances
to leave him alone; yet, I should go
to Mass. At length, not liking to
let me wander by myself in “such
a dangerous city,” he offered to accompany
me and give up his own
service for the day. A little curiosity,
I thought, lurked beneath the
kindness; but if so, it was amply
rewarded.</p>

<p>Following the porter’s direction
of “first to the right and then to
the left,” we soon reached the handsome
church in Marlborough Street,
opposite the National Schools.
As at Westland Row, so here an
immense crowd was pouring out,
but a far larger one pushing in; so
that, although long before twelve
o’clock, we considered ourselves
fortunate in getting any places whatever.
Unaware that this was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_770" id="Page_770">[770]</a></span>
cathedral, and without any expectations
regarding it in consequence,
our surprise was great when a long
procession moved up the centre,
closed by His Eminence Cardinal
Cullen, in full pontificals, blessing
us as he passed. “Those are the
canons who attend on all great
occasions, and the young men are
the students at Clonliffe Seminary,”
whispered a young woman next me
in answer to my inquiries, while
his eminence was taking his seat
on the throne, to Harry’s infinite
edification. “And we shall have a
sermon from Father Burke after
Mass,” she continued&mdash;“‘our
Prince of Preachers,’ as the cardinal
calls him. I came here more
than an hour ago, in order to get a
place. I promise you it’ll be worth
hearing. Oh! there’s no one like
him. God bless him!”</p>

<p>And as she said, so it happened.
The instant Mass was over, not
before, the famous Dominican was
seen ascending the pulpit. The
centre of the church was filled with
benches, and a standing mass in the
passage between, while the aisles
were so packed by the poorest
classes that a pin could not be
dropped amongst them. Of that
vast multitude not one individual
had stirred, and in a few seconds
they hung with rapt attention upon
every word spoken by the gifted
preacher. By their countenances
it was easy to see how they followed
all his arguments, drank in every
sentiment, and&mdash;who could wonder
at it?&mdash;were entranced by his lofty
accents. Harry himself was mesmerized.
The subject was charity,
and the cause an appeal for schools
under Sisters of Charity. In all
his experience of English preachers&mdash;and
it was varied&mdash;Harry confessed
that he had never heard anything
like this. Whether for sublime
language, beautiful, delicate action,
pathetic tone, quotations from Scripture
Old and New, or eloquence of
appeal, he considered it unrivalled.
It lasted an hour, but seemed not
five minutes. As we passed out of
the door, the plates were filled with
piles of those one-pound notes which
in Ireland represent the gold. I saw
Harry’s hand glide almost unconsciously
into his pockets, and beheld
a sovereign fall noiselessly amongst
the paper.</p>

<p>“One certainly is the better of a
fine sermon,” he remarked, as we
sauntered back to the hotel; “and
I never heard a finer. Altogether,
it was a remarkable sight, and the
people looked mild enough. But
we must not trust to appearances
nor be deceived too easily, you
know,” he added after a few moments.</p>

<p>I knew nothing of the kind, but
thought the best reply would be a
proposal to follow the multitude
who were now crowding the tram-carriages
that start from Nelson’s
Pillar to all the suburbs. “In half
an hour the streets will be deserted
until evening,” said our English
acquaintance, whom we again met
accidentally, and who recommended
a walk on the pier at Kingstown
as the least fatiguing trip, volunteering,
moreover, to accompany us
part of the way, as he was going to
visit friends on that line at the
“Rock,” as Blackrock is usually
called. It was contrary to Harry’s
customs on the “Sabbath”; yet,
after all the church-going he had
seen that morning, he could not deny
that air and exercise were most legitimate.
Accordingly, entering a
crowded train to Westland Row, we
soon found ourselves retracing the
route we came a few hours before.</p>

<p>Most truly has it been said that
no city has more varied or beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_771" id="Page_771">[771]</a></span>
suburbs than Dublin, and no
population which so much enjoy
them. Hitherto we had seen few
but the lower and middle classes;
for the wealthier side of Dublin is
south of the Liffey. Moreover, being
autumn, the “fashionables”
were not in town. They were
either travelling on the Continent
or scattered in the vicinity. The
train, however, was full of smart
dresses and bright faces, “wreathed
in smiles” and brimming over with
merriment. Every one, too, seemed
more or less to know every one
else, and even our English friend
was acquainted with many. “That
is Judge Keogh,” he said, as he
bowed to a short, square-built man
waiting on the platform near us&mdash;“Keogh,
of the celebrated Galway
judgment&mdash;a man of first-rate
talent, as you may guess from his
broad forehead and long head; but
he has ruined himself by his violence
on that occasion. He is
quite ‘broken’ since then, and his
spirits gone; for he knows what his
fellow-countrymen think of him,
and he rarely appears in public except
upon the bench. He is probably
going to Bray now, where he is
spending the summer quietly and
unnoticed. And that is Judge
Monahan getting into the next
carriage with those ladies&mdash;he who
presided at the Yelverton trial;
also of great legal capacity and a
most kindly, tender-hearted man,
always surrounded by his children
and grandchildren. Sir Dominic
Corrigan, the eminent physician, is
in that corner yonder; his fame
has doubtless reached you too,” he
continued, addressing Harry, who
had been contemplating the two
legal celebrities, well known to him
through his oracle, the <cite>Times</cite>, which,
from their connection with the
above-named events, had noticed
them on both occasions. “I could
point out many others, if I could
escort you to Kingstown”; but as
we halted at the Blackrock Station
a smart carriage was awaiting and
carried him off inland, whilst we
dashed onwards, the blue waters of
Dublin Bay, bounded by the hill of
Howth, on our left, and rows of
terraces and pretty villas along the
shore on our right.</p>

<p>It was a bright afternoon, with a
cool, refreshing breeze, and the pier
was one gay mass of pedestrians.
The whole of Dublin might have
been there, so great was the gathering;
but we afterwards found that
every other side of the capital was
equally frequented. Fully an English
mile in length, it is of substantial
masonry, which on the outer
side slopes by large blocks of granite
into the sea, while a broad road
skirts the inner line next to the harbor,
terminated by a lighthouse at
the extreme point. Old and young
were here congregated; children
playing amongst the granite rocks;
clerks and shop-girls, mixed with
whole families of the professional
classes of the capital, perambulating
in groups, dressed in their prettiest
and brightest, looking the very
pictures of enjoyment and friendly
intercourse. A man-of-war was anchored
in the harbor, which was
also full of graceful yachts and
alive with boating parties rowing
about in all directions. A more
healthful, innocent afternoon it were
difficult to conceive, and even
Harry admitted the general <i lang="it">brio</i>
which seemed to pervade the air.
Nor could he any longer deny the
proverbial beauty of the Dublin
maidens; and I found him quite
ready to linger on a seat and watch
the clear complexions and faultless
features that passed in such constant
succession before us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_772" id="Page_772">[772]</a></span></p>

<p>After some time that tinge of
melancholy common to strangers
in a crowd began imperceptibly to
steal over us, as we awoke to the
recollection that we alone seemed
without acquaintances in that
throng, and we moved to the station
on our way Dublin-ward.
Suddenly the one defect to us was
repaired; for on the platform we
found the Bishop of &mdash;&mdash;shire going
to Dalkey to dine with some
old friends. Harry had made rapid
strides since the morning; for his
face brightened as he recognized
our fellow-passenger, and the next
moment, undisguisedly admitting
that he had spent a charming day,
he dwelt with earnestness on the
splendid sermon of the morning.</p>

<p>“Oh! yes,” observed a priest
who accompanied his lordship,
“even a Protestant clergyman told
me lately that he considered the
only orators in the true sense
of the word now in the United
Kingdom to be Gladstone, Bright,
and Father Burke. But Father
Burke has something more than
mere oratory,” said he, smiling.
“You ought to hear him at his
own church in Dominic Street, where
he is to preach again to-night.
He is more at home there than
anywhere else. If you want a real
treat in the matter of preaching, I
recommend you to go there.”</p>

<p>The remark was dropped at random;
but, to my excessive surprise,
Harry caught fire, and, finding me
willing, he hurried through his dinner
in a manner that was perfectly
astounding. Then, in feverish haste,
we made our way to S. Saviour’s.
It was not yet eight o’clock, but
still the church was so full that
entrance was quite impossible.
There was no standing room even,
said those at the door, and we were
turning away, to Harry’s deep disappointment,
when a beggar-woman
accosted us with “Won’t your
honor give me something for a cup
of tea? Sure, I dreamt last night
that your honor would give me a
pound of tea and her ladyship a
pound of sugar. Ye were the very
faces I saw in my drame. And may
God reward ye!”</p>

<p>“Dreams go by contraries,” replied
Harry testily, so vexed at
missing the sermon that he was in
no humor to be teased.</p>

<p>“Indeed! then, that’s just it,”
answered the woman, an arch wink
lighting up her wizened features.
“It’s just your honor, then, that’s to
give me the sugar and her ladyship
the tea; so it’ll be good luck for
me anyhow! And may God bless
you and his holy Mother watch
over you!” she continued, as Harry,
unable to resist a hearty laugh
at the woman’s readiness, drew out
his purse and handed her a shilling.
“And now, sure, I’ll show
ye how to get in to hear his riverence!
There’s no one all the world
over like Father Burke!&mdash;the darlin’.
It would be a sin for you to
go away without hearing him; so
I’ll bring ye round to the sacristy
door, and you’ll get in quite comfortable!”</p>

<p>“You must be very much at
home here, if you can manage
that,” observed Harry, amused at
the whole performance, as we meekly
followed our tattered guide.</p>

<p>“Oh! then, don’t I spend half
my time in the church, your honor!
A poor body like me can’t work;
but sure an’ can’t I pray? I hear
three Masses every Sunday and
one every week-day. Sure, it’d be
a sin if I didn’t. Oh! I don’t
mane it’d be a sin on week-days,
but it’d be a mortal sin if I didn’t
hear one on Sundays. Sure, every
one knows that!” …</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_773" id="Page_773">[773]</a></span></p>

<p>This was, however, precisely the
kind of knowledge in which Harry
was utterly deficient. Mortal sin
and venial sin were to him, as to
most Englishmen, unknown terms,
and he gaped with bewilderment as
this ragged woman proceeded to
develop to him the difference in the
clearest possible language. There
is no saying to what length the
catechetical instruction might have
extended, if we had not reached
the sacristy door, where, true
enough, the clerk, noticing we
were strangers, led us into reserved
seats beside the sanctuary, though
even there but scant room then remained.</p>

<p>S. Saviour’s, built by the Dominicans
within the last fifteen years, is
an excellent specimen of Gothic,
and, filled to overflowing with a
devout, earnest congregation, upon
whom brilliant gaseliers now shed
a flood of light, no sight could be
more impressive. The devotions,
so fitting in a Dominican church,
commenced with the Rosary, which
being over, the black mantle, white
robe, and striking head of the favorite
preacher rose above the pulpit
ledge. His text was again on
charity; and if anything were needed
to show his powers, the versatility
with which he treated the
same theme would have been all-sufficient.
Harry was lost in admiration,
especially as it was extempore,
in contradistinction to the
Protestant habit of <em>reading</em> sermons;
nor could he believe, on
looking at his watch, that we had
once more been listening for an
entire hour. He could have remained
there for many more quarters;
and, to judge from their countenances,
so could the whole congregation,
even to the very poorest.
Benediction followed, and, as deeply
impressed as in the morning, we
pursued our way back with the
crowd through Dominic Street into
Sackville street and to our “home”
at the Imperial Hotel.</p>

<p>Next morning Harry West was a
different man. I sought, however,
for an explanation in vain. No
<cite>Times</cite>, it is true, was forthcoming;
but then it was Monday, and in his
Buckinghamshire retreat this likewise
happened on the first day of
the week. The Irish papers doubtless
irritated him by their paucity of
English news&mdash;not even “a bishop
killed!”&mdash;and their volubility on
topics quite unfamiliar to him was
very vexatious. Still this was not
sufficient to account for the change
which had come over the spirit of
his dream. At length, by a slight
hint, I discovered that he thought
he had allowed himself to be carried
away giddily by the excitement
of the previous day, and that
he must look at matters more soberly
if he really were to be an impartial
judge. This was the day of
our departure for Westmeath, and
he would not be influenced by any
one. Our train did not leave until
three <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and I urged a ramble
through the town; but in his present
mood he viewed everything askance,
and would not even smile at the many
witticisms and pleasant answers
which I found it possible to draw
forth from the guides, porters, and
cabmen, almost unconsciously to
themselves.</p>

<p>At last we started from the Broadstone
station. The afternoon was
cloudy, and, as we advanced, the
country became dull and uninteresting.
The line ran beside a canal&mdash;on
which there seemed but poor
traffic&mdash;bordered by broad fields
of pasture, so thinly stocked with
cattle, however, and so deserted-looking,
though in the vicinity of
Dublin, that the effect was even depressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_774" id="Page_774">[774]</a></span>
upon me. Two ladies in our
compartment, certainly, noticed it
as something unusual, saying some
mysterious words about Ballinasloe
fair and how different it would be
when that event took place; but they
left the carriage immediately, so we
had no opportunity of cross-questioning
them. In the course of two
and a half hours we reached our terminus
at Athboy, and the porter,
asking if we were the friends expected
by Mrs. Connor, handed me a
note just brought from her. It explained
that one of her horses being
laid up and she likewise ailing, she
could neither come herself nor send
her carriage; she hoped, therefore,
that we might be content with the
“outside car,” a cart going at the
same time for our luggage. Content
I certainly was, for I loved the national
vehicle; but Harry had never
tried one, and in his present temper
nothing pleased him. The civility
of the coachman even provoked
him, and made him whisper something
about “blarney” in my ear.
However, putting our cloaks and
bundles in the “well,” we got up
back to back, one on each side and
the coachman on the seat in the
middle.</p>

<p>Athboy, too, known to Harry
from the debates as a focus of Ribbonism,
was an unlucky starting-point,
and the number of barefooted
though well-made, handsome children
running about its streets,
greatly shocked him.</p>

<p>Whether the coachman really
urged on the horse faster than
on subsequent occasions, or the
turnings were sharper, or that Harry
was startled by the difficulty every
novice experiences in holding on,
I have never since been able to ascertain;
but, looking around at him
in less than five minutes after we left,
his piteous expression convulsed
me with laughter. From him, however,
it met with no response, and
he either could not or would not
admire the brilliant sunset sky,
which in autumn is often so exquisite
in this part of Ireland. With
every step the road grew prettier,
thickly overshadowed by the large,
spreading trees of the beautiful gentlemen’s
seats in this district;
though here and there a wretched
roadside cabin startled Harry from
his revery, and the recurrence of a
black cross now and again on a
wall attracted his attention.</p>

<p>“O sir! that’s only where some
one was killed,” answered Dan, the
coachman, most innocently, making
Harry shudder meanwhile; though
in the same breath he added: “This
is where Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; was killed by
a fall from his horse, and the last
one was put up where poor Biddy
Whelan was thrown out of the cart
when returning from market at
Delvin two years last Michaelmas,
by the old horse shying. She
died on the spot in a few minutes,
and these crosses are painted that
way on the wall to remind us to
say a prayer for the poor souls.
God be merciful to them!”</p>

<p>Harry’s sidelong glances towards
me, however, plainly proved that he
mistrusted the man’s words and gave
them a very different meaning. By
degrees&mdash;as always does happen on
these cars, which amongst their
many advantages cannot boast their
adaptation for conversation&mdash;we
grew silent, and no one had spoken
for the next ten minutes, when we
turned down a long, straight road,
rendered still darker by the magnificent
elms which stretched across
it as in a high arch. Suddenly a
feeble shot was heard not far off,
and at the same moment Harry
jumped off the car, put his hand to
his heart, and cried out: “I’m killed!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_775" id="Page_775">[775]</a></span>
I’m killed!” What words can
express my horror? To this day
I know not how I too jumped off;
I only know that I found myself
standing beside him in an agony
of mind. Had all my vain boasting,
all my obstinacy, resulted in
this? Was poor Harry West thus to
be sacrificed to my foolhardiness?
But the agony though sharp was&mdash;must
I betray my cousin’s weakness,
and confess it?&mdash;short. I
looked for blood, for fainting, for
anything resembling my preconceived
notions of a “roadside murder”;
when, as quickly as he had jumped
off the car, so quickly he now seemed
to recover. Ashamed of himself
he certainly was, when, taking
away his hand, he was obliged to
admit “it was all a mistake!” After
all, he had never been touched!
But the shot had been so unexpected,
and he had at the time been
brooding so deeply over all the
stories he had read of “agrarian
outrages,” that he had positively
thought he had been hit; and very
natural it seemed to him, as no
doubt he had been already recognized
as a <em>land agent</em> by the Irish
population!<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Quite impossible is
it to describe my mingled feelings
of vexation at the needless fright
and of uncontrollable amusement at
my English friend’s unexampled
folly. Dan, the coachman, underwent
the same process, only in an
aggravated form; for, while he felt
indignant at the implied insult to
his countrymen, every feature in
his face betrayed the most uncontrollable
amusement, mixed with
supreme contempt; for he declared
that the shot was fired by his own
son running in search of hedge-sparrows,
as was his wont at that
hour, and he pointed him out to us
in the next field, which belonged to
Mrs. Connor. The gate of her avenue
was only a few yards further
on.</p>

<p>If I had wished to break the ice
on our arrival at Mauverstown, this
incident would effectually have accomplished
it. But the party consisted
of Mrs. Connor; her son, a
youth of twenty; Katie, a daughter of
twenty-nine, and a handsome, black-eyed,
fair-complexioned young lady,
Miss Florence O’Grady, come on a
visit “all the way from Kerry.” Poor
Harry! At a glance I saw that he
was in my power, and he gave me
such an imploring look that my lips
were sealed, in the hope of saving
him from the tender mercies of the
merry young ones. Not a word
did I say of the adventure. It was
not to be expected, however, that
Dan would show him equal mercy;
and young Connor’s roguish expression
next morning, when he came in
late to breakfast after a visit to the
stables, told me that he had heard
the story, and, moreover, that it had
lost nothing in the telling. Fortunately
Harry, who was by nature
the kindest and most amiable of
men, had thoroughly recovered his
ordinary good temper, and joined
in the laugh against himself so cordially
that the hearts of all were at
once gained. Had he by chance
done otherwise, his life would have
been made miserable; but now one
and all declared that they would only
punish him by making him acquainted
with every hedge and bush
in the country, and that he should
not leave until he “made restitution”
by singing the praises of
“ould Ireland.” Charlie Connor
would help him in the shooting,
the young ladies could take him
across country&mdash;for “cub-hunting”
had begun, though it was too early
yet for the regular hunt&mdash;while Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_776" id="Page_776">[776]</a></span>
Connor mentioned a list of gentlemen’s
places far and near which
she would show him, that he might
tell his English friends it was not
quite so barbarous a land as they
evidently imagined.</p>

<p>Good-natured though he was,
Harry’s face lengthened at a prospect
which would involve a longer
stay than he had intended; but
there was no time for reflection, for
Charlie led him off to inspect the
farm, the young ladies took him
through the pleasure-grounds on
his return, and in the afternoon we
all drove to a croquet party more
than eight miles off.</p>

<p>Henceforward most faithfully did
they carry out their resolutions,
leaving no morning or afternoon
unappropriated to some pleasure.
Of all counties in Ireland, Westmeath
is remarkable for its many
handsome seats, well-timbered parks,
and the pleasant social intercourse
maintained amongst their owners.
At this season, too, every one was
at home, and croquet parties, <i lang="fr">matinées
musicales</i>, or dinner parties
were countless. The shooting filled
a certain place in the programme
for the gentlemen, no doubt; still,
Harry, announcing that he saw
more of the country by following
the ladies, always managed to accompany
us. The gardens and
conservatories interested him, he
said; and the luxuriance of the
shrubs and evergreens always attracted
his admiration, and was an
invariable excuse for a saunter with
the young ladies, though oftener
with only one of the party. When we
had inspected those in our immediate
vicinity, a flower-show at Kells,
in the bordering county of Meath
(also under the Peace-Preservation
Act!), displayed to us in addition
the “beauty, gallantry, and fashion”
of both neighborhoods. Nothing,
perhaps, on these occasions is more
striking to a stranger than the sort
of family life which seems to exist
in Irish counties, every one knowing
the other from boyhood intimately&mdash;nay,
from generation to
generation. Above all is it remarkable
how every one can tell at
once by the family name what part
of Ireland a new-comer springs
from, or whether Celtic, of “the
Pale,” or Cromwellian, with most
unerring accuracy. The majority
of land-owners in Meath and Westmeath
belong to the latter&mdash;Cromwellian&mdash;class;
but this in no way
hinders their living on the best
terms&mdash;unlike what occurs in the
“Black North”&mdash;with their Catholic
neighbors, few and far between
though these undoubtedly are.</p>

<p>One of the prettiest and most interesting
places in this neighborhood&mdash;Ballinlough
Castle&mdash;belongs
to the descendants of the very ancient
sept of O’Reilly, although
within the present century they
have taken the name of Nugent, in
consequence of a large property
having been left to them by one of
that family. As the word implies,
it is situated on a lough, or small
lake, and the house consists of an
old building to which several large
rooms have been added within the
present century. The northwest
front is now completely covered
with ivy, thickly intermingled with
Virginia creepers, the deep-red
leaves of which amidst the dark
green of the ivy made a beautiful
picture at this autumnal season.
Embedded in the foliage, a tablet
over the door records the date,
1614&mdash;thirty-five years before the
invasion of Ireland by Cromwell.
In the dining-room are two deep
recesses, still called by the family
Cromwell’s stables; for tradition relates
that in one his horse, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_777" id="Page_777">[777]</a></span>
other his <em>cow</em>, rested during the one
night he slept in the castle. Early
on the following day he left the
place to continue his march; but
before he had proceeded far, having
repented that he had not seized so
fine a property, he sent back one
of his officers with an order to the
O’Reilly, the owner, to surrender
at once, giving the officer permission&mdash;as
was his wont on such occasions&mdash;to
take and keep the castle
for himself. Not so easy was
this, however, as they had imagined
from their previous day’s experience;
for “forewarned is forearmed,”
and the instant Cromwell
departed the house had been barricaded.
His messenger, therefore,
seen returning along the avenue,
was communicated with now only
from behind closed doors. Yet
the owner did not refuse in so many
words. He merely presented the
house-key hanging on the end of a
pistol, through an opening over the
door, desiring the man to seize it if
he dared! Not of a daring character,
however, was the officer, and
he took a few moments to consider;
then, throwing a <em>would-be</em> contemptuous
look at the coveted house and
land, he turned away, was soon out
of sight, and no Cromwell or Cromwellian
ever troubled Ballinlough
again.</p>

<p>The castle contains, besides some
most beautiful carvings from Spain,
Aubusson tapestries from France,
marble chimney-pieces and paintings
from Italy, collected in his
travels by Sir James Nugent some
fifty years since; also many relics
of past times&mdash;for example, one
very fine Vandyke; a full-length
portrait of Lady Thurles, widow
of the Duke of Ormond’s son, and
afterwards allied to the O’Reillys;
another, of the famous Peggy
O’Neil, only daughter of Sir Daniel
O’Neil, the hero at the battle
of the Boyne, who is said to be the
one who exclaimed when the day
was over: “Change kings, and we
will fight the battle over again.”
He then accompanied King James
to France, but, being subsequently
pardoned by William and recalled
to take possession of his estates, he
died at Calais on his road home.
King William, strange to relate, is
stated notwithstanding, in a fit of
generosity, to have given a large
dower to this his only daughter
Peggy when she soon afterwards
married Hugh O’Reilly, of Ballinlough
Castle, and thus became the
ancestress of the present family.
A satin quilt embroidered by her
hands still exists amongst the castle
treasures; but most interesting
of all the relics is an old chalice
dating from that period.</p>

<p>On our road thither we had
passed by the ruins of a small
chapel carefully preserved, standing
in a field still called Cromwell’s
field, because there the priest was
saying Mass when a scout returned
and gave the alarm that the invader
and his troops were speedily
advancing. In consternation, the
congregation fled; but the priest
neither could nor would interrupt
the Holy Sacrifice, and he had
just time to finish it when the enemy’s
soldiers appeared in sight.
Then, and then only, he took flight
across the fields; but his foot slipped
as he was crossing the nearest
hedge, and the chalice which he
held in his hand was bent by his
fall. And this same chalice, notched
and bent, we now saw carefully
preserved by the gracious <i lang="fr">Dame-Châtelaine</i>
of Ballinlough. And
here it may be noticed that similar
relics and traditions are found all
over Ireland. Another family of our
acquaintance possesses the diminutive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_778" id="Page_778">[778]</a></span>
plain chalice used by a priest
of their blood&mdash;his name being engraven
on the base&mdash;for saying
Mass behind a hedge when even
this was penal both for priest and
people. In that particular case,
too, this steadfastness to his duty
did end fatally; for this same priest
was one of those killed at Drogheda.
In the grounds of another
friend a small, thickly-wooded eminence
is shown, with a grotto which
served to shelter the priest when
officiating, whilst the congregation
knelt in groups around, with scouts
outside ready to give warning of
any unfriendly approach. Elsewhere
the “priest’s hill,” enclosed
within the demesne walls, bears its
name from the sad fate of another
of the sacred ministry killed there
whilst caught in the act of saying
Mass. Two hundred years and
more have elapsed since Cromwell’s
day, but it is no wonder that
the memory of these events is still
fresh in the minds of a faithful
posterity, or that they should delight
to speak of deeds which
would honor any people.</p>

<p>Deeply impressed as Harry West
was by traditions which until then
had been unknown to him, he was
further edified by the manner in
which the Irish poor flock from far
and near on Sunday mornings to the
parish church, often walking thither
many a long mile in hail, rain,
and snow. Sometimes it stands at
a central point, on a hill or in the
middle of a field, no village even
near; but many handsome new
churches are in course of erection
from contributions gathered chiefly
amongst the poor. Some of these
collections are wonderful, considering
the localities, seven and eight
hundred pounds&mdash;nay, a thousand&mdash;being
often the result of the “laying
the foundation-stone,” or “opening
day,” in a district solely inhabited
by farmers and peasants&mdash;especially,
be it added, if the favorite
Father Burke be the preacher.
Many and many a time, however,
large sums are sent on such occasions
back from America from
some old parishioner whose fortune
has increased since he left the
“dear ould country,” but whose
heart still clings to it faithfully and
tenderly. Most remarkable, too, is
the correspondence kept up by emigrants
with their families, and the
large presents in money “sent
home” from sons to fathers, brothers
to sisters. It was our friend’s
custom&mdash;as it is at Ballinlough Castle
and many other houses&mdash;to let
the poorer cottagers come up to the
hall-door for doles of bread, or
presents of clothes at certain seasons,
and at all times for medicine,
of which the ladies have knowledge
just sufficient for all minor wants.
One morning I was watching Mrs.
Connor’s distribution, when old
Biddy Nolan produced a letter
which she begged her honor to
read for her. The postmark was
Chicago, and it came from her son
<em>Mike</em>, who had not written since he
left home; but now he gave a full
account of his adventures, winding
up by enclosing his mother, who
was bathed in tears of joy, a draft
for twenty pounds&mdash;his savings during
the last few months!</p>

<p>Another characteristic of the
County Westmeath consists in its
many pretty lakes; and as picnics,
fishing and boating excursions, were
not forgotten in the Connor hospitalities,
these&mdash;Lough Derrevarra in
particular&mdash;could not be omitted.
The road to the lakes lay across a
bog, moor, and wild, deserted-looking
tract, the exact reverse of the
neighborhood we were living in.
Dismal enough it was returning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_779" id="Page_779">[779]</a></span>
sometimes in the dark without meeting
a human being perhaps for
miles, and difficult to me now and
then to resist a shudder. Strange,
however, is the world, and in nothing
did it appear to me stranger
than in Harry West’s air of tranquillity
and perfect security.</p>

<p>He never dreamt of jumping off
of the car (he would have left a
pretty neighbor if he had!), nor
seemed to remember the existence
of the police, Ribbonmen, or Peace-Preservation
Act! He heard no
one mention them, and he had given
up thinking about them.</p>

<p>Truly, a second change had
come over the spirit of his dream.
And in proportion to his aversion
to my Irish visit, so now he was
the one that experienced difficulty
in ending it. Not days but weeks
passed by; yet there he lingered, to
the inconceivable surprise of his
friends at home. Not to mine,
however. The cause was patent to
every one on the spot; nor could I
wonder when, one morning, throwing
off his customary reserve, he
asked me to welcome as a cousin
his Irish <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>, the beautiful Florence
O’Grady. Short had been
the wooing, he said, but none the
less thorough his conversion. A
curious mixture of love and religion
those outside-car excursions
must certainly have been (these
two never would avail themselves
of carriage or other vehicle); for
not only had she conquered his
Saxon, but even his religious prejudices
so fully that he voluntarily
offered to place himself at once
under some able teacher.</p>

<p>Christmas was not long in coming
round under these circumstances,
nor Harry West in returning
as a Catholic to claim his Kerry
bride, blessing me for having accepted
his escort, whilst I regarded
the event as a reward for that act
of self-denial on his part. Nor
could he, at the joyous wedding
breakfast, resist describing the scene
of his leap from the car on the evening
of his arrival, giving a cheer
at the same time for the Peace-Preservation
Act, which, to him
at least&mdash;although only from the
terror it had inspired&mdash;had been
the primary cause of so much happiness.</p>

<h3>THE LEGEND OF FRIAR’S ROCK.</h3>

<p>The thing long hoped for had
come to pass (though, alas! by
what a way of grief) and I was visiting
my school friend, Anne d’Estaing,
in Bretagne. It was six years
since we had met, but we had kept
up a constant correspondence; and
by letter when absent, as well as
by word when together, I had become
so familiar with her home
and her family that I did not go
there as a stranger.</p>

<p>They lived in an old castle partly
fallen into picturesque decay.
In the eastern tower was a small
chapel, which they had put into
complete repair, and there daily
they had service, and Anne found
her great delight in decking the altar
with flowers, and keeping everything
in exquisite order and neatness with
her own hands. They had had
great sorrows in the six years of our
separation. Only Anne and her
parents were left of the loving family
that once numbered eleven. Two
of the sons fell in battle, a contagious
disease swept off the three
youngest children in one week;
Anne’s favorite brother Bertrand
became a missionary priest, and
went to China under a vow never
to return; and her twin sister faded
away in consumption.</p>

<p>It had seemed to me, in my Irish
home, as if such sorrows could
scarcely be borne; but I had never
been able to come to my friend
with visible, face-to-face, heart-to-heart
consolation, for my daily duty
was beside a couch where my precious
mother lay, suffering from an
incurable disease. When her long
trouble was at last over my strength
and spirits were much shattered,
and I longed to accept Anne’s
pressing invitation. My father was
very unwilling that I should go&mdash;he
thought it would be so sad and
dreary there; but Anne’s letters
had revealed to me such a life of
peace and prayer and happy service
that it seemed to me that Château
d’Estaing must be a very haven
of rest.</p>

<p>And so I found it. From the
moment that I looked on Anne’s
pale but placid face; from the time
that her mother’s arms held me as
those other arms, which I had missed
so sorely, used to do; from the
first words of fatherly welcome
that the old count gave me, I was
at home and at peace. And when
at sunset I went to Vespers, and
the dying light shone in through
the lancet windows, along the aisle,
and on the richly-decorated altar,
and Anne’s voice and fingers led
the soothing <cite>Nunc Dimittis</cite>, it was
as if the dews of healing fell on
my bruised heart.</p>

<p>They made no stranger of me;
they knew too well what sorrow was,
and how its sting for them had been
withdrawn. So together, in the
early dawn, we knelt for the holiest
service, beginning the day in close
intercourse with Him whose “compassions
fail not,” and finding that
they are indeed “new every morning.”
Together we kept the Hours,
and did plain household duties, and
visited in the village, dispensing
medicines, reading to old women,
caring for the sick. Two afternoons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_781" id="Page_781">[781]</a></span>
in the week classes came to the castle
for instruction; every Wednesday
evening the children came to practise
the church music&mdash;and, oh!
how sweet that music was; and on
one afternoon we used to mount our
shaggy ponies and ride to a distant
hamlet, to teach the children there.
Together we took care of the garden,
where grew the flowers for the
altar and for weddings and funerals;
and of the trellis of rare grapes,
from which came the sacramental
wine. Every pleasant day we went
out upon the bay in Anne’s boat,
rowed by two strong-armed Breton
girls, visiting the rocky coves and
inlets, startling the sea-fowl from
their nests, and enjoying the sea-breeze
and crisp waves.</p>

<p>Where the bay and the sea join
is a headland, which commands the
finest view for miles around; yet,
much as we loved that view, we
were oftenest to be found at the
base, where we sat idly, while the
boat rocked on the water, which
lapped with lulling sound against
the rock. It was a pretty sight, the
face of that cliff, where wild vines
crept and delicate wild flowers
bloomed, and an aromatic odor rose
from the herbs that grew there,
and some small, weather-beaten firs
found footing in the crevices. On
the summit were a few ruins. But
the chief natural point of interest,
and that from which the Head derived
its name, was a curious rock
which stood at its base. It was
called the Friar. At first I saw little
about it which could lay claim
to such a name; but the more I
watched it, the more the likeness
grew upon me, till it became at
times quite startling. It was a massive
stone, some thirty feet above
the water at low tide, like a human
figure wrapped in a monk’s robe,
always facing the east, and always
like one absorbed in prayer and
meditation, yet ever keeping guard.
One day I asked Anne if there was
not some legend about it, and she
replied that the country people had
one which was very interesting, and
partly founded on fact. Of course
I begged for it, and she was ready
to tell me.</p>

<p>As I write, I seem to see and
hear it all again&mdash;the rocking boat;
the two girls resting on their oars
and talking in their broad <i lang="fr">patois</i>;
the twittering, darting birds; the
butterfly that fluttered round us;
the solemn rock casting its long
shadow on the water, that glittered
in the light of a summer afternoon;
Anne’s pale, thin, sparkling face,
and earnest voice. I see even the
children at play upon the shore,
acting out the old Breton superstition
of the washerwomen of the
night, who wash the shrouds of the
dead; and their quaint song mingles
with Anne’s story:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Si chrétien ne vient nous sauver,</div>
<div class="verse">Jusqu’au jugement faut laver;</div>
<div class="verse">Au clair de la lune, au bruit du vent,</div>
<div class="verse">Sous la neige, le linceul blanc;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the little bare feet are dancing
through the water, and the little
brown hands wash and wring the
sea-kale for the shrouds, and it all
seems as yesterday to me. But it
was years and years ago.</p>

<p>“You know that this is a very
dangerous coast,” Anne said.
“The tide runs fast here, and the
rocks are jagged and dangerous.
Row out a few strokes, Tiphaine
and Alix, and let Mlle. Darcy see
what happens.”</p>

<p>A dozen strokes of the oars, and
we were in an eddy where it took
all the strength of our rowers to
keep back the boat; and beyond
Friar’s Rock the tide-race was like
a whirlpool, one eddy fighting with
another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_782" id="Page_782">[782]</a></span></p>

<p>“We would not dare go further,”
Anne said. “No row-boats venture
there, and large sailing-vessels
need a cautious helmsman. In a
storm it is frightful, and the men
and the boats are not few that have
gone down there. But never a
board or a corpse has been found
afterwards. There is a swift under-current
that sweeps them out
to sea. Now, Tiphaine, row back
again.”</p>

<p>A white, modern lighthouse
stands on a rock on the outer
shore; its lantern was visible above
the Head. Anne pointed to it.</p>

<p>“That has been there only a century,”
she said. “Before it we
had another and a better light, we
Bretons. Where those ruins are,
Joanne dear, there was a small
chapel once, and on the plain below
the Head was a monastery. It was
founded hundreds of years ago, by
S. Sampson some say, and others
by the Saxon S. Dunstan himself,
or, as they call him here, S. Gonstan,
the patron of mariners. I do
not know how long it had been in
existence at the time of the legend,
but long enough to have become
famous, quite large in numbers, and
a blessing to the country round
about. The monks were the physicians
of the place; they knew every
herb, and distilled potions from
them, which they administered to
the sick, so that they came to the
beds of poverty and pain with healing
for soul and body both. They
taught the children; they settled
quarrels and disputes; on Rogation
days they led the devout procession
from field to field, marking boundary
lines, and praying or chanting
praises at every wayside cross.</p>

<p>“But that which was their special
work was the guarding of this
coast. Instead of that staring
white lighthouse, there was on the
top of the chapel’s square tower a
large lantern surmounted by a cross,
and all through the night the monks
kept it burning, and many a ship
was saved and many a life preserved
by this means. At Vespers the
lamp was lighted, and one monk
tended it from then till Nocturns,
giving his unoccupied time to prayer
for all at sea, both as to their
bodily and spiritual wants, and to
every one in any need or temptation
that night. At Nocturns he
was relieved by another monk, who
kept watch till Prime. Such for
three centuries had been the custom,
and never had the light been
known to fail.</p>

<p>“It must have been a strange
sight&mdash;that band of men in gown
and cowl engaged in the never-omitted
devotions before the altar,
then departing silently, leaving one
alone to wrestle in prayer for the
tried souls that knew little of the
hours thus spent for them. O
Joanne! what would I not give to
have it here again; to know that
this was once more the Holy Cape,
as it used to be called; and that
here no hour went by, however it
might be elsewhere, that prayers
and praises were not being offered
to our dear Lord, who ever intercedes
for us!”</p>

<p>Anne was silent for a while, and
I felt sure that she was praying.
When she roused herself, it was to
bid the rowers pull home fast, as it
was almost time for Vespers.</p>

<p>“You shall hear the rest, dear,”
she said, “when we go up-stairs to-night.”
So after Compline, and after
Anne and I had played and
sung to her parents, as we were
wont to do, she came into my
room and lighted the fire and the
tall candles, and we settled ourselves
for a real school-girl talk.
Anne showed me a sketch which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_783" id="Page_783">[783]</a></span>
her brother Bertrand had made,
partly from fancy, and partly from
the ruins, of the monastery and
chapel.</p>

<p>“It looks like a place of peace
and holiness, where one might be
safe from sin for ever,” I said; but
Anne shook her head.</p>

<p>“The old delusion,” she sighed.
“As if Satan would not spread sore
temptations just in such abodes as
these. Don’t you remember how
often we have spoken of it&mdash;the
terrible strength and subtlety of
spiritual temptations, simply because
they are less obvious than
others? The legend of the Friar
witnesses to that, whether you take
the story as true or false. I am
going to give myself a treat to-night,
and I am sure it will be one
to you. Bertrand wrote out the
legend after he made the sketch.
Will you care to hear it?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I would,” I answered;
and Anne unfolded her precious
paper.</p>

<p>“It is only a fragment,” she said,
“beginning abruptly where I left
off this afternoon; but perhaps it
will show you more of what Bertrand
is.”</p>

<p>“Anne,” I asked suddenly, “don’t
you miss him&mdash;more than any of
the others?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;yes,” she answered, then
paused thoughtfully. “Yes,” she
said at last, “I suppose I do. Because,
so long as I know he is living
somewhere on this earth, it
seems possible for my feet to go to
him and my eyes to see his face.
But, after all, none of them seem
far away. We are brought so
near in the great Communion, in
prayers&mdash;<em>in everything</em>. In fact, Joanne&mdash;does
it seem very cold-hearted?&mdash;oftenest
I do not miss them
at all; God so makes up for every
loss.”</p>

<p>I was crying by this time, for
my heartache was constant; and
Anne came and kissed me, and
looked distressed. “I ought not
to trouble you,” she said. “Did
I? I did not mean to hurt you.”</p>

<p>“Oh! no,” I answered. “Only
why should I not be as resigned as
you?”</p>

<p>“Joanne darling!” she exclaimed,
“you are <em>that</em> much more than
I am. Can’t you see? You feel&mdash;God
causes you to feel it&mdash;keenly.
That is your great cross; and so,
when you do not murmur, but say,
‘God’s will be done,’ you are resigned.
But that is not the cross
he gives to me. Instead, he
makes bereavement light to me by
choosing to reveal his mercies;
and I must take great care to correspond
to his grace. Bertrand
warned me solemnly of that. And
yet this is not all I mean. Perhaps
you will understand better
when you have heard the legend.”</p>

<p>She sat on the floor close beside
me, and held my hand. I thanked
God for her, she comforted me so.
I was always hungry then for visible
love; but by degrees, and partly
through her, he taught me to be
content with a love that is invisible.</p>

<p>“There was once a monk,” she
read, “the youngest of the brotherhood,
who was left to keep the
watch from midnight until dawn.
Through the windows the moonbeams
fell, mingling with the light
that burned before the tabernacle,
and with the gleam of the monk’s
small taper. Outside, the sea was
smooth like glass, and the stars
shone brightly, and a long line of
glory stretched from shore to shore.
Lost in supplication, the monk lay
prostrate before the altar. His
thoughts and prayers were wandering
far away&mdash;to the sick upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_784" id="Page_784">[784]</a></span>
their beds of pain, to travellers on
land and sea, to mourners sunk in
loneliness or in despair, to the poor
who had no helper, to little children,
to the dying; most of all, to
the tempted, wherever they might
be.</p>

<p>“He was intensely earnest, and
he had a loving temperament and
a strong imagination which had
found fitting curb and training in
the devout practice of meditation.
The prayers he used were no mere
form to him; he seemed actually to
behold those for whom he interceded,
actually to feel their needs
and sore distress. This was nothing
new, but to-night the power of
realization came upon him as never
before. He saw the dying in their
final anguish; he suffered with the
suffering, and felt keen temptations
to many a deed of evil, and marked
Satan’s messengers going up
and down upon the earth, seeking
to capture souls. Sharper than all
else was the conflict he underwent
with doubts quite new to him&mdash;doubts
of the use or power of his
prayers. Still he prayed on, in
spite of the keen sense of unworthiness
to pray. He would not give
place for a moment to the suggestion
that his prayers were powerless.
Again and again he fortified
himself with the Name of all-prevailing
might. And then it seemed
to him, in the dim candle-light and
among the pale moonbeams, that
the Form upon the crucifix opened
its eyes and smiled at him, and that
from the lips came a voice saying,
‘Whatsoever ye shall ask in my
name, that will I do.’</p>

<p>“The hour came to tend the
light; he knew it. But he knew,
too, that the sea without was calm,
even like the crystal sea before the
Throne, save where the wild currents
that never rested were surging
white with foam and uttering hoarse
murmurs. He knew that the night
was marvellously still; that there
was no wind, not even enough to
stir the lightest leaf. What mariner
could err, even though for once
the light of the monks grew dim&mdash;nay,
even if it failed? Could he
leave that glorious vision, in order
to trim a lantern of which there
was no need; or cease his prayers
for perishing souls, in order to give
needless help to bodies able to protect
themselves? These thoughts
swept through his mind, and his
choice was hastily made to remain
before the altar; and even as he
made it the vision faded, yet with
it, or with his decision, all temptation
to doubt vanished too. If devils
had been working upon him to
cause him to cease from intercession,
they left him quite free now
to pray&mdash;with words, too, of such
seeming power as he had never
used before.</p>

<p>“Suddenly a sound smote upon
his ear&mdash;such a sound as might well
ring on in one’s brain for a lifetime,
and which he was to hear above
all earthly clamor until all earthly
clamor should cease. It was the
cry of strong men who meet death
on a sudden, utterly unprepared;
the crash of timbers against a rock;
the groan of a ship splitting from
side to side. He sprang to his feet
and rushed to the door. Already
the great bell of the monastery was
tolling, and dark, cowled figures
were hastening to the shore. He
looked up. In the cross-topped
tower, for the first time in man’s
knowledge, the lamp of the monks
was out. Just then the prior hurried
by him and up the stairs, and
soon, but all too late, the beacon
blazed again.</p>

<p>“With an awful dread upon his
heart he made his way to the coast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_785" id="Page_785">[785]</a></span>
The water foamed unbroken by
aught save rocks; but pallid lips
told the story of the vessel that had
sailed thither, manned by a merry
crew made merrier by drink, careless
of their course, depending on
the steadfast light, and sure, because
they did not see it, that they
had not neared the dangerous whirlpool
and hidden rocks. Only one
man escaped, and, trembling, told
the story. He had been the only
sober man on board; and when he
warned the captain of their danger,
he was laughed and mocked at for
his pains, and told that all true mariners
would stake the monks’ light
against the eyes of any man on
earth. It was not the Holy Cape
that they were nearing, but Cape
Brie, they said, and every one knew
it was safe sailing there. With jests
and oaths instead of prayers upon
their lips, with sin-stained souls,
they had gone down into that whirling
tide, which had swept them off
in its strong under-tow to sea.
There were homes that would be
desolate and hearts broken; there
were bodies drowned, and souls
launched into eternity&mdash;perhaps for
ever lost&mdash;for lack of one little
light, for the fault of a single half-hour.
And still the stars shone
brightly, and the long line of glory
stretched from shore to shore, and
the night was marvellously still;
but upon one soul there had fallen
a darkness that might be felt&mdash;almost
the darkness of despair.</p>

<p>“Monk Felix they had called
him, and had been wont to say that
he did not belie his name, with his
sweet young face and happy smile,
and his clear voice in the choir.
He was Monk Infelix now and while
time lasted.</p>

<p>“In the monastery none saw an
empty place; for the man whose
life had been the only one preserved
in that swift death-struggle had
begged, awed and repentant, to be
received into the number of these
brethren vowed to God’s peculiar
service. But in village and in
choir they missed him who had
gone in and out among them since
his boyhood, and under their breath
the people asked, ‘Where is he?’
No definite answer was given, but
a rumor crept about, and at length
prevailed, that Monk Felix had
despaired of pardon; that day and
night the awful death-cry rang in
his ears; and day and night he besought
God to punish here and
spare there, imploring that he might
also bear some of the punishment
of those souls that had passed away
through his neglect. And a year
from that night, and in the very hour,
the last rites having been given to
him as to the dying, the rock now
called the Friar’s had opened mysteriously.
Around it stood the
brotherhood, chanting the funeral
psalms very solemnly; and as the
words, “De profundis clamavi ad
Te, Domine,” were intoned, one left
their number, and, with steady step
and a face full of awe and yet of
thankfulness, entered the cleft, and
the rock closed.</p>

<p>“Years came and went, other
hands tended the lantern, till in
the Revolution the light of the
monks and the Order itself were
swept away, and the monastery was
laid in ruins. But the legend is
even now held for truth by simple
folk, that in Friar’s Rock the monk
lives still, hearing always the eddying
flood about him, that beats in
upon his memory the story of his
sin; and they say that with it mingles
ever the cry of men in their
last agony, and the cry is his name,
thus kept continually before the
Judge. There, in perpetual fast
and vigil, he watches and prays for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_786" id="Page_786">[786]</a></span>
the coming of the Lord and the salvation
of souls, and the rock that
forms his prison has been made to
take his shape by the action of
those revengeful waves. What he
knows of passing events&mdash;what
added misery and mystery it is that
now no longer the holy bell and
chant echo above him&mdash;none can
tell. But there, they say, whatever
chance or change shall come
to Bretagne, he must live and pray
and wait till the Lord comes.
Then, when the mountains fall and
the rocks are rent, his long penance
shall be over, and he shall enter
into peace.”</p>

<p>Anne looked at me. “Was it
very hard&mdash;too hard?” she asked.</p>

<p>“O Anne!” I cried, “it is not
true?”</p>

<p>She smiled. “I have more to
read,” she said; “more of fact, perhaps.”
So she went on.</p>

<p>“There is, in the archives of this
domain, an account of a settlement
some twenty miles from here, where
a horde of outlaws dwell in huts
and caves, their hand against every
man, and every man’s hand against
them. It was as much as one’s
life was worth to go among them,
unless one was ready to live as they
lived, and sin as they sinned. But
it is recorded that in the same year
in which is also recorded the loss
of a Dutch vessel by reason of the
failure of the light of the monks&mdash;an
event never known before, and
never again till the Revolution in
its great guilt quenched it and
shattered the sacred walls&mdash;there
came to these men a missionary
priest, seeking to save their souls.
They say he was a man who never
smiled, yet his very presence
brought comfort. Little children
loved him; and poor, down-trodden
women learned hope and patience
from him; and men consented to
have him there, and not to slay
him.</p>

<p>“Yet what he underwent was
fearful. He lived in a hovel so
mean that the storms drove through
it, and the floor was soaked with
rain or white with frost or snow.
No being in that place poorer,
more hungry, more destitute of
earthly comfort. Yet his crusts
he shared with the beggar, his pallet
of straw far oftener held the
child turned out from shelter, the
sick, the dying, than him. There
the leper found a home, and tendance,
not only of pity but of love&mdash;hands
that washed, lips that kissed,
prayers that upbore him in the
final struggle.</p>

<p>“We read of temptations from
devils which the saints have undergone;
there are those who presume
to doubt them. This man wrestled
with temptations from his brother
men, who seemed like very fiends,
and often, often, the anguish of
despair came upon him, and he
thought he was already lost, and a
wild desire almost overwhelmed
him to join them in their evil
ways. For, by some horrible instinct,
they seemed to divine that
pain to the body would be slight
to him compared to the tortures
which they could invent for his
soul. They came to his ministrations,
and mimicked him when he
spoke, and set their ribald songs to
sacred tunes. Before his door they
parodied the holiest rites. They
taught the children to do the same
things at their sports.</p>

<p>“And he&mdash;it is said that in the
pauses of midnight or noontide
rout and wild temptation they
heard him praying for them, and
praying for himself, like one who
had bound up his own life in the
bundle of their lives, and believed
that he would be lost or saved with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_787" id="Page_787">[787]</a></span>
them. It is said that at times he
rushed out among them like S.
Michael, and his voice was as a
trumpet, and he spoke of the wrath
of God; and, again, he would open
his door, and his face would be like
death, and he would tremble sorely,
as he begged them, like some tortured
creature, to cease from sin.
What they did was to him as if he
did it. He was so of them that
their temptations were his also, till
he often seemed to himself as sunk
in sin as any of them.</p>

<p>“Yet, one by one, souls went to
God from that fiend-beleaguered
place; babes with the cross hardly
dry upon their foreheads; children
taught to love the God whom once
they had only known to curse;
some of those sick made for ever
well, some of those lepers made
for ever clean. The priest set up
crosses on their graves, and sacrilegious
hands broke them down; but
no hands could stop his prayers
and praises for the souls that by
God’s blessing he had won. He
tried to build a little chapel, and
they rent it stone from stone; but
none could destroy the temple of
living stones built up to God out
of that mournful spot.</p>

<p>“A Lent came when as never before
he strove with and for these
people. It was as if an angel spoke
to them. An angel? Nay, a very
man like themselves, as tempted as
any of them, a sinner suffering from
his sin; yet a man and a sinner
who loved God, believed in God,
knew that he would come to judge,
yet knew he was mighty to save.
That Lent, Satan himself held sway
there; new and more vile and awful
blasphemies surged through the
place; it was his last carnival, and
it was a mad one. Men held women
back from church if they wished
to worship, but followed them
there and elsewhere to darker
deeds of sacrilege and revelry than
even they had known before. Yet
in the gray dawn, when sleep overpowered
the revellers, a few people
crept to that holy hut round which
the sinners had danced their dance
of defiance and death and sin, and
there sought for pardon and blessing,
and knelt before the Lord, who
shunned not the poor earth-altar
where a priest pleaded daily for
souls, as for so long he had done,
except on the rare occasions when
he would be gone for a night and a
day, they knew not where, and return
with fresh vigor and courage.</p>

<p>“Thursday in Holy Week he
kept his watch with the Master in
his agony. Round him the storm
of evil deeds and words rose high.
In the midst of it the rioters thought
they saw a vision. It was a moonlight
night, and marvellously still;
no wind moved the trees, and the
water was like glass. But all the
silence of earth was broken by hideous
shout and song, and all its
brightness turned to darkness by
such deeds of evil as Christians
may not name. Before those creatures
steeped in sin, wallowing in
it, one stood suddenly, haggard,
spent as beneath some great burden,
wan as with awful suffering.
The moonbeams wrapped him in
unearthly light, he seemed of heaven,
and yet a sufferer. He did not
speak; how could he speak, who
had pleaded with them again and
again by day, and spent his nights
in prayer, for such return as this?
He lifted up his eyes, and spread
his arms. He looked to them like
one upon a cross. ‘The Christ!
The Christ!’ they murmured, awestruck.
And then, ‘Slay him!’ some
one shouted frantically. There
came a crash of stones, of wood, of
jagged iron, and in the midst a distinct,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_788" id="Page_788">[788]</a></span>
intense voice, ‘O Lord Jesus,
forgive us.’ They had heard the
last of the prayers that vexed
them.</p>

<p>“On Good Friday morning, as
the brotherhood came from Prime,
a strange being, more like a beast
than a man,, approached them.
‘Come to us,’ he said in a scarcely
intelligible dialect&mdash;‘come to the
<i lang="fr">Dol des Fées</i>: The abbot asked
no questions, and made no delay.
He bade one of the older monks accompany
him, and together they
sought the place. Before they
reached it, sounds of loud, hoarse
wailing were borne to them upon
the breeze; and their guide, on hearing
them, broke forth into groans
like the groans of a beast, and beat
his breast, and cried, ‘My father,
my father! My sin, my sin!’</p>

<p>“They saw hovels and caves,
deserted; among the poorest, one
still poorer; about it, men, women,
and children wrung their hands
or sobbed and tore their hair, or
lay despairing on the ground. Entering,
four bare walls met their
view; then a pallet, where an idiot
grinned and pointed. Following
his pointing finger, they saw an
earth-altar where the light still
burned. Before it one lay at rest.
Wrapped in his tattered robe; his
hands clasped, as though he prayed
yet, above the crucifix upon his
heart; hands, neck, and face bruised
and battered and red with blood;
his face was of one at peace. The
contest was ended. He who lay
there dead lay there a victor, by the
grace of God. Around him his
people, for whom he gave his life,
begged for the very help they had
so long refused. And soon, where
so long he labored, sowing good
seed in tears, the reapers went with
shouting, bringing their sheaves with
them. That which had been the
abode of sinners has become years
since the abode of saints.</p>

<p>“Thanks be to God!”</p>

<p>“But it was such a little sin,” I
said, as Anne put the paper by.</p>

<p>“How great a sin lost Eden?”
she asked gravely. “Besides, we
cannot tell what spiritual pride or
carelessness, unknown or hidden,
may have led to such a fall. But,
dear, it was not anything of that
sort I wanted to talk about, but the
mercy, and how it explains what
we were speaking of.”</p>

<p>“The mercy?” I repeated.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said fervently. “To
be punished, and yet the very punishment
to contain the power to
pray on still&mdash;to speak to God&mdash;to
plead with him for souls, the souls
he died for on the cross. What
though one were shut for all time in
Friar’s Rock, if one trusted that at
the end the Vision of God would be
his for ever, and till then could and
must ask him continually to have
mercy on immortal souls? Or who
would not live that living death in
<i lang="fr">Dol des Fées</i> to live it in prayer at
the altar, and to die a martyr’s
death?</p>

<p>“Joanne, my darling, what, after
all, are sorrow and death and separation
and loneliness to us who can
speak to God? In him we are all
brought near. His blood makes
each of his children dear to those
who love him. Day by day to forget
self in them, in him; day by
day to let grief or pleasure grow
less and less in one absorbing prayer
that his kingdom come; day by day
to lose one’s self in him&mdash;<em>that</em> is
living, and <em>that</em> is loving. I cannot
mourn much for my precious ones
that are only absent from my sight,
but safe and present with him; my
tears are for souls that are <em>not</em> safe,
the wide world over; and I cannot
miss much what I have never really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_789" id="Page_789">[789]</a></span>
lost. A thousand times Friar’s
Rock speaks to me, and this is
what it says:</p>

<p>“‘If thou, Lord, wilt mark iniquities,
Lord, who shall stand it?</p>

<p>“‘For with thee there is merciful
forgiveness; and by reason of
thy law I have waited&mdash;<em>for thee</em>, O
Lord.</p>

<p>“‘From the morning watch even
until night, let Israel hope in the
Lord.</p>

<p>“‘Because with the Lord there is mercy,
and with him plentiful redemption.</p>

<p>“‘And he shall redeem Israel
from all his iniquities.’”</p>

<p>It was years ago, as I have said,
that Anne d’Estaing told me this
legend. Since then, her parents
have died, the château has passed
into other hands, she is head of a
convent in Bretagne, and I&mdash;I lie
here, the last of my name, a hopeless
invalid, with not a penny to
call my own. Rich once, and
young, and fair, and proud; sad
once, and doubting how to bear a
lonely future, I know the meaning of
Anne’s story now. “I have waited
<em>for thee</em>, O Lord! And he shall redeem
Israel from all his iniquities.”</p>

<p>While I wait for him, I pray. It
does not grieve me that I do not hear
from Anne. La Mère Angélique
is more to me, and nearer to me,
than when, in days long past, we
spoke face to face. For I <em>know</em> we
meet in the sure refuge of the Sacred
Heart of Jesus, and that, with
saints on earth and saints in glory,
and the souls beneath the altar, we
pray together the same prayer&mdash;“Thy
kingdom come.”</p>

<h3>SPACE.<br />
<span class="smaller">III.</span></h3>

<p>Bodies have bulk or volume,
whereby they are said to occupy a
certain place, and to fill it with
their dimensions. Hence, to complete
our task, we have now to consider
space in relation with the volumes
and places of bodies. To
proceed orderly, we must first determine
the proper definition of
“place,” and its division; then we
shall examine a few questions concerning
the relation of each body
to its place, and particularly the
difficult and interesting one whether
bodies can be really bilocated
and multilocated.</p>

<p><i>Place.</i>&mdash;Aristotle, in the fourth
book of his <cite>Physics</cite>, defines the
place of a body as “the surface by
which the body is immediately surrounded
and enveloped”&mdash;“<i lang="la">Locus est
extrema superficies corporis continentis
immobilis.</i>” This definition was
accepted by nearly all the ancients.
The best of their representatives,
S. Thomas, says: “<i lang="la">Locus est terminus
corporis continentis</i>”&mdash;viz., The
place of a body is the surface of
the body which contains it; and
the Schoolmen very generally define
place to be “the concave surface
of the surrounding body: <i lang="la">Superficies
concava corporis ambientis.</i>”
Thus, according to the followers
of Aristotle, no body can have
place unless it is surrounded by
some other body. Immobility was
also believed to be necessarily included
in the notion of place: <i lang="la">Superficies
immobilis.</i> Cardinal de
Lugo says: “the word <em>place</em>
seems to be understood as meaning
the real surface of a surrounding
body, not, however, as simply having
its extension all around, but as
immovable&mdash;that is, as attached to
a determinate imaginary space.”<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
We do not see what can be the
meaning of this last phrase. For
De Lugo holds that “real space”
is the equivalent of “place,” and
that space, as distinguished from
place, is nothing real: <i lang="la">Non est
aliquid reale.</i><a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> His imaginary space
is, therefore, a mere nothing. How
are we, then, to understand that a
real surface can be “attached to
a determinate imaginary space”?
Can a real being be attached to a
determinate nothing? Are there
many nothings? or nothings possessing
distinct determinations?
We think that these questions must
all be answered in the negative,
and that neither Cardinal de Lugo,
nor any one else who considers imaginary
space as a mere nothing,
can account for the immobility
thus attributed to place.</p>

<p>The reason why Aristotle’s definition
of place came to be generally
adopted by the old Schoolmen is
very plain. For, in the place occupied
by any given body, two things
can be considered, viz., the limiting
surface, and the dimensive quantity
which extends within the limiting
surface. Now, as the ancients believed
the matter of which bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_791" id="Page_791">[791]</a></span>
are composed to be endowed with
continuity, it was natural that they
should look upon the dimensive
quantity included within the limiting
surface as an appurtenance of
the matter itself, and that they
should consider it, not as an intrinsic
constituent of the place occupied,
but as a distinct reality through
which the body could occupy a
certain place. According to this
notion of dimensive quantity, the
limiting surface was retained as the
sole constituent of the place occupied;
and the dimensions within
the surface being thus excluded
from the notion of place, were attached
to the matter of the body
itself, as a special accident inhering
in it.</p>

<p>This manner of conceiving things
is still looked upon as unobjectionable
by those philosophers who
think that the old metaphysics has
been carried to such a degree of
perfection by the peripatetics as to
have nothing or little to learn from
the modern positive sciences. But
whoever has once realized the fact
that the dimensions of bodies are
not continuous lines of matter, but
intervals, or relations, in space, will
agree that such dimensions do not
<em>inhere</em> in the matter, but are extrinsic
relations between material terms
distinctly ubicated. What is called
the volume of a body is nothing but
the resultant of a system of relations
in space. The matter of the
body supplies nothing to its constitution
except the extrinsic terms
of the relations. The foundation
of those relations is not to be found
in the body, but in space alone, as
we have proved in our last article;
and the relations themselves do not
<em>inhere</em> in the terms, but only <em>intervene</em>
between them. Hence the dimensive
quantity of the volume
is intrinsically connected with the
place it occupies, and must enter
into the definition of place as its
material constituent, as we are going
to show.</p>

<p>As to the Aristotelic definition
of place, we have the following objections:
First, a good definition
always consists of two notions, the
one generic and determinable, as
its material element, the other differential
and determinant, as its
formal element. Now, Aristotle’s
definition of place exhibits at best
only the formal or determinant, and
omits entirely the material or determinable.
It is evident, in fact,
that the surface of any given body
determines the limits and the figure
of something involved in the notion
of place. But what is this
something? It cannot be a mere
nothing; for nothing does not receive
limits and figure, as real limits
and real figure must be settled
upon something real. This something
must therefore be either the
quantity of the matter, or the quantity
of the volume enclosed within
the limiting surface. And as we
cannot admit that the quantity of
the place occupied by a body is
the quantity of matter contained
in the body (because bodies which
have different quantities of matter
can occupy equal places), we are
bound to conclude that the quantity
of the place occupied by a body
is the quantity of the volume comprised
within the limiting surface.
This is the determinable or material
constituent of place; for this, and
this alone, is determined by the
concave surface of the surrounding
body. In the same manner as a
cubic body contains dimensions
within its cubic form, so also a cubic
place contains dimensions under
its cubic surface; hence the
place of a body has volume, the
same volume as the body; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_792" id="Page_792">[792]</a></span>
therefore it cannot be defined as a
mere limiting surface.</p>

<p>Secondly, the definition of a thing
should express what every one understands
the thing to be. But no
one understands the word “place”
as meaning the exterior limit of the
body which occupies it, therefore
the exterior limit of the body is not
the true definition of place. The
minor of this syllogism is manifest.
For we predicate of place many
things which cannot be predicated
of the exterior limit of the body.
We say, for instance, that a place is
full, half-full, or empty; that it is
capable of so many objects, persons,
etc.; and it is plain that these predicates
cannot appertain to the exterior
limit of the body, but they
exclusively belong to the capacity
within the limiting boundary.
Hence a definition of place which
overlooks such a capacity is defective.</p>

<p>Thirdly, to equal quantities of
limiting surfaces do not necessarily
correspond equal quantities of
place. Therefore, the limiting surface
is not synonymous with place,
and cannot be its definition. The
antecedent is well known. Take
two cylinders having equal surfaces,
but whose bases and altitudes are
to one another in different ratios.
It is evident by geometry that such
cylinders will have different capacities&mdash;that
is, there will be more occupable
or occupied room in the one
than in the other. The consequence,
too, is plain; for, if the room, or
place, can be greater or less while
the limiting surface does not become
greater or less, it is clear that
the place is not the limiting surface.</p>

<p>Fourthly, what Aristotle and his
school called “the surface of the
surrounding body,” is now admitted
to be formed by an assemblage
of unextended material points, perfectly
isolated; and therefore such
a surface does not constitute a continuous
material envelope, as it was
believed in earlier times. Now,
since those isolated points have no
dimensions, but are simply terms of
the dimensions in space, the so-called
“surface” owes its own dimensions
to the free intervals between
those points, just as the dimensions
also of the volume enclosed
owe their existence to similar intervals
between the same points.
Therefore the same terms which
mark in space the limit of place,
mark also its volume; and thus the
volume under the surface belongs
to the place itself no less than does
the limiting surface.</p>

<p>Fifthly, a body in vacuum would
have its absolute place; and yet in
vacuum there is no surface of surrounding
bodies. Therefore an
exterior surrounding body is not
needed to constitute place. In fact,
the body itself determines its own
place by the extreme terms of its
own bodily dimensions. This the
philosophers of the peripatetic
school could not admit, because
they thought that the place of the
body could not move with the body,
but ought to remain “attached to
a determinate imaginary space.”
But, in so reasoning, they confounded
the absolute place with the relative,
as will be shown hereafter. Yet
they conceded that a body in vacuum
would have its place; and,
when asked to point out there the
surface of a surrounding body, they
could not answer, except by abandoning
the Aristotelic definition and
by resorting to the centre and the
poles of the world, thus exchanging
the absolute place (<i lang="la">locus</i>) for the
relative (<i lang="la">situs</i>), without reflecting
that they had no right to admit a
relative place where, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_793" id="Page_793">[793]</a></span>
their definition, the absolute was
wanting.</p>

<p>Sixthly, the true definition of
place must be so general as to be
applicable to all possible places.
But the Aristotelic definition does
not apply to all places. Therefore
such a definition is not true. The
major of our argument needs no
proof. The minor is proved thus:
There are places not only within
surfaces, but also within lines, and
on the lines themselves; for, if on
the surface of a body we describe a
circle or a triangle, it is evident
that a place will be marked and determined
on that surface. Its limiting
boundary, however, will be,
not the surface of a surrounding
body, but simply the circumference
of the circle, or the perimeter of the
triangle.</p>

<p>For these reasons we maintain
that place cannot properly be defined
as “the surface of the surrounding
body.” As to the additional
limitation, that such a surface
should be considered as “immovable”&mdash;that
is, affixed to a determinate
space (imaginary, of
course, according to the peripatetic
theory, and therefore wholly fictitious)&mdash;we
need only say that even
if it were possible to attach the surface
of a body to a determinate
space, which is not the case, yet
this condition could not be admitted
in the definition of place, because
the <em>absolute</em> place of a body
is invariably the same, wherever it
be, in absolute space, and does not
change except as compared with
other places. Absolute place, just
as absolute ubication, has but one
manner of existing in absolute
space; for all places, considered in
themselves, are extrinsic terminations
of the <em>same</em> infinite virtuality,
and are all <em>equally</em> in the centre,
so to say, of its infinite expanse,
whatever be their mutual relations.</p>

<p><i>True Notion of Place.</i>&mdash;What is,
then, the true definition of place?
Webster describes it in his <cite>Dictionary</cite>
as “a particular portion of
space of indefinite extent, occupied,
or intended to be occupied, by any
person or thing, and considered as
the space where a person or thing
does or may rest, or has rested, as
distinct from space in general.”
This is in fact the meaning of the
word “place” in the popular language.
The philosophical definition
of place, as gathered from this
description, would be: “Place is
a particular portion of space.”
This is the very definition which all
philosophers, before Aristotle, admitted,
and which Aristotle endeavored
to refute, on the ground that,
when a body moves through space,
its place remains intrinsically the
same.</p>

<p>We have shown in our last article
that space considered in itself
has no parts; but those who admit
portion of space, consider space as
a reality dependent on the dimensions
of the bodies by which it is
occupied&mdash;that is, they call “space”
those resultant relative intervals
which have their foundation in
space itself. If we were to take
the word “space” in this popular
sense, we might well say that “place
is a portion of space,” because any
given place is but one out of the
many places determined by the
presence of bodies in the whole
world. On the other hand, since
space, properly so called, is itself
<em>virtually</em> extended&mdash;that is, equivalent
in its absolute simplicity to infinite
extension, and since <em>virtual</em>
extension suggests the thought of
<em>virtual</em> parts, we might admit that
there are <em>virtual</em> portions of space
in this sense, that space as the foundation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_794" id="Page_794">[794]</a></span>
of all local relations corresponds
by its virtuality to all the dimensions
and intervals mensurable
between all terms ubicated, and receives
from them distinct extrinsic
denominations. Thus, space as
occupied by the sun is virtually
distinguished from itself as occupied
by the moon, not because it
has a distinct entity in the sun and
another in the moon, but because
it has two distinct extrinsic terminations.
We might therefore admit
that place is “a virtual portion of
space determined by material limits”;
and we might even omit the
epithet “virtual” if it were understood
that the word “space” was
taken as synonymous with the dimensions
of bodies, as is taken by
those who deny the reality of vacuum.
But, though this manner of speaking
is and will always remain popular,
owing to its agreement with our
imagination and to its conciseness,
which makes it preferable for our
ordinary intercourse, we think that
the place of a body, in proper philosophical
language, should be defined
as “a system of correlations between
the terms which mark out the limits
of the body in space”; and therefore
place in general, whether really
occupied or not, should be defined
as “a system of correlations between
ubications marking out the
limits of dimensive quantity.”</p>

<p>This definition expresses all that
we imply and that Webster includes
in the description of place; but it
changes the somewhat objectionable
phrase “portion of space” into
what people mean by it, viz., “a
system of correlations between distinct
ubications,” thereby showing
that it is not the absolute entity
of fundamental space, but only the
resultant relations in space, that
enter into the intrinsic constitution
of place.</p>

<p>By “a system of correlations”
we mean the adequate result of the
combination of all the intervals
from every single term to every
other within the limits assumed, in
every direction. Such a result will
therefore represent either a volume,
or a surface, or a line, according
as the terms considered within the
given limits are differently disposed
in space. Thus a spherical place
results from the mutual relations
intervening between all the terms
of its geometric surface; and therefore
it implies all the intervals
which can be measured, and all the
lines that can be traced, in all directions,
from any of those terms to
any other within the given limits.
In like manner, a triangular place
results from the mutual relations
intervening between all the terms
forming its perimeter; and therefore
it implies all the intervals and
lines of movement which can be
traced, in all directions, from any of
those terms to any other within the
given limits.</p>

<p>In the definition we have given,
the material or determinable element
is the system of correlations
or intervals which are mensurable
within the limiting terms; the formal
or determinant is the disposition
of the limiting terms themselves&mdash;that
is, the definite boundary
which determines the extent of
those intervals, and gives to the
place a definite shape.</p>

<p>Thus it appears that, although
there is no place without space,
nevertheless the entity of space
does not enter into the constitution
of place as an intrinsic constituent,
but only as the extrinsic foundation.
This is what we have endeavored
to express as clearly as
we could in our definition of place.
As, however, in our ordinary intercourse
we cannot well speak of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_795" id="Page_795">[795]</a></span>
place with such nice circumlocutions
as are needed in philosophical
treatises, we do not much object
to the common notion that place is
“space intercepted by a limiting
boundary,” and we ourselves have
no difficulty in using this expression,
out of philosophy, owing to the
loose meaning attached to the
word “space” in common language;
for all distances and intervals in
space are called “spaces,” even in
mechanics; and thus, when we hear
of “space intercepted,” we know
that the speakers do not refer to
the absolute entity of space (which
they have been taught to identify
with nothingness), but merely to
the intervals resulting from the extrinsic
terminations of that entity.</p>

<p>Most of the Schoolmen (viz., all
those who considered void space as
imaginary and unreal) agreed, as we
have intimated, with Aristotle, that
the notion of place involves nothing
but the surface of a surrounding
body, and contended that within
the limits of that surface there
was no such chimerical thing as
mere space, but only the quantity
of the body itself. Suarez, in his
<cite>Metaphysics</cite> (Disp. 51, sect. 1, n.
9), mentions the opinion of those
who maintained that place is the
space occupied by a body, and
argues against it on the ground
that no one can say what kind of
being such a space is. Some have
affirmed, says he, that such a space
is a body indivisible and immaterial&mdash;which
leads to an open contradiction&mdash;though
they perhaps
considered this body to be “indivisible,”
not because it had no parts,
but because its parts could not be
separated. They also called it
“immaterial,” on account of its
permeability to all bodies. But
this opinion, he justly adds, is
against reason and even against
faith; for, on the one hand this
space should be eternal, uncreated,
and infinite, whilst on the other no
body can be admitted to have these
attributes.</p>

<p>Others, Suarez continues, thought
that the space which can be occupied
by bodies is mere quantity
extending all around without end.
This opinion was refuted by Aristotle,
and is inadmissible, because
there cannot be quantitative dimensions
without a substance, and because
the bodies which would occupy
such a space have already
their own dimensions, which cannot
be compenetrated with the dimensions
of space. And moreover,
such a quantity would be either
eternal and uncreated&mdash;which is
against faith&mdash;or created with all
other things, and therefore created
in space; which shows that space
itself is not such a quantity.</p>

<p>Others finally opine, with greater
probability, says he, that space, as
distinct from the bodies that fill it,
is nothing real and positive, but a
mere emptiness, implying both the
absence of bodies and the aptitude
to be filled by bodies. Of this
opinion Toletus says (4 <cite>Phys.</cite> q. 3)
that it is probable, and that it cannot
be demonstratively refuted.
Yet, adds Suarez, it can be shown
that such a space, as distinct from
bodies, is in fact nothing; for it is
neither a substance nor an accident,
nor anything created or temporal,
but eternal.</p>

<p>Such is the substance of the reasons
adduced by Suarez to prove
that the space occupied by bodies
is nothing real. Had he, like Lessius,
turned his thought to the extrinsic
terminability of God’s immensity,
he would have easily discovered
that, to establish the reality
of space, none of those old hypotheses
which he refuted were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_796" id="Page_796">[796]</a></span>
needed. As we have already settled
this point in a preceding article,
we will not return to it. It may,
however, be remarked that what
Suarez says regarding the incompenetrability
of the quantity of
space with the quantity of the body
is based entirely on the assumption
that bodies have their own volume
independently of space&mdash;an assumption
which, though plausibly
maintained by the ancients, can by
no means be reconciled with the
true notion of the volume of bodies
as now established by physical
science and accepted by all philosophers.
As all dimensive quantity
arises from relations in space, so it
is owing to space itself that bodies
have volume; and therefore there
are not, as the ancients imagined,
two volumes compenetrated, the
one of space, and the other of matter;
but there is one volume alone
determined by the material terms
related through space. And thus
there is no ground left for the compenetration
of two quantities.</p>

<p>S. Thomas also, in his Commentary
to the <cite>Physics</cite> of Aristotle (4
<cite>Phys.</cite> lect. 6), and in the opuscule,
<cite>De Natura Loci</cite>, argues that there is
no space within the limiting surface
of the body, for two reasons. The
first is, that such a quantity of
space would be an accident without
a subject: <i lang="la">Sequitur quod esset aliquod
accidens absque subjecto; quod
est impossibile</i>. The second is, that
if there is space within the surface
of the body, as all the parts of the
body are in the volume of the same,
so will the places of all the parts be
in the place of the whole; and consequently,
there will be as many
places compenetrated with one another
as there can be divisions in
the dimensions of the body. But
these dimensions admit of an infinite
division. Therefore, infinite
places will be compenetrated together:
<i lang="la">Sequitur quod sint infinita
loca simul; quod est impossibile</i>.</p>

<p>These two reasons could not but
have considerable weight in a time
when material continuity formed
the base of the physical theory of
quantity, and when space without
matter was considered a chimera;
but in our time the case is quite
different. To the first reason we
answer, that the space within the
surface of the body will not be “an
accident without a subject.” In
fact, such a space can be understood
in two manners, viz., either as the
foundation of the intervals, or as
the intervals themselves; and in
neither case will there be an accident
without a subject. For, the
space which is the foundation of
the intervals is no accident; it is
the virtuality of God’s immensity,
as we have proved; and, therefore,
there can be no question about its
subject. Moreover, such a space
is indeed within the limits of the
body, but it is also without, as it is
not limited by them. These limits,
as compared with space, are extrinsic
terms; and therefore they
do not belong to space, but to the
body alone. Lastly, although without
space there can be no place,
yet space is neither the material
nor the formal constituent of place,
but only the extrinsic ground of
local relations, just as eternity is
not an intrinsic constituent of time,
but only the extrinsic ground of
successive duration. Whence it is
manifest that the entity of space is
not the dimensive quantity of the
body, but the eminent reason of
its dimensions.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, space is
understood in the popular sense as
meaning the accidental intervals
between the limits of the body, then
it is evident that such intervals will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_797" id="Page_797">[797]</a></span>
not be without their proportionate
subject. Relations have a subject
of predication, not of inhesion; for
relation is a thing whose entity, according
to the scholastic definition,
consists entirely of a mere connotation;
<i lang="la">cuius totum esse est ad aliud
se habere</i>. Hence all relation is
merely <i lang="la">ad aliud</i>, and cannot be <i lang="la">in
alio</i>. Accordingly, the intervals
between the terms of the body are
<em>between</em> them, but do not inhere in
them; and they have a sufficient
subject&mdash;the only subject, indeed,
which they require, for the very
reason that they exist <em>between</em> real
terms, with a real foundation.
Thus the first reason objected is
radically solved.</p>

<p>To the second reason we answer,
that it is impossible to conceive an
infinite multitude of places in one
total place, unless we admit the existence
of an infinite multitude of
limiting terms&mdash;that is, unless we
assume that matter is mathematically
continuous. But, since material
continuity is now justly considered
as a baseless and irrational
hypothesis, as our readers know,
the compenetration of <em>infinite</em>
places with one another becomes
an impossibility.</p>

<p>Yet, as all bodies contain a very
great number of material terms, it
may be asked: Would the existence
of space within the limits of
place prove the compenetration of
a <em>finite</em> number of places? Would
it prove, for instance, that the
places of different bodies existing
in a given room compenetrate the
place of the room? The answer
depends wholly on the meaning
attached to the word “space.” If
we take “space” as the foundation
of the relations between the terms
of a place, then different places will
certainly be compenetrated, inasmuch
as the entity of space is the
same, though differently terminated,
in every one of them. But,
if we take “space” as meaning the
system of relative intervals between
the terms of a body, then the place
of a room will not be compenetrated
with the places of the bodies it
contains; because neither the intervals
nor the terms of one place
are the intervals or the terms of
another, nor have they anything
common except the absolute entity
of their extrinsic foundation. Now,
since place is not space properly,
but only a system of correlations
between ubications marking out the
limits of the body in space, it follows
that no compenetration of one
place with another is possible so
long as the terms of the one do not
coincide with the terms of the
other.</p>

<p>S. Thomas remarks also, in the
same place, that if a recipient full
of water contains space, then, besides
the dimensions of the water,
there would be in the same recipient
the dimensions of space, and
these latter would therefore be
compenetrated with the former.
<i lang="la">Quum aqua est in vase, præter dimensiones
aquæ sunt ibi aliæ dimensiones
spatii penetrantes dimensiones aquæ.</i>
This would certainly be the case
were it true that the dimensions of
the body are materially continuous,
as S. Thomas with all his contemporaries
believed. But the truth is
that the dimensions of bodies do
not consist in the extension of continuous
matter, but in the extension
of the intervals between the limits
of the bodies, which is greater or
less according as it requires a
greater or less extension of movement
to be measured. The volume
of a body&mdash;that is, the quantity of
the place it occupies&mdash;is exactly the
same whether it be full or empty,
provided the limiting terms remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_798" id="Page_798">[798]</a></span>
the same and in the same relation
to one another. It is not the matter,
therefore, that constitutes its
dimensions. And then there are,
and can be, no distinct dimensions
of matter compenetrating the dimensions
of place. But enough
about the nature of place. Let us
proceed to its division.</p>

<p><i>Division of Place.</i>&mdash;Place in general
may be divided into <em>real</em> and
<em>imaginary</em>, according as its limiting
terms exist in nature or are only
imagined by us. This division is
so clear that it needs no explanation.
It might be asked whether
there are not also <em>ideal</em> places. We
answer, that strictly ideal places
there are none; for the ideal is the
object of our intellect, whilst place
is the object of our senses and
imagination. Hence the so-called
“ideal” places are nothing but
“imaginary” places.</p>

<p>Place, whether real or imaginary,
is again divided by geometers into
<em>linear</em>, <em>superficial</em>, and <em>cubic</em> or solid,
according to the nature of their limiting
boundaries. A place limited
by surfaces is the place of a volume
or geometric solid. A place limited
by lines is the place of a surface.
A place limited by mere
points is the place of a line.</p>

<p>The ancients, when defining
place as “the surface of the surrounding
body,” connected the notion
of place with the quantity of
volume, without taking notice of
the other two kinds just mentioned.
This, too, was a necessary consequence
of their assumption of continuous
matter. For, if matter is
intrinsically extended in length,
breadth, and depth, all places must
be extended in a similar manner.
But it is a known fact that the word
“place” (<i lang="la">locus</i>) is used now, and
was used in all times, in connection
not only with geometric volumes,
but also with geometric surfaces and
with geometric lines; and as the
geometric quantities have their
counterpart in the physical order,
it is manifest that such geometric
places cannot be excluded from
the division of place. Can we not
on any surface draw a line circumscribing
a circle or any other close
figure? And can we not point out
the “place” where the circle or
figure is marked out? There are
therefore places of which the boundaries
are lines, not surfaces. And
again, can we not fix two points on
a given line, and consider the interval
between them as one of the
many places which can be designated
along the line? The word
“place” in its generality applies to
any kind of dimensive quantity in
space. Those who pretend to limit it
to “the surface of a volume” should
tell us what other term is to be used
when we have to mention the place
of a plane figure on a wall, or of a
linear length on the intersection of
two surfaces. It will be said that
the ancients in this case used the
word <i lang="la">Ubi</i>. But we reply that <i lang="la">Ubi</i> and
<i lang="la">Locus</i> were taken by them as synonymous.
The quantities bounded
by lines, or terminated by points,
were therefore equivalently admitted
to have their own “places”;
which proves that the definition of
place which philosophers left us in
their books, did not express all that
they themselves meant when using
the word, and therefore it was not
practically insisted upon. With us
the case is different. The <i lang="la">Ubi</i>, as
defined by us, designates a single
point in space, and is distinct from
<i lang="la">locus</i>; hence we do not admit that
our <i lang="la">ubi</i> is a place; for there is no
place within a point. But the philosophers
of the old school could
not limit the real ubication of matter
to a mere point, owing to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_799" id="Page_799">[799]</a></span>
opinion that matter was continuous.</p>

<p>Thus we have three supreme
kinds of place&mdash;the linear, with one
dimension, length; the superficial,
with two dimensions, length and
breadth; the cubic or solid, with
three dimensions, length, breadth,
and depth. The true characteristic
difference between these kinds of
place is drawn from their <em>formal</em>
constituents, viz., from their boundaries.
The cubic place is a place
terminated by surfaces. The superficial
place is a place terminated
by lines. The linear place is a place
terminated by two points.</p>

<p>These supreme species admit of
further subdivision, owing to the
different geometrical figures affected
by their respective boundaries.
Thus the place of a body may be
tetrahedric, hexahedric, spherical,
etc., and the place of a surface may
be triangular, polygonal, circular,
etc.</p>

<p>Place is also divided into <em>absolute</em>
and <em>relative</em>. It is called absolute
when it is considered <i lang="la">secundum se</i>&mdash;that
is, as to its entity, or as consisting
of a system of correlation within
a definite limit. It is called relative
when it is considered in connection
with some other place or
places, as more or less distant from
them, or as having with respect
to them this or that position or
situation.</p>

<p>The absolute place of a body,
whatever our imagination may suggest
to the contrary, is always the
same as long as the body remains
under the same dimensions, be it at
rest or in movement. In fact, whenever
we speak of a change of place,
we mean that the place of a body
acquires a new relation to the place
of some other body&mdash;that is, we
mean the mere change of its relativity.
When the world was believed
to be a sphere of continuous
matter with no real space outside
of it, the absolute place of a body
could be considered as corresponding
to one or another definite portion
of that sphere, and therefore
as changeable; but since the reality
of infinite space independent of
matter has been established, it is
manifest that absolute place has no
relation to the limits of the material
world, but only to the infinity of
space, with respect to which bodies
cannot change their place any more
than a point can change its ubication.
Hence, when a body moves,
its relative place, or, better, the relativity
of its place to the places of
other bodies, is changed; but its
absolute place remains the same.
Thus the earth, in describing its
orbit, takes different positions round
the sun, and, while preserving its
absolute place unchanged, it undergoes
a continuous change of its relativity.</p>

<p>Lastly, place is also divided into
<em>intrinsic</em> and <em>extrinsic</em>. Omitting
the old explanations of this division,
we may briefly state that the intrinsic
place is that which is determined
by the dimensions and
boundary of the body, and therefore
is coextensive with it. The extrinsic
place of a body is a place
greater than the body which is
placed in it. Thus Rome is the extrinsic
place of the Vatican Palace,
and the Vatican Palace is the extrinsic
place of the Pope; because
the Vatican Palace is in Rome, and
the Pope in the Vatican Palace.</p>

<p><i>Occupation of Place.</i>&mdash;We have
now to answer a few questions
about the occupation of place. The
first is, whether bodies fill the
space they occupy. The second is,
whether the same place can be simultaneously
occupied by two bodies.
The third is, whether the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_800" id="Page_800">[800]</a></span>
limits and conserves the body it
contains. The fourth is, whether
the same body can be miraculously
in two places or more at the same
time.</p>

<p>That bodies fill place is a very
common notion, because people do
not make any marked distinction
between filling and occupying. But
to fill and to occupy are not synonymous.
To fill a place is to leave
no vacuum within it; and this is
evidently impossible without continuous
matter. As we have proved
that continuous matter does not
exist, we cannot admit that any
part of place, however small, can
be <em>filled</em>. Place, however, is <em>occupied</em>.
In fact, the material elements
of which bodies are ultimately composed,
by their presence in space
occupy distinct points in space&mdash;that
is, take possession of them,
maintain themselves in them, and
from them direct their action all
around, by which they manifest to
us their existence, ubication, and
other properties. This is the meaning
of <em>occupation</em>. Hence the formal
reason of occupation is the
presence of material elements in
space. Therefore, the place of a
body is occupied by the presence
in it of discrete material points,
none of which fill space&mdash;that is to
say, the place is occupied, not filled.
The common expression, “a place
filled with matter,” may, however,
be admitted in this sense, that when
the place is occupied by a body, it
does not naturally allow the intrusion
of another body. This
amounts to saying, not that the
place is really filled, but that the
resistance offered by the body to
the intrusion of another body prevents
its passage as effectually as if
there were left no occupable room.
So much for the first question.</p>

<p>The second question may be answered
thus: Since space is not
filled by the occupying bodies, the
reason why bodies exclude one
another from their respective places
must be traced not to a want of
room in them, but only to their
mutual opposite actions. These actions
God can neutralize and overcome
by an action of His own; and
if this be done, nothing will remain
that can prevent the compenetration
of two bodies and of their respective
places. It is therefore possible,
at least supernaturally, for two
bodies to occupy the same place.
Nevertheless, we must bear in mind
that, as the elements of the one
body are not the elements of the
other, so the ubications of the first
set of elements are not the ubications
of the second, and consequently
the correlations of the first
set are not identically the correlations
of the second. Hence, if
one body penetrates into the place
of another body, their places will
be intertwined, but distinct from
each other.</p>

<p>The third question must be answered
in the negative, notwithstanding
the contrary opinion of all
the Peripatetics. The place does
not limit and conserve the body by
which it is occupied; it is the body
itself that limits and conserves its
own place. For what is it that
gives to a place its formal determination,
and its specific and numeric
distinction from all other places,
but its extreme boundary? Now,
this boundary is marked out by the
very elements which constitute the
limits of the body. It is, therefore,
the body itself that by its own limits
defines the limits of its own place,
and constitutes the place formally
such or such. There is the same
connection between a body and its
place as between movement and its
duration. There is no movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_801" id="Page_801">[801]</a></span>
without time, nor time without
movement; but movement does not
result from time, for it is time itself
that results from movement. Hence,
the duration of the movement is
limited by the movement itself. In
like manner, there is no body without
place, and no place without a
body; but the body does not result
from the place, for it is the place itself
that results from the presence
of the body in space. Hence, the
place of the body is formally determined
by the body itself. Therefore,
it is the body that limits and
conserves its place, not the place
that limits and conserves the body.</p>

<p>This conclusion is confirmed by
the manner in which our knowledge
of place is acquired. Our perception
of the place of a body is caused,
not by the place, but by the body,
which acts upon our senses from
different points of its surface, and
depicts in our organs the figure of
its limits. This figure, therefore, is
the figure of the place only inasmuch
as it is the figure of the body;
or, in other terms, it is the body itself
that by its limits determines the
limits of its place.</p>

<p>From this it follows that, when a
body is said to be in a place <em>circumscriptively</em>,
we ought to interpret the
phrase, not in the sense that the
body is circumscribed by its place,
as Aristotle and his followers believed,
but in this sense, that the
body circumscribes its place by its
own limits. And for the same reason,
those beings which do not exist
<em>circumscriptively</em> in place (and which
are said to be in place only <em>definitively</em>,
as is the case with created
spirits) are substances which do not
circumscribe any place, because
they have no material terms by
which to mark dimensions in space.</p>

<p>The fourth and last question is a
very difficult one. A great number
of eminent authors maintain with
S. Thomas that real bilocation is intrinsically
impossible; others, on
the contrary, hold, with Suarez and
Bellarmine, that it is possible.
Without pretending to decide the
question, we will simply offer to our
reader a few remarks on the arguments
adduced against the possibility
of real bilocation.</p>

<p>The strongest of those arguments
is, in our opinion, the following.
The real bilocation of a body requires
the real bilocation of all its
parts, and therefore is impossible
unless each primitive element of
the body can have two distinct,
real ubications at the same time
the one natural and the other supernatural.
But it is impossible for
a simple and primitive element to
have two distinct, real ubications at
the same time, for two distinct, real
ubications presuppose two distinct,
real terminations of the virtuality
of God’s immensity, and two distinct,
real terminations are intrinsically
impossible without two distinct,
real terms. It is therefore
evident that one point of matter
cannot mark out two points in
space, and that real bilocation is
impossible.</p>

<p>To evade this argument, it might
be said that it is not evident, after
all, that the same real term cannot
correspond to two terminations.
For to duplicate the ubication of
an element of matter means to cause
the same element, which is <em>here</em>
present to God, to be <em>there</em> also
present to God. Now this requires
only the correspondence of the material
point to two distinct virtualities
of divine immensity. Is this a
contradiction? The correspondence
to one virtuality is certainly
not the negation of the correspondence
to another; hence it is not
necessary to concede that there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_802" id="Page_802">[802]</a></span>
contradiction between the two. It
may be added that the supernatural
possibility of bilocation seems to be
established by many facts we read
in ecclesiastical history and the
lives of saints, as also by the dogma
of the Real Presence of Our Lord’s
Body in so many different places in
the Sacrament of the Eucharist.
Lastly, although real bilocation is
open to many objections on account
of its supernatural character,
yet these objections can be sufficiently
answered, as may be seen in
Suarez, in part. 3, disp. 48, sec. 4.</p>

<p>These reasons may have a certain
degree of probability; nevertheless,
before admitting that a point of
matter can mark two points in
space at the same time, it is necessary
to ascertain whether a single
real term can terminate two virtualities
of God’s immensity. This is
a thing which can scarcely be conceived;
for two distinct ubications
result from two distinct terminations;
and it is quite evident, as we
have already intimated, that there
cannot be two distinct terminations
if there be not two distinct terms.
For the virtualities of divine immensity
are not distinct from one
another in their entity, but only by
extrinsic denomination, inasmuch as
they are distinctly terminated by
distinct extrinsic terms. Therefore,
a single extrinsic term cannot correspond
to two distinct virtualities
of divine immensity; whence it follows
that a single material point
cannot have two distinct ubications.</p>

<p>As to the facts of ecclesiastical
history above alluded to, it might
be answered that their nature is not
sufficiently known to base an argument
upon them. Did any saints
ever <em>really</em> exist in two places? For
aught we know, they may have existed
really in one place, and only
phenomenically in another. Angels
occupy no place, and have no
bodies; and yet they appeared in
place, and showed themselves in
bodily forms, which need not have
been more than phenomenal. Disembodied
souls have sometimes appeared
with phenomenal bodies.
Why should we be bound to admit
that when saints showed themselves
in two places, their body was not
phenomenal in one and real only
in the other?</p>

<p>The fact of the Real Presence of
Christ’s body in the Blessed Sacrament,
though much insisted upon
by some authors, seems to have no
bearing on the present question.
For, our Lord’s body in the Eucharist
has no immediate connection
with place, but is simply denominated
by the place of the sacramental
species, as S. Thomas
proves; for it is there <i lang="la">ad modum
substantiæ</i>, as the holy doctor incessantly
repeats, and not <i lang="la">ad modum
corporis locati</i>.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Hence, S. Thomas
himself, notwithstanding the real
presence of Christ’s body on our
altars, denies without fear the possibility
of real bilocation properly
so called.</p>

<p>Though not all the arguments
brought against real bilocation
are equally conclusive, some of
them are very strong, and seem
unanswerable. Suarez, who tried
to answer them, did not directly
solve them, but only showed that
they would prove too much if they
were applied to the mystery of the
Real Presence. The inference is
true; but S. Thomas and his followers
would answer that their arguments
do not apply to the Eucharistic
mystery.</p>

<p>One of those arguments is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_803" id="Page_803">[803]</a></span>
following: If a man were simultaneously
in two places, say, in Rome
and in London, his quantity would
be separated from itself; for it
would be really distant from itself,
and relatively opposed to itself. But
this is impossible. For how can
there be real opposition without
two real terms?</p>

<p>Some might answer, that a man
bilocated is one term <em>substantially</em>,
but equivalent to two <em>locally</em>, and
that it is not his substance nor his
quantity that is distant from itself,
but only one of his locations as
compared with the other. But we
do not think that this answer is
satisfactory. For, although distance
requires only two <em>local</em> terms,
we do not see how there can be
<em>local</em> terms without two distinct
beings. One and the same being
cannot be actually in two places
without having two contrary modes:
and this is impossible; for two contraries
cannot coexist in the same
subject, as S. Thomas observes.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>Another of those arguments is
based on the nature of quantity.
One and the same quantity cannot
occupy two distinct places. For
quantity is the formal cause of the
occupation of place, and no formal
cause can have two adequate formal
effects. Hence, as one body
has but one quantity, so it can occupy
but one place.</p>

<p>This argument cannot be evaded
by saying that the quantity which
is the formal cause of occupation
is not the quantity of the mass, but
the quantity of the volume. In fact,
the duplication of the volume
would duplicate the place; but the
volume cannot be duplicated unless
each material term at the surface
of the body can acquire two
ubications. Now, this is impossible,
as a single term cannot correspond
to two extrinsic terminations
of divine immensity, as already remarked.
Hence, the quantity of
volume cannot be duplicated in
distinct places without duplicating
also the mass of the body&mdash;that is,
there cannot be two places without
two bodies.</p>

<p>A third argument is as follows:
If a body were bilocated, it would
be circumscribed and not circumscribed.
Circumscribed, as is admitted,
because its dimensions
would coextend with its place; not
circumscribed, because it would
also exist entirely outside of its
place.</p>

<p>This argument, in our opinion,
is not valid; because it is not
the place that circumscribes the
body, but the body that circumscribes
its own place. Hence, if a
body were bilocated, it would circumscribe
two places, and would
be within both alike. It will be
said that this, too, is impossible.
We incline very strongly to the
same opinion, but not on the
strength of the present argument.</p>

<p>A fourth argument is, that if a
thing can be bilocated, there is no
reason why it could not be trilocated
and multilocated. But, if so,
then one man could be so replicated
as to form by himself alone
two battalions fighting together;
and consequently such a man might
in one battalion be victorious, and
in the other cut to pieces; in one
place suffer intense cold, and in another
excessive heat; in one pray,
and in another swear. The absurdity
of these conclusions shows the
absurdity of the assumption from
which they follow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_804" id="Page_804">[804]</a></span></p>

<p>This argument is by no means
formidable. Bilocation and multilocation
are a duplication and multiplication
of the place, not of the
substance. Now, the principle of
operation in man is his substance,
whilst his place is only a condition
of the existence and of the movements
of his body. Accordingly,
those passions of heat and cold,
and such like, which depend on local
movement, can be multiplied
and varied with the multiplication
of the places, but the actions which
proceed from the intrinsic faculties
of man can not be thus varied and
multiplied. Hence, from the multilocation
of a man, it would not follow
that he, as existing in one place,
could slay himself as existing in another
place, nor that he could
pray in one and swear in another.
After all, bilocation and multilocation
would, by the hypothesis, be
the effect of supernatural intervention,
and, as such, they would be
governed by divine wisdom. Hence
it is unreasonable to assume the
possibility of such ludicrous contingencies
as are mentioned in the
argument; for God does not lend
his supernatural assistance to foster
what is incongruous or absurd.</p>

<p>To conclude. It seems to us
that those among the preceding
arguments which have a decided
weight against the possibility of
real bilocation, are all radically
contained in this, that one and the
same element of matter cannot have
at the same time two modes of
being, of which the one entails the
exclusion of the other. Now, the
mode of being by which an element
is constituted in a point, <em>A</em>, excludes
the mode of being by which it
would be constituted in another
point, <em>B</em>. For, since the ubication
in <em>A</em> is distant from the ubication
in <em>B</em>, the two ubications are not
only distinct, but relatively opposed,
as S. Thomas has remarked:
<i lang="la">Distinguuntur ad invicem secundum
aliquam loci contrarietatem</i>; and
therefore they cannot belong both
together to the same subject. On
the other hand, we have also
proved that a single element cannot
terminate two distinct virtualities
of God’s immensity, because
no distinct virtualities can be conceived
except with reference to
distinct extrinsic terms. Hence,
while the element in question has
its ubication in <em>A</em>, it is utterly incapable
of any other ubication.
To admit that one and the same
material point can terminate two
virtualities of divine immensity,
seems to us as absurd as to admit
that one and the same created
being is the term of two distinct
creations. For this reason we
think, with S. Thomas, that bilocation,
properly so called, is an impossibility.</p>

<h3>AN EPISODE.</h3>

<p>The caption “episode” is advisedly
adopted, inasmuch as we
are going to transcribe only one
short chapter from a large manuscript
of several hundred pages containing
“The Life of Sixtus V.”</p>

<p>However, it is to be regretted that
such a life is not published. For
it would reveal unto us the <em>man</em>,
whereas Ranke and Hübner describe
only the <em>prince</em>.</p>

<p>Sixtus V. fell into that mistake,
which has proved disastrous to
many popes, and has afforded a
weapon, however silly and easily
broken, yet a real weapon to the
enemies of the Papacy&mdash;nepotism.
The charge is exaggerated of course:
in fact, what our enemies assert to
have been the universal failing of
all the popes, the true historian
avers to have been the mistake of a
few, whereas the examples of heroic
detachment from kindred given by
the vast majority of the Pontiffs are
wonderful. S. Gregory the Great
says, “better there should be a
scandal than the truth were suppressed”;
and surely the church
needs no better defence than the
truth. For the present purpose, suffice
it to quote the Protestant Ranke,
who, after a thorough investigation
of the subject, gave it as his honest
opinion that only <em>three</em> or <em>four</em> popes
are really liable to the charge of
nepotism. It is pleasant to be able
to quote such an opinion of an eminent
non-Catholic writer against
scores of wilful men, who sharpen
their weapons and discharge their
shafts, not after honest study and
investigation, but merely on the
promptings of blind hatred.</p>

<p>Pope Sixtus V. was the second
son of Piergentile Peretti of Montalto.</p>

<p>His eldest brother was Prospero,
who married Girolama of Tullio
Mignucci, and died <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1560, without
issue.</p>

<p>Camilla was his only sister. She
was led to the altar by Gianbattista
Mignucci, brother to Girolama. To
an exquisite correctness of judgment,
and great generosity of heart,
she joined a quick apprehension
of the importance of circumstances
by which she might find herself
suddenly encompassed. The <em>Anonimo</em>
of the <cite>Capitoline Memoirs</cite> says
that when Camilla was unexpectedly
raised from the obscure life of a
<i lang="it">contadino’s</i> wife to the rank of a Roman
lady, she was not stunned, but
felt perfectly at ease, whilst her society
was coveted by the choicest
circles of the nobility. Cardinal
d’Ossat, in his <cite>Letters</cite>, informs us that
she was greatly esteemed and dearly
beloved by Louise de Lorraine,
queen-dowager of the gifted but
perverse Henry III. of France.
The works of her munificence and
public charity in her native Grottamare
are many, and enduring to
our day.</p>

<p>Father Felix Peretti had already
mounted all the rounds but one
of ecclesiastical preferment&mdash;the
cardinal’s hat was almost within his
reach. He was a bishop, and occupied
some of the highest offices
in the <i lang="it">Curia Romana</i>. He thought
the time had come to satisfy a long-felt
desire&mdash;the ennoblement of his
family. Hence, in 1562, he called
his sister to Rome, having obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_806" id="Page_806">[806]</a></span>
a sovereign’s rescript by which his
brother was allowed to change his
name, Mignucci, into that of Peretti.
On the 17th day of May, 1570,
Pius V. raised Mgr. Felix Peretti
to the dignity of cardinal. Thenceforward
he is more generally known
in history as Cardinal Montalto,
from the place of his nativity.</p>

<p>Thus, even previous to his brother-in-law’s
elevation, Gianbattista
Mignucci enters Rome transformed
into Peretti, to join his wife and their
two children Francis and Mary.</p>

<p><i lang="la">O fallaces cogitationes nostras!</i>
The friar hopes his name, made illustrious
by himself, will not become
extinct; but he is mistaken;
if recorded on the tablets of time it
will not surely be by a worldly alliance,
which is doomed to a dishonored
extinction. The church will
inscribe the Peretti name and fame
on the adamantine records of her
immortality.</p>

<p>Verily, if we understand aright
the professions of recluses, the Franciscan
friar should have done away
with his relations for ever; at least,
so far as not to allow himself to be
blinded by human affection. He
should have remembered that he
was under no obligation to them,
that from his earliest boyhood he
had been taken in hand by churchmen,
and that only through scientific
and moral resources acquired
in a friary he had received strength
to climb up so high in the ecclesiastical
hierarchy. The world is keen
in its observations, and Peretti did
not escape its strictures, seldom
erring when established on principles
and facts universally admitted,
and moreover sanctioned by divine
teaching. And has not <em>the</em> example
been set for those who profess
the perfection of evangelical counsels
of how they should behave towards
their kindred?</p>

<p>Be that as it may, Fra Felice paid
dearly for his ambition.</p>

<p>His niece, Donna Maria Peretti,
was soon married, and a dowry
granted her from the revenues of
her uncle of three thousand crowns
a year. Mary’s children, two boys
and two girls, became allied to
some of the most distinguished families
of Italy, and the plebeian
blood of Peretti mingled with that
of the simon-pure aristocracy. Out
of this issue arose eminent men
who did honor to cross and sword.
But enough of this branch of the
friar’s adoption.</p>

<p>About the time of Mgr. Felix
Peretti’s elevation to the cardinalate,
his nephew Francesco was
wedded to Donna Vittoria Accoramboni
of Gubbio, in Umbria,
praised by the <i lang="it">Gentiluomo</i>, Aquitano
(vol. ii., b. vi.), as “a woman of
high mind, of great beauty of soul
and body.” Her family still exists
in Italy, and a lineal descendant
occupies important posts in the
household of Pius IX.. Her suitors
had been many and of princely
caste; among the rest Paolo Giordano
Orsini, Duke of Bracciano,
formerly married to the sister of
the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Francesco
Medici. Paolo, <i lang="la">homo ruptus
disruptusque</i>, stands charged in history
with the murder of this his
former wife, the accomplished Isabella,
daughter of Cosmo, whom he
strangled on the 16th of July, 1576.
But Vittoria’s father cut short all
suits, and gave her in holy wedlock
to Francesco Peretti, nephew of the
mysterious cardinal, whose future
elevation to the papal throne was
held <i lang="la">in petto</i> by every discerning
Roman.</p>

<p>However, Vittoria’s mother gave
her consent reluctantly; for wearing
the ducal coronet seemed preferable
to being the prospective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_807" id="Page_807">[807]</a></span>
niece of the sovereign&mdash;<i lang="it">uccello in
tasca è meglio che due in frasca</i><a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> the
shrewd Italian lady thought. But
whereas Lady Accoramboni forgot
that the Orsini family owed their
power to Nicholas III. (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1277-80),
an Orsini by birth, who, by the
lever of nepotism, had raised an
already celebrated family to the
highest standing of European nobility,
her husband, on the other
hand, said to her: “Can’t you see?
Vittoria will be the head of a new,
powerful family!” Still Lady Accoramboni
did not see it, and the
loss of the coronet rankled for ever
in her breast.</p>

<p>Indeed, in these days when tales
of fiction are the almost exclusive
reading of the youth of both sexes,
an accomplished writer might weave
out of the following events a story
of stirring interest; not sensational,
indeed, but freighted with most salutary
lessons.</p>

<p>Vittoria Accoramboni Peretti had
three brothers:</p>

<p>Ottavio was, through the recommendation
of Cardinal Peretti, nominated
by the Duke of Urbino
for, and by Gregory XIII. appointed
to, the bishopric of Fossombrone.
He adorned his see with all the
virtues becoming a scholar, a gentleman,
a patriot, and a true apostolic
prelate.</p>

<p>Giulio became one of the private
household of Cardinal Alessandro
Sforza, by whom he was held in
great favor, and employed as confidential
secretary.</p>

<p>Marcello was outlawed for his
misdeeds, and a price set on his
head. But Cardinal Peretti obtained
his pardon; yet leave to return
to Rome was not granted to
him.</p>

<p>“A wise woman buildeth her
house: but the foolish will pull
down with her hands that also
which is built,” saith the Wise Man.
The house of Francesco and Maria
Peretti <em>was</em> built, and it was the
home of comfort and honor, enclosing
within its walls the choicest
gifts of the world; and of its brightest
ornament, the Lady Vittoria
Peretti, it might be said she was
the cynosure of Roman society.
The evening <i lang="it">conversazioni</i> drew the
<i lang="fr">élite</i> of Rome, graced as they were
by the presence of the cardinal,
who, with his proverbial regularity,
would attend them for a definite
length of time. His wise sayings,
dignity of deportment, and agreeableness
of manners, mingled with
an independence of character that
made him almost redoubtable at
the Roman court, enhanced the
charm of the family circle. Young
prelates prized highly the privilege
of being admitted amongst the visitors.
The spacious halls of the
Villa Negroni were adorned with
paintings and statuary, and the noblest
specimens of the art of painting;
the gardens were reckoned
the most tasteful of those of any
princely family in Rome. While
he was scrupulous in his attention
to consistorial meetings, and the
affairs of the <i lang="it">Curia Romana</i> over
which he was appointed, Cardinal
Peretti never gave his time to what
he would consider frivolous etiquette.
His library, his gardens,
afforded him all the relaxation he
needed; his life was most exemplary
and devout. Happy, indeed,
was the home built by such hands;
but a foolish woman pulled it down!</p>

<p>At the depth of night, not many
months after Vittoria had been
wedded, a note is hurriedly carried
by a chambermaid to Francesco;
it had been left at the entry by a
well-known friend, and the messenger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_808" id="Page_808">[808]</a></span>
had left immediately. It was
written by Marcello, who at times
entered the city under protection
of night, or of some leaders of political
factions, with which the city
swarmed&mdash;barons and princes who,
under the mild government of Gregory
XIII., had everything their
own way.</p>

<p>The letter summoned Francesco
to repair at once to the Esquiline
hill, there to meet some gentlemen
on a business the nature whereof
could not be entrusted to paper,
and admitted of no delay. Hurriedly
does the devoted man dress
himself, and, his sword under his
arm, forces his way through the
servants who beseech him to halt,
disentangles himself from his wife
and mother, who, prostrated before
him, cling to his knees, begging of
him not to trust himself to the outlawed
Marcello. In vain! Preceded
by a servant with torch in
hand, no sooner had he reached the
brow of the Quirinal than the contents
of three arquebuses were
lodged in his breast; whereupon
four men fell upon him, and finished
him with their stilettos.
“Thus,” says an old historian, “fell
a youth whose only crime was to
be the husband of a most beautiful
woman.” Another chronicler calls
Francesco <i lang="it">Cale e di gran correttezza
di costumi</i>.</p>

<p>The commotion in the family
when the ensanguined and ghastly
corpse was carried home can easily
be imagined. The lamentations of
the women and the uproar of the
servants awoke the cardinal, who
slept in a distant apartment&mdash;his
palace, the Villa Negrone, as mentioned
above, and by that name
known to modern tourists, extending
from the Esquiline (Santa Maria
Maggiore) to the Piazza de’ Termini.
It is said that on hearing
the dreadful news Montalto fell
upon his knees, and prayed God to
grant rest to the soul of his nephew,
and to himself fortitude, such as
became his character and dignity.
His presence not only brought, but
forced calm on the distracted
household. On the next day the
Holy Father was to hold a Consistory,
and, contrary to the expectation
of all, Cardinal Montalto was
at his post, as usual, among the
first. His colleagues offer their
condolence, which he accepts with
a resignation almost akin to stoicism.
But when he approaches the throne
to give his opinion on the matters
debated, and the pope, with moist
eyes and greatly moved, expresses
a heartfelt sympathy in the cardinal’s
affliction, pledging his word
that the perpetrators shall be visited
with summary and condign punishment,
Montalto thanks the Pontiff
for his kind sympathy, protests
that he has already forgiven the
murderers, and begs that all proceedings
may be stayed, lest the
innocent should be punished for the
guilty. Having thus disposed of
the matter, he proceeds with his
wonted calmness to discuss that
which was before the Consistory.</p>

<p>Referring to this impassiveness
of Peretti, the pope remarked, with
an ominous shake of the head, to
his nephew, Cardinal San Sisto,
“Indeed, Montalto is a great friar!”
And those of Peretti’s own times,
and subsequent historians, seem to
have had an insight of his mind
and motives. In the sober language
of Ranke, “His character
does not appear to have been so
guileless as it is occasionally represented.
As early as 1574 he is described
as learned and prudent, but
also crafty and malignant. He was
doubtless gifted with remarkable
self-control. When his nephew was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_809" id="Page_809">[809]</a></span>
assassinated, he was himself the
person who requested the pope
to discontinue the investigation.
This quality, which was admired
by all, very probably contributed
to his election” to the papal throne.</p>

<p>Those among our readers who
have resided among Italians, and
especially in Rome, need not be
told of the tremendous excitement
which seized the holy city as it
awoke on that dreadful morning.
Cardinal Peretti of Montalto became
the observed of all observers;
nobles and prelates thronged the
avenues to his villa to assure him
of their loyalty and condolence;
very few, indeed, as the world goes,
honestly and sincerely; many simply
from custom; almost all, however,
moved by a motive of curiosity
to see how the “Picenian packhorse”
bore the great calamity,
and, above all, what feelings he
would betray towards Paolo Giordano
Orsini, to whom the finger of
public opinion already pointed as
the murderer of Vittoria’s husband.
By some manœuvre of the “gossiping
committee” the day and the
hour on which even Giordano
would present himself at the palace
became known, and the throng at
the drawing-rooms was exceedingly
great. When the murderer stood
face to face before his victim’s best
friend and only avenger, not the least
twitch in the cardinal’s nerves, not
a falter in the voice, nor the slightest
change of color betrayed the
conflict in his soul. He received
Orsini’s treacherous sympathy as he
had received the truest expressions
of condolence. Peretti stood there,
the prince, not the avenger. Even
the accursed soul of Giordano was
lost in wonderment; he became
embarrassed and disconcerted, and
he was reported to have exclaimed
as he re-entered his carriage&mdash;“Montalto
is a great friar; no mistake
about it!” (Montalto è un
gran frate; chi ne dubita!)</p>

<p>Vittoria had no children. Hence,
after the funeral, the cardinal sent
her home to her mother, bestowing
upon her costly gifts, and giving
her the jewels, plate, and precious
articles of furniture and apparel,
which had been the bridal presents
of husband and friends. <i lang="la">Ora ti
credo</i>, said Pasquino to Marforio, in
allusion to Montalto’s forbearance
and disinterested magnanimity.</p>

<p>The sequel to this tragedy is so
thrilling in interest, so characteristic
of the times about which we
write, and must have taxed the
feelings of the future pope so much,
that a succinct account thereof cannot
but prove interesting to our
readers.</p>

<p>Gregory XIII. urged with energy
and perseverance the necessary inquests
to ferret out the murderers
of Francesco Peretti. But wily old
Giordano Orsini (he was on the
other side of fifty) knew how to
baffle the requisitions of justice, by
no means a difficult task in those
lawless times. He sent the waiting-maid
to Bracciano, to be protected
by the feudal immunities of
the Orsini castle. Vittoria and her
mother were sheltered in Rome in
the Orsini palace. The feudal
power was still great in those days,
and often a franchise was secured
to the premises of Roman nobles by
foreign princes, to the infinite annoyance
of the local sovereign, and
often clogging the workings of justice.
One Cesare Pallentieri, an
outlawed ruffian, was then bribed
to write to the governor of Rome
avowing himself the plotter of
Peretti’s death to revenge himself
for personal injuries received at that
gentleman’s hands. Nobody believed
the story; and the verdict of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_810" id="Page_810">[810]</a></span>
public opinion was sanctioned when,
in February, 1582, Mancino, the
bearer of the fatal note, declared,
under oath and without compulsion,
that the whole plot had been woven
by Vittoria’s mother; that the servant-maid
had been made privy to it;
and moreover revealed the names of
two of the emissaries, it being well
known in whose pay they bore
arms, although he stated no employer’s
name.</p>

<p>At this stage of the proceedings
Cardinal Montalto, with persevering
endeavors with the pope and
the interposition of friends, stayed
all prosecutions, and on December
13, 1583, obtained from the sovereign
pardon for Mancino, who was,
however, banished from Rome, and
relegated&mdash;<em>interned</em>, in modern parlance&mdash;to
Fermo, his native city,
being forbidden to quit it under
penalty of death. But it was too
evident that there was a trifling
with justice, and in the uncertainties
between which public opinion
seemed to fluctuate, wiser counsels
attempted to vindicate the necessity
of a just retribution. Hence, at the
instance of several cardinals and
of the Spanish ambassador, Gregory
was prevailed upon to confine
Vittoria to the castle Sant’ Angelo,
and by a special decree forbade her
marrying Paolo Giordano Orsini,
unless by a reserved dispensation
from himself or his successor,
under attaintment of felony. However,
after two years of imprisonment
she was declared innocent of
any share in or knowledge of the
plot, and discharged. This happened
on the very day of Gregory’s
death, April 10, 1585. Still Orsini
could not wed her, because of the
forbidding clause in the pope’s
order. But some accommodating
casuist came to the rescue, and
averred that the defunct pope’s
brief was binding no more. Whereupon
the duke hastened, by special
couriers on post-horses, to notify
the good Bishop of Fossombrone of
his intended alliance with Vittoria,
and to solicit his gracious consent.
Mgr. Ottavio refused his assent decidedly,
nor would he allow himself
to change his refusal, although
Orsini despatched messenger after
messenger, anxious, as he was, to
accomplish his purpose ere a new
pope was elected. But the new
pope was elected far sooner than
the duke or any one else expected,
and in defiance of the express command
of the defunct pontiff, and in
shameless disregard of the feelings
of the new sovereign, the very
morning on which Cardinal Peretti,
Vittoria’s uncle, was proclaimed,
she was wedded to Paolo Orsini,
Duke of Bracciano. Rome was bewildered
at the announcement; and
although no one could guess what
the consequences of the rash act
might be, or how the pope would
show his displeasure, because Fra
Felice never made any one the
confidant of his thoughts, yet the
general impression was that sooner
or later the duke would be made
to pay dearly for his daring and
reckless disregard of the commonest
principles of decency.</p>

<p>Rome was on the alert. Duke
Orsini is admitted to offer his obeisance
to the Pontiff Sixtus V. amid
the solemn assembly of cardinals,
foreign envoys, and Roman princes
and senators; the expression of
his liege words, his prostration at
the sovereign’s throne, and his
courtly homage meet with the simple
response of a look from Sixtus.
That look gave rise to the most
clashing interpretations in the observing
minds of the beholders; it
was a look of benignity, weighty
with authority, crushing with power,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_811" id="Page_811">[811]</a></span>
such as to subdue at once the
haughty and defiant princely ruffian.
From that moment Paolo Orsini
never raised his head; his day was
gone. Within a few days a sovereign
decree, worded as only Sixtus V.
knew how to pen them, in terms at
which no one would dare to cavil,
Orsini was forbidden to shelter outlaws.
The duke solicited an audience;
of what occurred at that
meeting no one could ever surmise;
but Orsini found no more charm in
what he could heretofore call <em>his</em>
Rome. Accordingly, within two
months after the inauguration of
Sixtus’ pontificate, he left the papal
city. In sooth, he was an exile,
voluntary, as if by courtesy. Great
was the bitterness galling Vittoria’s
heart, and she was pitied by all&mdash;the
victim of a mother’s rash ambition,
she had to flee that Rome
where she could still have reigned
the queen of society for her beauty,
her great gifts, and close relationship
to the sovereign. Donna Camilla
reigned in her stead. Nor was
this all. The handsome, youthful,
accomplished niece of Sixtus was
then the slavish, unhappy wife of a
cumbrous quinquagenarian prince,
covered with loathsome blotches
from the sole of his feet to the
crown of his head, the penalty of
his dissipations; one of his legs so
ulcered with cancer that it had
swollen to the size of a man’s waist,
and had to be kept bandaged (the
chronicler says), with slices of
<em>some other animal’s meat</em>, that the
acrid humor would not eat into <em>his
own</em> live flesh&mdash;a fretful old debauchee,
overbearing, universally loathed
for his lecherous habits, hated
for his cruelties, and made intractable
by a conscience gnawed by
despair.</p>

<p>Poor Vittoria! On their way to
Salò, near the lake of Garda in
Lombardy, her husband, consumed
by ulcers and tortures of soul, died
suddenly whilst being bled in his
arm!</p>

<p>Forlorn Vittoria! the first paroxysm
of grief being over, raised a
pistol to her head, but it was happily
snatched from her in time by
her brother Giulio, and she was
spared a violent, unprepared, and
cowardly death! Thus left alone,
unprotected in her beauty and
youth, she was at the mercy of
Ludovico Orsini, her husband’s
cousin, who despised her on account
of the great disparity of
their birth. Her late husband had
indeed bequeathed to her one hundred
thousand crowns, besides silver
plate, horses, carriages, and
jewelry without stint. All this
Ludovico coveted, and stepped forward
under pretence of protecting
the rights of Flaminio Orsini, Giordano’s
son by his former wife;
but unable to break the will, he
summoned one Liverotto Paolucci
of Camerino to come to Padua&mdash;whither
Vittoria had repaired immediately,
and, aided by such as he
might chose, to murder Vittoria
and her brother! The bloody ruffian
answered the summons, and
entering the princess’ apartment
through a window, in the depth of
the night, his men fell at first upon
Giulio, and into his breast discharged
the contents of three
muskets. The victim crawled to
his sister’s room and crouched under
her bed. There he was finished
with <em>seventy-three</em> thrusts of white
arms, encouraged all the time
by Vittoria, anxiously repeating&mdash;“Forgive,
Giulio; beg God’s mercy,
and willingly accept death for
his sake.”</p>

<p>It is recorded in the life of her
sainted brother, the Bishop of Fossombrone,
that, upon the death of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_812" id="Page_812">[812]</a></span>
the duke, he without delay wrote to
his sister, exhorting her to amend
her life, and devote herself to
works of atonement and piety;
for, said he, “your days will not
be many.” And we have it from
authenticated records of those times
that she did truly repent of her
worldliness, and, having placed herself
under the protection of the Republic
of Venice, retired to Padua,
where she lived in great retirement,
dividing her time between
practices of devotion in the church,
deeds of charity, and protracted
orisons at home. She also begged
of the Pope leave to repair to
Rome, the asylum of the wretched,
and spend the remainder of her life
in a convent, for which purpose
her generous uncle had signed a
remittance of five hundred gold
crowns on the very day he received
the sad account of her
death. Her brother, the bishop,
had so strong a presentiment, some
say a revelation from above, of the
impending catastrophe, that on the
22d of December he ordered special
prayers to be offered by the
clergy of his diocese in her behalf.</p>

<p>And she <em>did</em> fall a victim to Ludovico’s
dagger on the 22d of that
month!</p>

<p>After Giulio had breathed his
last, bathed in his own blood,
Count Paganello, one of Liverotto’s
band, took hold of the devoted
woman by both arms, and
holding her in the kneeling posture
in which she had been found at
her prayers, bade one of his bravoes
to tear open her dress on the
right side, whereupon she indignantly
protested that she should be
allowed to die in her dress, as it
became an honest woman and the
<em>wife of Giordano Orsini</em>! The
brute plunged a stiletto into her
bosom, and kept trepanning towards
the left side in search of the
heart. She offered no resistance,
but during the horrid butchery of
her form she ceased not repeating,
“I pardon you, even as I beg of
God to forgive me.… Jesus!…
Jesus!… Mercy and forgiveness!”
And with these words
of forgiveness dying on her lips she
fell lifeless on the floor.</p>

<p>Thus ended, by a cruel death,
yet heroically met, one of the most
remarkable women of her time&mdash;a
woman renowned for her admirable
beauty, talents, and misguided
ambition. Having been the pet of
European society, she died almost
an outlaw; the niece of Pope Sixtus V.,
she died without a home of
her own; a lamentable instance of
the ignominious end awaiting those
who have been endowed by a kind
Providence with the noblest of
gifts, but have made a wrong use
of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_813" id="Page_813">[813]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE CROSS IN THE DESERT.</h3>

<p>Some few years ago a pilgrim
sailed across the blue waters of the
Mediterranean, smitten with the love
of the cross, and bearing in his hand
“the banner with the strange device.”</p>

<p>It was a lovely summer’s evening.
The fierce African sun was
sinking to his rest behind the hill
on which the ruins of the old city
of Hippo stand; and as the pilgrim,
who had climbed to its summit,
stood gazing around him, the glow
of the western sky bathed his dusty
garments in a golden light, touching
the ruins with a splendor of its
own, and lighting up the sea, that
heaved gently down below, with
the brightness of amber and gold.</p>

<p>This, then, was all that remained
of the proud old city whose name
Augustine had made famous to the
end of time!</p>

<p>These crumbling walls were once
the school where he taught, the
halls where his youthful eloquence
fired the hearts of the great scholars
of the day; here were the baths
where he lounged in his idle hours
with pleasure-loving companions;
here the streets where every day he
came and went from Monica’s quiet
home to the busy haunts of learning,
of sophistry, and science; here
was the place where she had wept
so bitterly over him, the spot where
that salutary fountain of a mother’s
tears had had its source; here
he had sinned; hence he had gone
forth in search of truth, and, having
found it, hither he had come
back, transformed into a confessor
and a doctor of the church; here,
finally, he died, full of years,
leaving behind him a name great
amongst the greatest saints whom
the church has raised to her altars.</p>

<p>And what now remained to Africa
of this light which had shed
such glory on her church? Where
did his memory live? And the faith
that he had practised&mdash;whither had
it fled?</p>

<p>The pilgrim sat down upon a
stone, and, after indulging in reflections
such as these for some time,
he rose and descended slowly towards
the plain.</p>

<p>Was it a fancy born of recent
musings, or did he hear a voice issuing
from the massive fragment
of a wall which still supported a
majestic dome, once probably the
thermæ of the luxurious and
wealthy citizens of Hippo? Did
he really see a light burning, or
was it an hallucination born of the
mystic hour and the suggestive
surroundings? He drew closer,
looked in, and beheld two white-bearded
Arabs placing each a light
on the highest point of the wall.
Was it some idolatrous rite, a spell,
or an incantation they were performing?</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” inquired
the pilgrim.</p>

<p>“We are burning lights to the
great Christian,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Who is that? What is his
name?”</p>

<p>“We do not know it; but we
honor him because our fathers
taught us to do so.”</p>

<p>So, then, the memory of Augustine
survived in the land, though
his name had perished!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_814" id="Page_814">[814]</a></span></p>

<p>The pilgrim murmured a prayer
to the great Christian, as the Arabs
called him, and turned away, carrying
in his heart a hope that he
had not known an hour ago&mdash;a
hope that Augustine was still
watching for the resurrection of
the cross in the land of his birth,
and hastening its advent by his intercession
at the throne of Him
whom he described as “patient because
he is eternal.”</p>

<p>It is a fact, as striking as it is
consoling, that within the last few
years the faith has been making rapid
conquests amidst the barbarous nations,
where in the days of S. Augustine,
and long after, it flourished
so magnificently. Perhaps it is
more surprising that this result
should not have been universal after
nearly half a century of the
rule of a Catholic power; but the
mistaken policy of the French government,
and, alas! we must add,
the evil example of the French
themselves, instead of breaking
down existing barriers, have raised
new and insurmountable ones
against the spread of Christianity
amongst the conquered tribes.
France proclaimed her intention
of not alone tolerating, but protecting,
Islamism throughout her
African dominion. She carried
this policy so far for many years
that it was made punishable by
French law to convert a Mussulman
to the Catholic faith, whilst,
on the other hand, it was perfectly
lawful for any number of Catholics
to turn Mussulmans. The priests
who went out as missionaries were
thwarted at every step by the
French authorities. “Our adversaries,
the men who worry us and
stand in the way of our making
converts, are not the Arabs or even
their marabouts,” said one of
these devoted men to us only a
few days ago; “it is our own countrymen,
Frenchmen calling themselves
Catholics, <em>whom we have
chiefly</em> to contend against.” And
he went on to describe how, during
the famine of 1867, when the Arabs
were dying like flies all over the
country, the French authorities
were constantly on the alert to
prevent the missionaries baptizing
them, even <i lang="la">in extremis</i>. They actually
sent detachments of spahees
to the various places where the
poor famine-stricken creatures congregated
in greater numbers to die;
and when the priest was seen approaching
them, as they lay gasping
in their agony, the soldiers
rushed forward to stop him from
administering the sacrament of regeneration.
One little missionary
father contrived to outwit the authorities,
however, and, in spite of
the lynx-eyes that were fixed on him,
he managed to baptize numbers
from a little bottle of water hid
under his burnose.</p>

<p>No wonder the Arabs make small
account of men who set such pitiful
store by their religion. They,
call the French “sons of Satan,”
and the French priests and good
Christians among the seculars will
tell you themselves that the name
is well deserved; that the employees
of the government, military and
civil, make the most deplorable impression
on the natives, and by
their lives present a practical example
of all the vices which it is the
boast of civilization to destroy.
They are so untruthful that the
French missionaries declare they
surpass even the Arabs in lies.
The Arab is abstemious by nature,
and the law of the Koran compels
him to the most rigid sobriety; the
Christians give him an example of excesses
in eating and drinking which
excite his disgust and contempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_815" id="Page_815">[815]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a legend current amongst
the Arabs in the French dominions
that on a certain day Mahomet will
arise and precipitate the sons of
Satan into the sea. When a Frenchman,
in answer to this prophecy,
points to the strength of his government,
its enormous resources,
the power of steam, and the monuments
he has built in Algeria, the
Mussulman with grim contempt
replies in his grave, sullen way:
“Look at the ruins of the old Roman
monuments! They were mightier
than any you have raised; and
yet, behold, they lie in ruins throughout
the land, because Allah so willed.
It is written: Allah will cast
you into the sea as he did the Romans.”</p>

<p>All those who can speak from
experience agree that there are no
people so difficult to evangelize as
the Mussulmans; the pure idolater
is comparatively an easy conquest
to the missionary, but it requires
almost the miraculous intervention
of divine grace to make the light
of the Gospel penetrate the stolid
fatalism of the Mahometan.</p>

<p>One of the greatest obstacles to
the reception of truth in the Arab
is the intuitive pride of race which
arms him against the idea of receiving
religious instruction from a race
of men whom he despises with a
scorn which is actually a part of
his religion, and who in their turn
look down on the children of the
desert, and treat their manners and
customs with contempt. In order
to overcome this first obstacle towards
the success of their ministry,
the missionaries conceived the idea
of identifying themselves, as far as
possible, with the natives, adopting
their dress, their manner of eating
and sleeping, and in every way
assimilating outwardly their daily
lives to theirs.</p>

<p>They tried it, and the system has
already worked wonders. How, indeed,
could it be otherwise? If
faith can move mountains, cannot
love melt them? Love, the irresistible,
the conqueror who subdues
all hard things in this hard world&mdash;why
should it fail with these men,
who have human souls like our
own, fashioned after the likeness
of our common God? Just five
years ago a handful of priests,
Frenchmen, gone mad with the
sweet folly of the cross, heard of
how these Arabs could not be persuaded
to receive the message of
Christ crucified, but repulsed every
effort to reach them. They were
seized with a sudden desire to go
and try if they could not succeed
where others had failed; so they offered
themselves to the Archbishop
of Algiers as missionaries in his
diocese. The offer was gladly accepted;
but when the first presented
himself to obtain faculties for
saying Mass in the villages outside
Algiers and in the desert, the archbishop
signed the permission with
the words <i lang="la">visum pro martyrio</i>, and,
handing it to the young apostle,
said: “Do you accept on these conditions?”</p>

<p>“Monseigneur, it is for that I
have come,” was the joyous reply.
And truly, amongst all the perilous
missions which every day lure brave
souls to court the palm of martyrdom,
there is not one where the
chances are more in favor of gaining
it than in this mission of Sahara,
where the burning sun of Africa,
added to material privations that
are absolutely incredible, makes
the life of the most fortunate missionary
a slow and daily martyrdom.
His first task, in preparation
for becoming a missionary, is to
master the language and to acquire
some knowledge of the healing art,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_816" id="Page_816">[816]</a></span>
of herbs and medicine; then he
dons the dress of the Arabs, which,
conforming in all things to their
customs, he does not quit even at
night, but sleeps in it on the ground;
he builds himself a tent like theirs,
and, in order to disarm suspicion,
lives for some time in their midst
without making the least attempt
at converting them; he does not
even court their acquaintance, but
waits patiently for an opportunity
to draw them towards him; this
generally comes in the form of a
sick person whom the stranger offers
to help and very frequently
cures, or at least alleviates, cleanliness
and the action of pure water
often proving the only remedy required.
The patient, in his gratitude,
offers some present, either in
money, stuffs, or eatables, which
the stranger with gentle indignation
refuses. Then follows some such
dialogue as this: “What! you refuse
my thank-offering? Who, then,
pays you?”</p>

<p>“God, the true God of the Christians.
I have left country and
family and home, and all my heart
loves best, for his sake and for his
service; do you think you or any
man living can pay me for this?”</p>

<p>“What are you, then?” demands
the astonished Arab.</p>

<p>“I am a marabout of Jesus
Christ.” And the Mussulman retires
in great wonder as to what sort
of a religion it can be whose marabouts
take neither money nor goods
for their services. He tells the story
to the neighbors, and by degrees
all the sick and maimed of the district
come trooping to the missionary’s
door. He tends them with untiring
charity. Nothing disgusts him;
the more loathsome the ulcers, the
more wretched the sufferer, the more
tenderness he lavishes on them.</p>

<p>Soon his hut is the rendezvous
of all those who have ailments or
wounds for miles round; and though
they entreat him, sometimes on
their knees, to accept some token
of thanks for his services, he remains
inexorable, returning always
the same answer: “I serve the God
of heaven and earth; the kings of
this world are too poor to pay me.”</p>

<p>He leads this life for fifteen
months before taking his vows as a
missionary. When he has bound
himself to the heroic apostleship,
he is in due time ordained, if not
already a priest, and goes forth, in
company with two other priests, to
establish a mission in some given
spot of Sahara or Soodan, these desolated
regions being the appointed
field of their labors. The little
community follows exactly the
same line of conduct in the beginning
of its installation as above described;
they keep strictly aloof
until, by dint of disinterestedness
and of devotion and skilful care of
the sick, they have disarmed the
fierce mistrust of the “true believers,”
and convinced them that they
are not civil functionaries or in
any way connected with the government.
The Arab’s horror of
everybody and of everything emanating
from French headquarters
partakes of the intense character
of his fanaticism in religious matters.
By degrees the natives become
passionately attached to the
foreign marabouts, who have now to
put limits to the gratitude which
would invest them with semi-divine
attributes. The great aim of the
missionaries is of course to get possession
of the children, so as to form
a generation of future missionaries.
Nothing short of this will plant the
cross in Africa, and, while securing
the spiritual regeneration of the
country, restore to that luxuriant
soil its ancient fertility. Once reconciled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_817" id="Page_817">[817]</a></span>
to civilization by Christianity,
those two millions of natives, who
are now in a state of chronic suppressed
rebellion against their conquerors,
would be disarmed and
their energies turned to the cultivation
of the land and the development
of its rich resources by
means of agricultural implements
and science which the French could
impart to them. Nor is it well to
treat with utter contempt the notion
of a successful rebellion in
Algeria. At the present moment
such an event would be probably
impossible; but there is no reason
why it should be so in years hence.
The Arabs are as yet not well provided
with arms and ammunition;
but they are making yearly large
purchases in this line at Morocco
and Tunis, and the study of European
military science is steadily
progressing. The deep-seated hatred
of the Mussulmans for the
yoke of the stranger is moreover as
intense as in the first days of their
bondage; and if even to-morrow,
unprepared as they are materially,
the “holy war” were proclaimed, it
would rouse the population to a man.
The marabouts would get upon
the minarets, and send forth the
call to every son of Mahomet to
arise and fight against the sons of
the devil, proclaiming the talismanic
promise of the Koran: “Every
true believer who falls in the holy
war is admitted at once into the
paradise of Mahomet.” The number
who would call on the prophet
to fulfil the promise would no doubt
be enormous, and the French would
in all human probability remain
masters of the desert; but a kingdom
held on such tenure as this
state of feeling involves is at best
but a sorry conquest. If the Gospel
had been, we do not even say enforced,
but simply encouraged and zealously
taught, by the conquerors, their
position would be a very different
one in Algeria now. After all, there
is no diplomatist like holy church.
“Our little systems have their day”
and fall to pieces one after another,
perishing with the ambitions and
feuds and enthusiasms that gave
them birth, and leave the world
pretty much as they found it; but
the power of the Gospel grows and
endures and fructifies wherever its
divine policy penetrates. No human
legislation, be it ever so wise, can
cope with this divine legislator;
none other can take the sting out
of defeat, can make the conquerors
loved by the conquered, and turn
the chains of captivity from iron to
silk. Even on the lowest ground,
in mere self-interest, governments
would do well to constitute themselves
the standard-bearers of the
King who rules by love, and subdues
the stubborn pride of men
by first winning their hearts. The
supremacy of this power of love is
nowhere more strikingly exemplified
than amidst these barbarous
Arab tribes.</p>

<p>The story of every little dark-eyed
waif sheltered at the Orphanage
of S. Charles, lately established
outside Algiers, would furnish a
volume in itself; but an incident
connected with the admission of
one of them, and related to us a
few days ago by a missionary just
returned, is so characteristic that
we are tempted to relate it. The
archbishop was making a visitation
in the poor villages sixty miles beyond
Algiers; the priest presented
to him a miserable-looking little
object whose parents still lived in a
neighboring desert tribe, but who
had cast off the child because of its
sickliness and their poverty. Could
his lordship possibly get him taken
in as an orphan? The thing was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_818" id="Page_818">[818]</a></span>
not easy; for every spot was full,
and the fact of the parents being
still alive militated against the
claim of the little, forlorn creature.
But the archbishop’s heart was
touched. He said he would arrange
it somehow; let the boy be sent
on to Ben-Aknoun at once. This,
however, was easier said than
done; who would take charge of
him on such a long journey? His
grace’s carriage (a private conveyance
dignified by that name) was
at the door. “Put him in; I will
take him,” he said, looking kindly
at the small face with the great
dark eyes that were staring wistfully
up at him. But the priest and every
one present exclaimed at the idea
of this. The Arabs are proverbial
for the amount of <em>light infantry</em>
which they carry about with them
in their hair and their rags; and
the fact of their presence in myriads
on the person of this little believer
was evident to the naked eye. The
archbishop, however, nothing daunted,
ordered him to be placed in
the carriage; then, finding no one
would obey him, he caught up the
little fellow in his arms, embraced
him tenderly amidst the horrified
protestations of the priest and
others, carried him to the carriage,
seated him comfortably, and then
got in himself and away they drove.
A large crowd had assembled to see
the great marabout depart, and
stood looking on the extraordinary
scene in amazement. A few days
later several of them came to see
the priest, and ask to be instructed
in the religion which works such
miracles in the hearts of men, and
to offer their children to be brought
up Christians.</p>

<p>This Orphanage of S. Charles is
the most precious institution which
Catholic zeal has so far established
in Algiers. It comprises a school
for boys, and one for girls conducted
by nuns. The description of the
life there sounds like some beautiful
old Bible legend. It is a life of
constant privation, toil, and suffering,
both for the fathers and for the
sisters; but the results as regards
the children are so abundant and
consoling that the missionaries are
sometimes moved to exclaim,
“Verily, we have had our reward!”</p>

<p>The full-grown Arab is perhaps
as wretched a specimen of unregenerate
human nature as the
world can furnish. Every vice
seems natural to him, except gluttony,
which he only acquires with
the spurious civilization imported
by his conquerors. He is relentless
and vindictive; false, avaricious,
cruel, and utterly devoid of any idea
of morality; yet the children of
these men and women are like virgin
soil on which no evil seed has
ever fallen. Their docility is marvellous,
their capacity for gratitude
indescribably touching, and their
religious sense deep, lively, and affective.
They accept the teaching
of the missionaries and the nuns as
if piety were an inherited instinct
in them; and the truths of our holy
faith act upon their minds with the
power of seen realities.</p>

<p>One of the fathers told us, as an
instance of this, that the children
were allowed to play in the fruit
garden once when the trees were in
full bearing; and not a single fig,
orange, or any other fruit being
touched, some visitor asked the
children in surprise if they never
pulled any when their superiors
were not looking; but they answered
in evident astonishment:
“Oh! no; God would see us, and
he would be angry!” We quite
agreed with the narrator that such
a general example of obedience
and self-denial from such a principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_819" id="Page_819">[819]</a></span>
might be vainly sought for in
our most carefully-taught schools
in Europe and&mdash;would it be a
calumny to add?&mdash;America. The
children also show a spirit of sacrifice
that is very striking, the girls
especially. If they are ill and
some nauseous medicine is presented
to them, the little things
seize the cup with avidity, and
with a word, such as “For thee,
dear Jesus!” drain it off at once.
They realize so clearly that every
correction imposed on them is for
their good that it is nothing rare to
see them go to the presiding father
or sister and ask to be punished
when they have committed some
little misdemeanor unobserved.
One little mite of six felt very
sulky towards a companion, and,
after a short and vain struggle to
overcome herself, she went to the
nun and begged to be whipped,
“because she could not make the
devil go away.” Their vivid Oriental
imaginations paint all the terrible
and beautiful truths of the faith
in colors that have the living glow
of visible pictures. They have the
tenderest devotion to our Lord in
the Blessed Sacrament, and nothing
pleases them more than to be
allowed to spend their hour of recreation
in prayer before the tabernacle.
Their sense of gratitude
for the blessing of the faith makes
them long with an indescribable
yearning to share it with their people.
All their prayers and little sacrifices
are offered up with this intention.
Those among them who
were old enough to remember the
wretchedness they were rescued
from, speak of it continually with
the most touching gratitude to God
and their instructors. One of their
greatest pleasures is to count over
the good things they have received
from God. A sister overheard two
of them one day summing them up
as follows: “He gives us bread and
the sunshine and a house; he has
preserved us from dying in the
night-time; he prevents the sea
overflowing and drowning us; he
has given us monseigneur and our
mammas [the nuns]; he came on
earth to teach us to be obedient;
he brought us the Gospel; he has
given us the Blessed Virgin to be
our mamma, and then our angels,
and then the Holy Father; he forgives
us our sins; he has given us
sacraments for our soul and body;
he stays always with us in the chapel;
he is keeping our place in
heaven; he looks at us when we
are naughty, and that makes us
sorry, and then he forgives us.”
And so they go on composing canticles
out of their innocent hearts
that must make sweet music in His
ears who so loved the little ones.</p>

<p>The deaths of some of these little
barbarians are as lovely as any
we read of in the lives of the
saints. One of them, who was
baptized by the name of Amelia,
has left a memory that will long
be cherished in Ben-Aknoun. She
was dying of a lingering, terrible
disease; but her sufferings never
once provoked a murmur. She was
as gay as a little bird and as gentle
as a lamb; her only longing was to
see God. “And what will you do
besides in heaven?” asked one of
her companions. “I will walk
about with the angels,” she replied,
“and be on the watch to meet our
mammas when they come to the
beautiful gates.” In her sleep she
used to pray still; many a time
the nuns found her muttering her
rosary with clasped hands while
sleeping the sound sleep of a tired
child. She fought against death
as long as she could, insisting on
getting up and going to the chapel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_820" id="Page_820">[820]</a></span>
where sometimes she would lie exhausted
with pain and weakness on
the step of the altar, breathing her
prayers softly until she dropped
asleep. Her only fear was lest she
should not make her First Communion
before she died; but her extreme
youth (she was not quite
eight years old) was compensated
for by her ardent piety. They
gave her our Blessed Lord after
giving her Extreme Unction. The
expression of her face was seraphic
in its joy and peace. All her little
companions were kneeling round
her bed, their eyes fixed in admiration
on the beaming countenance
of the dying child. One of them,
called Anna, who was her chosen
friend, an orphan from a remote
desert tribe like herself, drew near
to say good-by. The two children
clasped each other in silence; but
when they parted, the tears were
streaming down Amelia’s cheeks.
“Why did you make her cry, my
child?” whispered the nun to Anna
reproachfully. “I did not do it on
purpose,” was the reply. “I only
said, ‘O Amelia! you are too
happy; why can’t you take me with
you?’ and then we both cried.”
The happy little sufferer lingered
on in great pain for another day
and night, constantly kissing her
crucifix, thanking those around her
for their kindness and patience.</p>

<p>Towards the evening of the second
day the pains grew rapidly
worse, and she entreated to be carried
to the chapel, that she might
look once more upon the tabernacle.
The nun took her in her
arms, and laid her on the step of
the altar, when her sufferings instantly
ceased, and she sank into a
sleep which they thought was the
last one. She was carried back and
laid on her bed, but soon opened
her eyes with a look of ecstatic
joy, and cried out, gazing upwards,
“See! how beautifully it shines.
And the music&mdash;do you hear? Oh!
it is the <cite>Gloria in Excelsis</cite>.” No
one heard anything; only <em>her</em> ears
were opened to the heavenly harmonies
that were sounding through
the half-open doors of Paradise.
She continued listening with the
same rapt expression of delight,
and then, clasping her little hands
together, she cried, “Alleluia! alleluia!”
and fell back and spoke
no more. She had passed the
golden portals; the glories of heaven
were visible to her now.</p>

<p>What wonder if the apostolic
souls who reap such harvests as
these count their labors light, and
rejoice in the midst of their poverty
and self-imposed martyrdom!</p>

<p>But there are homelier and less
pathetic joys in the Orphanage
every now and then than these
blessed deaths. When the boys
and girls have learnt all they need
learn, and have come to the age
when they must leave the fathers
and the nuns, they are perfectly
free to return to their native tribes;
and it is a convincing argument in
favor of the strength of their newly-acquired
principles and affections
that they almost invariably
refuse to do so. The proportion
of those who go back to the old
life is one in every hundred. The
next thing to be considered is what
to do with those who refuse to go
back. The plan of marrying the
orphans amongst each other suggested
itself as the most practical
method of securing lasting results
from their Christian education. The
chief difficulty in the execution of
this plan was the reluctance of the
Arab girls to marry men of their
own race; they had learned the
privileges which women owe to
Christianity, and they had no mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_821" id="Page_821">[821]</a></span>
to forego their dignity and equality,
and sink back into the degraded
position of an Arab’s wife. “We
will not marry to be beaten,” they
argued. “Find us Frenchmen, and
we will marry them and be good
wives.” No doubt they would, but
the Frenchmen unfortunately could
not be induced to take this view
of the case; and it required all
the influence of their superiors
to make the girls understand that
Christianity, in raising woman from
the condition of a slave to that of
man’s equal, compels him to respect
and cherish her.</p>

<p>The way in which the courtship
and marriage proceed between the
sons and daughters of the great
marabout (as the archbishop is
called) is curious in its picturesque
simplicity.</p>

<p>A band of fifteen couples were
lately married from the Orphanage
of Ben-Aknoun. The fathers informed
the archbishop they had
fifteen excellent boys who were
about to leave, and whom they wished
to find wives for and settle in
the nearest Christian village. The
archbishop asked the superior of
the girls’ school if she could supply
fifteen maidens who would go and
share the humble homes of their
brother orphans.</p>

<p>The superior replied that she
had precisely the number required&mdash;girls
who must leave the shelter of
the convent in a few months, and
whom she was most anxious to see
provided for. The grapes were ripe,
and the vintage, which was close
at hand, would furnish an opportunity
for a meeting between the
parties. So one morning, in the
cool, sweet dawn, they set out to the
vineyard, the maidens conducted
by a sister, the youths by one of
the priests; the latter took one
side and culled the grapes, while
at the other side the maidens gathered
up the branches and bound
them into bundles. As they
went they sang hymns and canticles
to lighten their labor; and
when the day’s task was done, they
left the vineyard in two distinct
bands, as they had come, and returned
to their separate convents.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mgr. de la Vigerie
to the presiding father next day,
“have the young men chosen each
his maiden, and is the choice approved?”</p>

<p>“Alas! monseigneur, they did
not even look at each other,” replied
the disconsolate matchmaker.
“They never raised their eyes from
their work. Sister C&mdash;&mdash; and I
watched them like lynxes.”</p>

<p>“You have brought up the children
too well, my good father,”
cried the archbishop in despair.
“What is to be done with them
now?”</p>

<p>“Have a little patience, my lord,
and it will come in good time,” replied
the father encouragingly.</p>

<p>Next day the two bands of maidens
and youths sallied forth again
to the vineyard, and so every day
for a week.</p>

<p>Then the father came in triumph
to the archbishop to announce the
successful issue of the scheme.
One by one the youths had plucked
up courage and peeped through
the tendrils of the vine, and, thanks
to some magnetic sympathy, two
dark eyes had been simultaneously
raised to meet theirs, and they
smiled at each other. A little further
on the green leaves were fluttered
by a whisper asking the fair
one’s name; she told it, and another
whisper told her his. So the flower
blossomed in the thirty young
hearts, and the priest and the sister
who watched the gentle growth
looked on delighted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_822" id="Page_822">[822]</a></span></p>

<p>But what wily diplomatists they
are, these holy missionaries! How
they know the human heart, and
how cunningly they can play upon
it! Not a word did they say; but,
feigning complete blindness to the
pretty little comedy, marshalled
the laborers home as if nothing had
occurred to change the still current
of their young lives. A month
went by, and then, when the time
came for the youths to leave the
Orphanage, the father inquired, with
seeming innocence, if they thought
of marriage by and by.</p>

<p>The question was evaded at first
shyly; then by degrees the confession
came out&mdash;they had each determined
to marry one of the maidens
of the vineyard. The father threw
up his hands in amazement, shook
his head, and expressed grave
doubts as to the possibility of their
obtaining such a prize. These maidens
were pearls worthy to be set in
fine gold; they had been reared
like delicate plants in the shadow
of the sanctuary; their hearts were
pure as lilies, guileless as the flowers
of the field; they were strong in
faith and adorned with all the virtues.
Were poor Arab youths worthy
of such wives? But, brave
with the boldness of true love, the
suitors answered in one voice:
“We will be worthy; we will work
for them and serve them faithfully;
we will love them and be fathers
and mothers to them! Give us the
maidens of the vineyard!”</p>

<p>The missionary heaved a sigh,
looked mightily perplexed, but
promised to speak to the archbishop
and see what could be done. After
several solemn interviews, in which
the young men were severely catechised
and warned, and made to
pledge themselves to strive with all
their might to make the maidens
happy, to treat them reverently,
and serve them humbly, the archbishop
undertook to intercede for
them. The fair ones, being of the
race of Eve, were a trifle coy at
first; but soon the truth was elicited,
and each confessed that, since she
needs must marry some one, Ben-Aïssa,
or Hassan, or Scheriff, would
be less distasteful than another.
So the great affair was settled, and
soon came the day of the weddings.
The archbishop himself was to perform
the ceremony.</p>

<p>The fathers and sisters were
afoot before sunrise, you may be
sure; for what an event was this!
Fifteen Christian marriages celebrated
between the children of this
fallen race of idolaters! And now
see! the two processions are approaching
the church, the bridegrooms
draped in the native white
burnose, with the scarlet turban on
their heads; the brides clad in
spotless white, a soft white veil
crowned with white flowers covering
them from head to foot. Slowly,
with the simple majesty inherent
in their race, they advance to the
altar and kneel side by side before
the archbishop, who stands awaiting
them, robed in his gala vestments.
He looks down upon the
thirty young souls whom his love
has brought here to the foot of the
altar&mdash;the altar of the true God;
thirty souls whom he has had the
unspeakable joy and happiness of
rescuing from misery in this life
and&mdash;may he not hope?&mdash;in the next.
He must speak a few words to
them. He tries; but the father’s
heart is too full. The tears start to
his eyes and course down those
careworn cheeks; he goes from one
to the other, and silently presses
his hands on the head of each.
The marriage rite begins; the blessing
of the God of Abraham is called
down upon this new seed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_823" id="Page_823">[823]</a></span>
has sprung up in the parched land
of the patriarch, once so fertile in
saints; the music plays, and songs
of rejoicing resound on every side
as the fifteen brides issue from the
church with their bridegrooms.</p>

<p>And now do you care to follow
them to their new homes, and to
see where their after-life is cast?
The earthly providence which has
so tenderly fostered them thus far
follows them still into the wide
world where they have embarked.</p>

<p>The archbishop’s plan from the
start was to found Christian villages
in the desert, and to people
them with these new Christians
educated by the missionaries. The
cost of founding a village, including
the purchase of the land, the
building of twenty-five huts, furnishing
the inhabitants with European
implements of labor, building
a little church and a house for the
fathers and one for the sisters, an
enclosure for the cattle, a well to
supply that first element of life and
comfort&mdash;pure water in abundance&mdash;amounts
to forty thousand francs
(or say eight thousand dollars), and
this only with the utmost economy.
The Society for the Propagation of
the Faith&mdash;that glorious institution,
to which Christendom owes a debt
that can only be paid in heaven&mdash;comes
nobly to the assistance of
Mgr. de la Vigerie. He supplies
the rest himself out of the resources
of his apostolic heart, so inexhaustible
in its ingenious devices of charity;
he prays and begs, and sends
his missionaries all over the world
begging.</p>

<p>One of them has lately come
over to Paris on that most heroic
of Christian enterprises&mdash;a begging
tour&mdash;and has brought with him a
little black boy from Timbuctoo,
who had been bought and sold
seven times before falling into the
hands of these new masters for the
sum of three hundred francs. He is
not yet ten years old&mdash;a mild-faced
little fellow, who, when you ask him
in French if he likes the father, answers
by a grin too significant to
need further comment, as he turns
his ebony face up to Père B&mdash;&mdash;
and wriggles a little closer to him.
Père B&mdash;&mdash; told us the child belonged
to a man-eating tribe, and
turned up the corner of his lip to
show some particular formation of
the teeth peculiar to that amiable
race of <i lang="fr">gourmands</i>. He says that
the same charming docility which
marks the young Arabs is observable
in most of the savage tribes;
they are far more susceptive and
easily moulded and impressed than
the children of the civilized races.</p>

<p>The capture and purchase of
these unhappy little slaves all along
the coast and in the northern parts of
Africa is part of the mission which
brings the fathers the greatest consolation.
It is of course attended
with immense risk, sometimes danger
even to life; but the human
merchandise which they thus obtain
“is worth it all and ten times
more,” the Père B&mdash;&mdash; declared
emphatically, as he dilated on the
fervor of these poor children’s faith
and the intensity of their gratitude.
The great and constant want for
the carrying on of the mission is&mdash;need
we mention it in this XIXth
century, when we can scarcely save
our own souls, much less our neighbors’,
without it?&mdash;money. People
say money is the root of all evil;
but really, when one sees what precious
immortal goods it can buy,
one is tempted to declare it the
root of all good. The archbishop
has recently sent one of his missionaries,
the Père C&mdash;&mdash;, to beg in
America, and we are heartily glad
to hear it. A French priest, speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_824" id="Page_824">[824]</a></span>
about begging for good works
the other day, said to the writer:
“I wish I could go to America and
make the round of the States with
my hat in my hand. They are a
delightful people to beg of. Somehow
they are so sympathetic to
the Catholic principle embodied in
begging for our Lord that they
take all the sting out of it for one;
but, oh! what a bitter cud it is to
chew in Europe.” We hope the
good father’s experience did not
represent the general one on the
latter point, but is well founded as
to the generous spontaneity of our
American fellow-Catholics towards
those who have “held out the hat”
to them in the name of our blessed
Lord. Sweet bond of charity!
how it welds the nations together,
casting its silver nets and drawing
all hearts into its meshes! It
matters not whether the fisher come
from a near country united to us
by ties of blood or clanship, or
from some distant clime where the
very face of man is scarce that of
a brother whom we recognize; he
comes in the name of our common
Lord, and asks us to help in the
saving of souls that cost as dear to
ransom as ours. He may labor
sometimes all the night, and take
nothing; but the dawn comes, when
he meets Jesus in the persons of
those generous souls who love him
and have his interests at heart, and
are always ready to befriend him;
and then the net is cast into deep
waters, and the draught is plentiful.
Can we fancy a sweeter reward to
stimulate our zeal in helping the
divine Mendicant who holds out
his hand to us for an alms than
the scene which at this moment
many multitudes of these faithful
souls may contemplate in imagination
as they have helped to create it.</p>

<p>A gathering of small, low houses&mdash;huts,
if you like&mdash;set in smiling
patches of garden round a central
building whose spire, pointing like
a silent finger to the skies, tells us
at once its character and destination.
The time is towards sundown;
the bell breaks the stillness of the
desert air, and with its silvery tongue
calls the villagers to prayer. The
entire population, old and young,
leave their work and rise obedient
to the summons; the children quit
their play and troop on together,
while the elders follow with grave
steps. The priest is kneeling before
the altar, where the lamp of the
sanctuary, like a throb of the Sacred
Heart within the tabernacle, sheds
its solemn radiance in the twilight.
The father begins the evening prayer;
pardon is asked for the sins and
forgettings of the day, thanks are
offered up for its helps and mercies,
blessings are invoked on the family
assembled, then on the benefactors
far away. One who assisted at this
idyl in the desert declares that
when he heard the officiating priest
call down the blessing of the Most
High on “all those dear benefactors
whom we do not know, but who
have been kind and charitable to
us”; and when the voices of the
Arabs answered in unison, repeating
the prayer, he felt his heart bursting
with joy at the thought that
he was included amongst those on
whom this blessing was nightly invoked.</p>

<p>The Litany of Our Lady is then
sung, and the assistants quietly disperse
and go home. The cattle are
lowing in the park. The stars, one
by one, are coming out in the lovely
sapphire sky. Angels are flying to
many of the white huts with gifts
and messages. Some are speeding
afar, eastward and westward, bearing
graces just granted in answer to
those grateful prayers; for who can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_825" id="Page_825">[825]</a></span>
tell the power of gratitude with God,
or his loving inability to resist its
wishes&mdash;he who was so lavish in his
thanks for the smallest act of kindness,
nay, of courtesy, when he lived
amongst us, and who declared that
even a cup of cold water should
not go without its reward?</p>

<h3>ORIGIN AND PROGRESS OF THE MISSION OF KENTUCKY.</h3>

<p class="center smaller">FROM THE FRENCH.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>The Diocese of Bardstown, Kentucky,
is a part of that vast extent
of country known in our ancient
geographies by the name of Louisiana.
It is situated in the centre
of the United States of North
America, and is bounded on the
north by the Ohio, on the west by
the Mississippi, on the south by the
State of Tennessee, and on the east
by Virginia.</p>

<p>When, in 1792, it was admitted
into the Union as a State, its population
was about seventy thousand;
but it has since then increased tenfold.</p>

<p>About twenty poor Catholic families
from Maryland, descendants of
the English colonists, came here to
reside in 1785, as then good land
could be procured here almost for
nothing.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>Their number rapidly increased,
and in the year 1788 Father Wheelan,
an Irish Franciscan, was sent to
them. As they were then at war
with the natives, and as this was
continued until 1795, this missionary,
two of his successors, and the
colonists were compelled to cross
the hostile country to arrive at the
mission, even on reaching which
their lives were sometimes exposed
to imminent dangers. Besides
being at a distance from a priest,
they had also to struggle against
poverty, heresy, and vulgar prejudices
with regard to the pretended
idolatry of Catholics, etc. Finally,
Father Wheelan, at the expiration
of two years and a half, abandoned
a post so difficult to hold, without
even the satisfaction of seeing a
single chapel built. It was then
impossible to find another missionary
to succeed him, and the faithful
“were afflicted because they had
no shepherd” (Zach. x. 2). Finally,
Holy Orders were conferred
in 1793 for the first time in this
part of the world, where the Catholics
had but so recently suffered
under the penal laws of England.
The illustrious Bishop Carroll, first
bishop of Baltimore, there ordained
a priest, M. Badin, from Orleans,
whom he then sent to Kentucky.
Besides the difficulties
which his predecessor met, the inexperience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_826" id="Page_826">[826]</a></span>
of the young ecclesiastic,
his slight knowledge of the
English language and of the habits
of the country, made his task still
more difficult. One can easily
conceive how painful must have
been the situation of a novice thus
isolated and deprived of guidance
in a ministry the weight of which
would have been burdensome for
the angels even, say the holy fathers
of the church.</p>

<p>It is true he started from Baltimore
with another French priest
who was invested with the power
of vicar-general. But this priest
was soon discouraged by the wandering
habits of the people and their
style of life. Four months had
scarcely elapsed when he returned
to New Orleans. M. Badin was
thus in sole charge of the mission
during several years, which mission,
since the conclusion of peace with
the savage tribes, continually increased
by the influx of the Catholics
who came here in large
numbers from Maryland and other
localities.</p>

<p>In addition to the fatigue of
travelling, to controversy with Protestants,
to his pastoral solicitude,
and to the frequent scruples of
conscience natural to one in a situation
so critical, he had to exert
himself still more to form new parishes,
prepare ecclesiastical establishments
at suitable distances, and
finally to erect churches or chapels
in the different places where the
Catholic population established itself.
Nevertheless, by the divine
mercy he obtained from time to time
profitable advice through the letters
which the charity of the neighboring
priest, who, though at a distance
of seventy miles, found means
to write him. M. Rivet, formerly
professor of rhetoric in the College
of Limoges, in the year 1795 came
to reside as <i lang="fr">curé</i> and vicar-general
at Post Vincennes, on the Wabash,
in Indiana.</p>

<p>But the respective needs of the
two missions never permitted them
to cross the desert in order to
visit one another or to offer mutual
encouragement and consolation
in the Lord. Oh! how much
anguish, how many prayers and
tears, arise from such isolation!
And did not our divine Saviour
send his disciples in couples to
preach the Gospel?&mdash;<i lang="la">misit illos binos</i>
(S. Luc. x.)</p>

<p>Finally, two priests from the Diocese
of Blois&mdash;MM. Fournier and
Salmon&mdash;came successively, in the
years 1797 and 1799, to the rescue
of the pastor and his flock.</p>

<p>Divine Providence rendered useful
to Kentucky and to several
other portions of the Diocese of
Baltimore the talents and virtues
of a great number of ecclesiastics
whom the French Revolution threw
on the shores of America. In the
same year, 1799, there arrived a
fourth missionary&mdash;M. Thayer, the
Presbyterian minister of Boston,
who was converted through the
miracles of blessed Labre. At first
he ridiculed this humble servant of
God and the miracles which were
attributed to him, but afterwards
he investigated them with all the
prejudices of a sectarian. He
brought to bear upon them his
severest criticism, and finished by
becoming a Catholic at Rome, a
priest at Paris, and a missionary in
his own country, where he had formerly
propagated error. He found
himself forced to write several English
works of controversy, which
are lucid and deservedly appreciated.
His conversion, his writings,
and his sermons excited either the
interest or the curiosity of all classes
of society, and he hoped to serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_827" id="Page_827">[827]</a></span>
the cause of religion in multiplying
himself, if one may speak thus.
He travelled over the United
States, Canada, and a great part of
Europe, and died, beloved and revered,
at Limerick, in Ireland.</p>

<p>The missionaries of Kentucky are
obliged to ride on horseback nearly
every day of the year, and to brave
often alone the solitude of the forests,
the darkness of night, and the
inclemency of the seasons, to minister
to the sick and to visit their
congregations on the appointed
days.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>Without this exactitude it would
be difficult to assemble the families
scattered so far apart. M. Salmon
was without doubt an excellent ecclesiastic,
though but a poor horseman.
His zeal induced him, on the
9th of November, 1799, to visit a
distant parish where he was instructing
a Protestant who has since
then embraced the faith.</p>

<p>Being already feeble and just
convalescing from a severe illness,
a fall from his horse carried him to
the grave in less than thirty-six
hours. The accident happened
towards noon at a little distance
from a residence. A servant who
found him half-dead in the woods
went to solicit aid, which was denied
him by an impious and cruel farmer,
simply because the unfortunate
man was a priest. It was only towards
night that a good Catholic
of the neighborhood&mdash;Mr. Gwynn&mdash;was
informed of the fact. It must
nevertheless be admitted that this
farmer’s revolting conduct is in
nowise American, and can but be attributed
to his individual hate for the
true religion. Perhaps, also, he was
ignorant of the extremity to which
M. Salmon was reduced. This fatal
event, the departure of M. Thayer
for Ireland, and the equally sudden
death of M. Fournier in February,
1803, left M. Badin for about
seventeen months in sole charge of
the mission, then consisting of about
a thousand families scattered over
a space of from seven to eight hundred
square miles. The death of
M. Rivet, which took place in February,
1803, deprived him of the
comforting letters of this friend,
who expired almost in the arms of
the governor of the province, whose
esteem and affection he enjoyed.
At this unfortunate period the nearest
priest was a M. Olivier from
Nantes, an elderly gentleman, who
resided at a distance of one hundred
and thirty miles in an Illinois village
called Prairie du Rocher. Moreover,
he ministered to Kaskaskia,
where the Jesuits had formerly instituted
a novitiate; Cahokia, St.
Louis, capital of Missouri, St. Genevieve,
etc., on the banks of the
Mississippi. M. Richard, a zealous
and pious Sulpitian, resided at
the same distance at Detroit, on
Lake St. Clair, in Michigan.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>Finally, there were then but three
priests in an extent of country
larger than would be France and
Spain if united, and which country
constitutes to-day but one diocese,
called Bardstown, formed in 1808
by the reigning Pope, as will be
seen in the sequel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_828" id="Page_828">[828]</a></span></p>

<p>It is true that the most distant
parishes can be visited but seldom,
and it is especially in these instances
that the zeal of faith and the
fervor of piety are most evident.</p>

<p>One finds a great many persons
who undertake fatiguing trips in
order to fulfil their Christian duties.
They are seen at times to
spend the night in church, in order
to make sure of having access to
the sacred tribunal, where the missionaries
are to be found from early
dawn.</p>

<p>They are obliged to say, and
sometimes even to chant, Mass at
noon, and occasionally several hours
afterwards, in order that all those
who are prepared for the tribunal
of Penance may also receive Holy
Communion. Neither the fast, nor
the late hour, nor the fatigues of
the morning exempt them from instructing
the people; otherwise it
would never be done, as the faithful
are assembled but once a day.
A sermon, or at least an impromptu
exhortation, on controversy, morals,
or the discipline of the church, is
always in order. After divine service
there are the dead to be buried,
the children to be baptized,
marriages to be performed, etc., and
then the departure for another station,
which being reached the next
day, the same services are to be repeated.
Often it so happens that
there is not one day of rest during
the entire week, especially when
several sick persons who live far
apart are to be visited.</p>

<p>While the confessor is occupied
with his priestly functions the
catechists instruct the children and
the negroes, sing canticles, and recite
the rosary, etc. To in a manner
fill the vacancy caused by their
absence, the priests recommended
public prayer in families, catechism,
and nightly examination of conscience;
Mass prayers, devotions
of S. Bridget, the litanies, spiritual
reading on Sundays and feast-days.
Pious persons add to this the rosary,
and their devotion to the Blessed
Virgin causes them every day to
recite some special prayer in her
honor.</p>

<p>The fear of God, respect for the
priesthood, or filial piety often causes
good Christians to bend the knee
before their fathers and mothers,
their sponsors, and their priests, to
ask their blessing after prayer, in
the streets of the city or on the
highways. English books on controversy
are being rapidly multiplied,
and the majority of the country-people
know how to read them,
and there are some persons in every
congregation who really study them
in order to render themselves capable
of sustaining a discussion with
Protestants.</p>

<p>By this means, as also by their
piety and honesty, they assist from
time to time in gaining conversions
to the faith. The number of these
good works greatly increased when
Providence sent to us, in 1804, a
new missionary, M. Nérinckx, a
Flemish priest, who pursued his
apostolic labors unceasingly. He
instituted three monasteries, which
were of great benefit in educating
poor girls, either Catholics or non-Catholics.
These religious women,
who are called Friends of Mary at
the Foot of the Cross, remind us
of the days of the primitive church.
Their manner of life is exceedingly
laborious; they observe perpetual
silence, and are almost enveloped
in their veil.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>A short time after M. Nérinckx<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_829" id="Page_829">[829]</a></span>
arrived at the mission he was followed
there by a colony of Trappists,
and by two pious and learned
English priests of the Order of S.
Dominic. The one, Father Wilson,
afterwards became provincial;
and Rev. Father Tuite is at present
master of novices. The Trappists
organized a school for gratuitous
education, but failed to find
among the poor Catholics of the
neighborhood sufficient means to
maintain this charitable institution.
Father Urbain Guillet, their
superior, had conceived the idea of
rendering himself useful to the
savages by educating their children
for them, hoping in this way to facilitate
their conversion.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this idea he
formed a new establishment near
Cahokia. These good religious
greatly edified the country by their
austerity, their silence, and their
good works; but as missions were
not the objects of their order, they
returned to France at the Restoration.
We must now speak of the
natives, and by so doing gratify the
very natural curiosity of our readers.
The majority of the savages
believe in the existence, in the
spirituality, and in the unity of God,
whom they style the Great Spirit,
the Master of Life, or Kissernanetou.
They even appear to believe somewhat
in his providence; they offer
him prayers, and sometimes even
sacrifices according to their fashion.
Here is an example, which is authentic,
as it was told the author of
this work by Gen. Todd, one of
the leading men of Kentucky. A
native, annoyed by the extreme
drought, offered his pipe, or wampum,
his most valuable article, to
the Great Spirit; then, seated pensively
on the banks of a river, he
supplicated him thus: “Kissernanetou!
thou knowest how highly the
Indian prizes his wampum; well,
then, give us rain, and I will give
thee my wampum.” And as the
Indian said this, he threw his pipe in
the river, fully persuaded that the
Great Spirit would hear his prayer.
They also believe in a future state,
as with their dead they bury their
guns or cross-bows to enable them
to hunt in the next world; also
their pipe and tobacco, meat, etc.
Those who were instructed by the
Jesuits, although deprived of missionaries
for about fifty years, still
retain some idea of the true religion,
as will be seen from letters of M. Olivier,
from which letters we will
give a few examples; the first, being
dated the 16th of May, 1806, is
addressed to Father Urbain Guillet;
the second, dated the 6th of
August, 1806; and the third, the 15th
of March, 1807, were written to M.
Badin:</p>

<p>1. “Among the savage tribes who
from the time of the Jesuits (whom
they called Black Gowns) had embraced
Christianity and had erected
churches in which the greatest regularity
existed, to-day, notwithstanding
I am their pastor, I do nothing
but baptize their children, although
among those of Post Vincennes
there are some who come to
confession; which leads me to think
that you might procure some of
their children.</p>

<p>2. “Since the banishment of the
Jesuit fathers religion has decreased
by degrees, until now there remain
but a few traces which would remind
one of extinct piety. I am
not forgetting the desire expressed
by Father Guillet, superior of the
Trappists&mdash;namely, to have in his
community some of the children of
these savages. The chief of the
nation, who is at Kaskaskia, promised
to ask his brethren to send
some here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_830" id="Page_830">[830]</a></span></p>

<p>3. “The chief of those at Kaskaskia,
in selling his lands to the
government of the United States,
required that it should build him a
church; and there is a provision of
300 piastres and 100 piastres to be
paid yearly to the missionary priest
for seven years. Can these missions
be revived? The mercy of
God is great, etc.…”</p>

<p>Yes, the mercy of God is great,
and it may be hoped that Mgr.
Dubourg and his missionaries, who
for some years have been living in
the vicinity of the Missouri and the
Mississippi, will have all desired
success, which they must undoubtedly
obtain if they succeed, as did the
Jesuits, in procuring the assistance
of the French government.</p>

<p>The religious of S. Dominic
succeeded tolerably well in their
establishments in Kentucky and
Ohio.</p>

<p>Father Edward Fenwick, born in
Maryland, had become a member
of this order, and professor at the
College of Bornheim, in Flanders,
where he had been educated. Upon
his return to his native country
he spent his inheritance in founding
the Convent of S. Rose and a
school which is situated in Washington
County. Two zealous missionaries,
Father Fenwick and his
nephew, Father Young, were the
first to devote themselves, two years
ago, to preach the faith in the State
of Ohio, north of Kentucky, and
three churches have already been
built there.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>The congregations in the interior
are composed of Germans, Irish,
and Americans; but on the lakes
that separate the United States from
Canada they are formed of French
colonies. In the State and on the
right bank of the Ohio is situated
Gallipolis, principal seat of the
county of Gallia, where in 1791
some French colonists tried to establish
themselves; but they were
victims of a miserable speculation,
and the majority of them left the
country.</p>

<p>MM. Barrières and Badin baptized
in this place about forty children
in the year 1793, and then
went to Kentucky. The entire
village revived at the sight of these
two priests, their fellow-countrymen,
at the singing of the sacred
canticles, and the celebration of the
Holy Mysteries. In this part of
America entire liberty of conscience
and religion are enjoyed.
One does not fear being molested
if Christian burial be refused to
those who have lived a scandalous
life. On the contrary, it is expected
that such will be the case, as it is
the rule of the church; hence the
increased dread of dying without
the Last Sacraments. Marriages
according to the Catholic
rite are legal, and divorce and
polygamy are unknown among Catholics.</p>

<p>We march in procession around
our cemeteries; we erect crosses on
them; we preach in the hotels and
other public places, and even in
Protestant churches, for want of
chapels, and all the sects come in
crowds. During the Mass they behave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_831" id="Page_831">[831]</a></span>
in a respectful and attentive
manner&mdash;some of them even bring
us their children to baptize, and entrust
the education of their daughters
to our religious&mdash;and sometimes
we are greatly astonished to
see non-Catholics undertake to defend
our belief. We also meet
with great respect in social life; for
the Americans are very fond of the
French, whose politeness and gayety
they try to emulate.</p>

<p>They remember with pleasure and
gratitude the services they received
from the Martyr-King. Finally,
the government of Kentucky
has incorporated or commemorated
French names in its institutions;
hence we have Bourbon
County, of which Paris is the
principal town. We also find
a Versailles, a Louisville, etc.
In this last place we built, with
the aid of the Protestants, the beautiful
church of S. Louis, King of
France.</p>

<p>Having the greatest esteem for
learned men, they received the
French priests with generous hospitality,
and our bishops are revered
by all sects. M. Carroll,
formerly professor of theology
among the Jesuits, bishop and
finally archbishop of Baltimore, was
one of the most distinguished men
in America, and he was universally
beloved and respected. He was
consecrated in England the 15th
of August, 1790. Two years afterwards
he convoked a synod in Baltimore,
where he was successful
in assembling twenty-five priests.
His modesty and his piety were as
much admired as his learning. Finally,
by his urbanity and his inexhaustible
charity, he won all
hearts, even those of the Protestant
clergy.</p>

<p>His edifying death, mild and patient
in the greatest sufferings, took
place the 3d of December, 1815&mdash;the
day on which the church celebrates
the Feast of S. Francis Xavier,
the glory of the Jesuits.</p>

<p>His death caused universal grief
in a country where his memory
has never ceased to be venerated.
It is incredible how he could have
been equal to all the tasks he had to
accomplish, besides all the mental
labor that fell to his share. He afterwards
obtained from the Holy
See a coadjutor, M. Neale, like
himself an American and an ex-Jesuit.
His Diocese embraced all
the United States; and he was,
moreover, administrator of the diocese
of New Orleans. Our Holy
Father, the Pope, has since then
been entreated to create four new
bishoprics&mdash;namely, Philadelphia,
New York, Boston and Bardstown.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>M. Flaget, a Sulpitian, arrived
in America with MM. David and
Badin in the year 1792, and was appointed
to this last-named bishopric.
His humility was alarmed. He
thought he neither possessed the
talent nor the other qualifications
necessary to fill so high a position;
and for two years he persisted in
his refusal, but he was finally obliged
to submit to the express mandate
of the Pope, and undertook the
task, for which he was evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_832" id="Page_832">[832]</a></span>
destined by divine Providence.
He is doubtless the poorest prelate
of the Christian world, but he is
none the less zealous and disinterested.</p>

<p>“Blessed is the rich man that is
found without blemish; and that
hath not gone after gold, nor put
his trust in money, nor in treasures.
Who is he, and we will praise him?
for he hath done wonderful things
in his life” (Ecclesiasticus xxxi.
8, 9).<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>In a limited number of years he
founded so many institutions, undertook
so many voyages, underwent
so much fatigue, both of mind
and body, and succeeded so well in
all his projects for extending the
kingdom of Jesus Christ, that we
must attribute his success and the
diffusion of religion to the special
blessing of God which accompanied
him unceasingly. M. David, superior
of the seminary, consecrated
bishop-coadjutor the 15th of August,
1819, co-operated with him in
his good works: in the founding of
the seminary, which has already
produced eight or ten priests; in
the founding of several convents for
the Sisters of S. Vincent de Paul; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_833" id="Page_833">[833]</a></span>
the building of the cathedral of
Bardstown, etc.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>It is in this little village, situated
in the centre of the country, that
the episcopal seat has been fixed.
The smallest seed becomes a large
tree, said our Saviour in the Gospel.
This diocese embraces six
large States&mdash;Tennessee, Kentucky,
Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, and Illinois.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>In all this country, where the
population, the sciences and the
arts, agriculture and commerce,
have in the last twenty years progressed
wonderfully, fifty years ago
could be seen dense forests and
limitless prairies, inhabited only by
wild beasts or scattered Indian
tribes. But there are to-day in this
diocese twenty-five priests, seven
convents, two seminaries or colleges,
thirty-five churches or chapels,<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
and about forty thousand Catholics
out of a population of two million
inhabitants of all denominations.</p>

<p>In all these States priests and
churches are found except in Tennessee,
which, owing to its great
distance and other drawbacks, has
been visited but four times by the
oldest missionary in Kentucky.
He gathered together a little flock
at Knoxville, the capital. With
regard to this place may these
words of the prophet be fulfilled:
“I will whistle for them and gather
them together; I have redeemed
them; and I will multiply them as
they were multiplied before. And
I will sow them among peoples,
and from afar they shall remember
me.” The bishop has been
trying to establish a free school for
the poor Catholics who have not
made their First Communion. Half
of their time is employed in cultivating
the ground to defray their
expenses, and the other half is devoted
to reading, writing, and instructions
in Christian doctrine.
With fifty such schools we could
renovate the entire diocese, and
gather into the fold a great many
souls which otherwise would be deprived
of the means of salvation.
Thus it is evident that what has
been done is nothing in comparison
with what remains to be done.
Our institutions, besides the incidental
and the daily expenses of
the sanctuary, the voyage, etc., cost
more than 300,000 francs; and
the bishop, who receives but 600
francs of ecclesiastical revenue,
owes more than 25,000 for his
cathedral, which is not yet finished,
much less decorated. Unforeseen
events precluded the possibility
of the subscribers making
their payments; and if to-day they
were forced to do so according to
the rigor of the law, it would be
of material injury to religion, and
would produce the most baneful
effect on the minds and the hearts
of both Catholics and Protestants,
who are also subscribers. The
church in Kentucky owns some land,
to be sure; but to clear this land,
and then to cultivate it, laborers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_834" id="Page_834">[834]</a></span>
are lacking, and consequently this
uncultivated property produces no
revenue. The majority of the students,
both at the seminary and the
monastery, pay no board. The missionaries
receive no assistance from
the state; they are entirely dependent
on their parishioners, who often
do not even defray their travelling
expenses, and perquisites are unheard
of.</p>

<p>The spirit of religion obliges us
to make a great many sacrifices and
to endure innumerable privations
to avoid being considered avaricious,
and frequently it is necessary
to make presents. Sometimes they
ask us for prayer-books or books
of controversy, sometimes for catechisms,
rosaries, etc., etc. Moreover,
when the necessary expenses
for the support of two or three hundred
persons<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> are calculated and
contrasted with our limited resources,
that they suffice seems incredible;
and the mystery thereof
can only be solved by referring it
to that infinite Providence which
feeds the birds of the air and gives
to the lilies of the valley a glory
more dazzling than that of Solomon.</p>

<p>This paternal Providence, after
having accomplished such wonders,
will not abandon us in our present
distress. After making use of his
ministers as means of operation, he
will also inspire religious souls with
the desire to co-operate in these
good works, and crown his gifts in
crowning the merits of their charity.</p>

<p>The writer of this notice was a
witness to the greater number of
events he relates&mdash;“Quod vidimus
et audivimus, hoc annuntiamus vobis”
(1 Joan. i.) After working
twenty-five years in this mission, he
returned to France to take a little
rest and to solicit aid from his
countrymen, according to the instructions
of his bishop. Although
weakened by a serious illness which
he had undergone the preceding
fall, and which nearly exhausted his
means, he proposed, together with
M. Chabrat, a missionary from the
same country, to recross the ocean
and undertake a journey of nearly
four hundred miles to reach Kentucky,
where his services are still
required.</p>

<p>If some ecclesiastics felt themselves
called to accompany him to
America, they will doubtless be persuaded
from the perusal of this
truthful narrative that they will also
have to travel the way of the cross,
which we know to be the way to
heaven. It will also be expedient
that they procure all the books according
to the ritual of Rome; theological
and Biblical works in French,
English, and Latin; chalices, ciboriums,
crucifixes, vestments and
church ornaments, altar pictures&mdash;in
fact, everything relating to divine
service. Surely they will be assisted
through the piety of their
friends and acquaintances. How
many persons in France possess
ecclesiastical or theological works
which are not printed in America,
as also sacred ornaments which are
of no use to them; whereas these
articles could be employed in so
useful and so holy a manner in
these new missions, which are in
need of everything and possess nothing!
We hope through the charity
of pious and wealthy souls that
they will generously offer to the
service of God this small portion
of the gifts they have received from
him in abundance. Faith teaches
us that he will not allow himself to
be outdone in generosity, and what
they sacrifice to his glory will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_835" id="Page_835">[835]</a></span>
returned a hundred-fold. As for
us, our gratitude will cause us to
recommend our benefactors to the
prayers of the missionaries, of the
religious orders, and of the laity
who are thus benefited; and we promise
to celebrate a solemn Mass of
thanksgiving, to which we will invite
all good Christians, to whom
we will suggest a general Communion
to be offered to God for the
same intention.</p>

causing the “Barrens” to prosper.
Thus, my dear friend, will the diocese
be managed during your absence,
while you, I hope, will make
collections for our poor parishes,
which are in great want. I am going
to re-employ your brother, who is as
pious and studious as ever, at the
senior seminary in Bardstown. I
earnestly desire to see him a priest,

Bishop Dubourg is endeavoring
to have a bishop assigned to

succeeds, I will have less extent of

opportunities as I now have of
making priests.</p>

<p>Thus the prospects of my diocese
are daily becoming more promising.
Hasten to return; for God
has not bestowed upon you so perfect
a knowledge of the language

<h3>BLESSED NICHOLAS VON DER FLÜE.</h3>

<p>Of the many beautiful views from
the Rigi, none seemed so determined
to imprint itself on our memories
during our stay at Kaltbad as
that looking up the Valley of Sarnen.
At whatever hour we wandered
to the Känzli, early or late,
in bright weather or in dull, it was
all the same. Somehow the sun
was always lighting up the valley;
either resting placidly on its velvety
pastures, shining broadly over
its small lake, and making it glitter
like a brilliant dewdrop amidst the
encircling verdure, or, at the very
least, darting shy gleams across its
waters from behind the clouds
which lowered on all else around.
The lake of Zug was much nearer
to us, lying right beneath one angle
of the Rigi; but it had not the like
powers of fascination. Moreover,
we noticed that exactly in the same
degree that Sarnen attracted the
sun Zug seemed to repel it. At
all events, the lasting remembrance
of Zug is dark, bleak, and unfriendly;
that of Sarnen, on the contrary,
peaceful and sunny. It seemed,
too, as though it were tenderly
watched over by all its neighbors.
Mt. Pilatus guards the entrance to it
from Lucerne, hills enclose the valley
on three sides, while above and
beyond, as seen from Kaltbad, rise
those giants of the Oberland which
give such sublimity to these scenes,
and enhance their beauty by the
constant variety of their aspect.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the associations
connected with Sarnen had something
to do with our love for it. In
the village of Sachslen, on the
borders of its lake, Blessed Nicholas
von der Flüe was born and lived,
and there his remains are now preserved.</p>

<p>And here, behind this promontory
of the Bürgenstock, just opposite
the Känzli, lies Stanz, the capital
of Nidwalden&mdash;as this division of
Unterwalden is now called&mdash;whither
Blessed Nicholas hurried, and,
by his influence with the Assembly,
succeeded in saving his country
from civil war.</p>

<p>A visit to Sachslen held a special
place in the programme sketched
out for us by Herr H&mdash;&mdash;.
There were some days, too, still to
spare before the feast at Einsiedeln
on the 14th; so we determined
to lose no further time in making
our pilgrimage to “Bruder Klaus,”
as my Weggis guide and all the
people hereabouts affectionately call
him.</p>

<p>It was easy to trace the route
when standing at the Känzli, and to
perceive that, by crossing over to
Buochs, we might drive thence to
Sachslen. Dismissing, therefore,
all fears of the railway descent from
our minds, we started by the eleven
o’clock train from Kaltbad, which
it cost us many a pang to leave,
with its dear little church, its lovely
views, and its bright, invigorating
air. Crossing then in the steamer
from Vitznau to Buochs, we speedily
engaged carriages to take us to
Sachslen, and to bring us back from
thence on the following day.</p>

<p>Our road led through Stanz, the
home of Arnold von Winkelried,
where we lingered long, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_837" id="Page_837">[837]</a></span>
determined not to visit the Rathhaus
until our return from the sanctuary
of its hero. But we had two statues
of Arnold to admire&mdash;one, in fact,
a handsome white marble group
commemorating his noble feat at
Sempach, and erected by national
subscription&mdash;to catch a view of
Winkelried’s house in a distant
meadow; to see in the church statues
of “Bruder Klaus” and Konrad
Scheuber&mdash;who also led a solitary
life of holiness in the Engelberg
valley close by, and whose
highest honor it was to call himself
the “Daughter’s Son” of the great
hermit&mdash;to read the tablet in the
mortuary chapel in memory of the
four hundred and fourteen priests,
women, and children who had fallen
victims to the French soldiery
in 1798; and to hear tales of the
desolation their unbridled vengeance
caused all this country.
Pretty Stanz! now looking so happy,
smiling, and prosperous that it
is difficult to realize it ever could
have been laid in ashes some
seventy years ago. No district in
Switzerland is more fruitful at present;
cultivated like a garden, dotted
over with fine timber, and making
a beautiful picture backed by
the Engelberg line of mountains
stretching away behind.</p>

<p>An avenue of stately walnut-trees
leads to the little port of Stanzstadt,
and on the way we passed the
chapel of Winkelried, where an
annual fête is held, and close to
which the bodies of eighteen women
were found, after the fight in
1798, lying beside those of their
fathers, husbands, and brothers&mdash;so
completely had it then become a
war <i lang="fr">à outrance</i>, in defence of hearths
and homes.</p>

<p>From Stanzstadt the road turned
abruptly westward, at first along
the edge of the small lake of Alpnach,
the ruins of Rossberg Castle
perceptible on the opposite
shore&mdash;the first Austrian stronghold
taken by the Rütli confederates on
the memorable New Year’s morning
of 1308.</p>

<p>Thence the hills grew lower and
the landscape more pastoral than
Alpine, until we reached Sarnen,
above which formerly rose the castle
of Landenberg, the famous imperial
vogt who put out the eyes
of old Anderbalben, of the Melchthal,
in punishment for his son’s
misdemeanors when the latter evaded
his pursuit. This barbarous
act was the immediate cause of the
Rütli uprising; but, like all the
others, the castle was taken by surprise,
and Landenberg’s life was
spared. The terrace where it stood
is still called the Landenberg, and
there the cantonal assembly has
annually met since 1646. Of this
spot it is that Wordsworth speaks
in his desultory stanzas:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent12">“Ne’er shall ye disgrace</div>
<div class="verse">Your noble birthright, ye that occupy</div>
<div class="verse">Your council-seats beneath the open sky</div>
<div class="verse">On Sarnen’s mount; there judge of fit and right,</div>
<div class="verse">In simple democratic majesty;</div>
<div class="verse">Soft breezes fanning your rough brows, the might</div>
<div class="verse">And purity of nature spread before your sight.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The panorama thence is said to
be magnificent, and it was easy to
conceive it all-inspiring to a patriotic
orator; but the evening had
closed in before we crossed the
Sarnen bridge, and it was hopeless
to attempt the ascent thither.</p>

<p>Whilst Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; was inquiring
about rooms we hastened to a
church near where a bell had been
tolling as we entered the town.
“Only a chapel,” answered an old
woman; “for the Blessed Sacrament
is not kept there.” But the “chapel”
contained the cheering sight
of troops of children saying their
night prayers aloud, headed by
some of their elders. The inn is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_838" id="Page_838">[838]</a></span>
modest, clean establishment, but in
any case it would have been dear
to us, all the rooms being full of
pictures of “Bruder Klaus” and
of every incident in his life. Herr
H&mdash;&mdash; had said that “no house in
Obwalden is without his picture,”
and this quick fulfilment of our expectations
enchanted us. Instantly
we stormed the <i lang="de">Kellnerinns</i> with
questions; but, alas! they were Bernese
maidens, and, whether from
prejudice or stolid ignorance, they
only gave us the old stereotyped
answer that “they were ‘Reformed,’
from the other side of the Bruning
pass, and knew nothing, nor ever
inquired about such matters.”</p>

<p>Accustomed as we had been of
late to the large tourist hotels, everything
seemed preternaturally quiet,
when suddenly, late that evening,
a deep voice sounded in the distance,
advancing steadily onwards.
We had scarcely time to reflect on
this singular intrusion on the peaceful
village when it became evident
that it was that mediæval institution,
“the watchman going his
rounds,” which none of us ever before
had an opportunity of becoming
acquainted with; and as he
came along the streets he distinctly
sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The clock has struck ten;</div>
<div class="verse">Put out fire and light,</div>
<div class="verse">Pray God and his Mother</div>
<div class="verse">To save and protect us!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And constantly during the night
the same appealing voice returned,
merely changing the hour as time
ran on.</p>

<p>Next morning the sun again befriended
us, and Mass was “at the
convent hard by,” said our hostess&mdash;“the
convent of Benedictines,
who teach all our girls.” And she
said truly; for not only did we
find their chapel crowded by the
villagers, men, women, and children,
while the nuns’ choir was hidden
behind the altar, but High
Mass was being sung at that early
hour of half-past seven, with exposition
of the Blessed Sacrament,
ending by Benediction. Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;
and George visited the Rathhaus
and its portraits; but we were in
feverish haste to get on to Sachslen,
“two miles off,” said a peasant woman
we accosted on the road, and
who also said she was on her way
thither to pray at the shrine of
“Bruder Klaus.” Immediately after
breakfast, therefore, taking leave
of our comely hostess and of this
capital of Obwalden, still so primitively
good, although in the close
vicinity of the “great world,” and
feeling an increased aversion to the
Bernese maidens, whose spirit is
unmoved by things supernatural,
we drove along the flat borders
of the Sarnen lake, caught sight of
the Rigi and its Känzli, and in
less than half an hour found ourselves
at Sachslen.</p>

<p>This village is very small, but at
once tells its own tale; for the
church stands, according to the
fashion of “holy places,” in a
large open space surrounded by
good-sized houses, that serve as
inns and resting-places for the
crowds of pilgrims who flock here
at stated periods. Now all was
quiet and the church nearly empty;
the Masses of the day&mdash;unfortunately
for us&mdash;were long since over.
After paying our visit to the Blessed
Sacrament we wandered through
the edifice, admiring its size and
beauty, but unable to discover any
sign of the shrine whose fame
had brought us hither. At length
George succeeded in finding the
sacristan, a wrinkled, toothless octogenarian,
who, as far as looks
went, seemed quite ancient enough
to have been himself a contemporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_839" id="Page_839">[839]</a></span>
of “Bruder Klaus.” His
German, too, was so intensely local,
and consequently, to us, obscure,
that we had the utmost difficulty in
understanding him. But he pointed
to the altar in the centre with an
inscription in golden letters on its
black marble frontal. And certainly
it was worth looking at; for
a more remarkable specimen of
phonetic spelling is seldom to be
found, exactly following the local
dialect, even in its total disregard
of grammar. On the other hand,
this earnest simplicity in such
strange contrast to the refined material
that perpetuates it is deeply
touching and in perfect keeping
with everything connected with
Blessed Nicholas and this pious
people. It ran thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Allhier Buwet die gebein des Seeligen</div>
<div class="verse">Bruder Claus von Flüe&mdash;dahero gesetzt da</div>
<div class="verse">Man die Kirche gebüwet anno 1679.”<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As soon as the aged sacristan felt
satisfied that we had read the lines,
without another word he drew back
the picture over the altar as he
might a curtain, and disclosed
“Bruder Klaus” himself confronting
us! Never shall I forget the
thrilling sensation of beholding the
hermit’s skeleton in kneeling posture
right above the tabernacle and
facing the congregation, clothed in
his coarse habit, his hands clasped
in prayer, the cavity of his eyes filled
by two large emeralds, his nose
by one enormous long, yellow topaz,
while in the centre of the ribs,
near his heart, hung a large jewelled
cross, and round his neck a
number of military orders. It was
startling! We had expected from
the word “gesetzt” to find him reposing
in a shrine, and should have
preferred, it must be confessed, to
have seen more refinement and delicacy
shown in the use of those precious
stones as ornamentation.
But were they not the precious
stones of simple, firm faith and true
love of God? This peasant population
never had any pretension to
“high art or learning.” Blessed
Nicholas himself had naught but
the refinement of that exalted piety
which in itself transcends even the
highest flights of human culture,
and is, after all, the “one thing
needful.” With such thoughts to
guide us we could only admire and
respect the desire, albeit crudely
expressed, to show reverence to
one whose own simple nature despised
those “earthly treasures.”
His countrymen, however, had that
deep “art and learning” which
taught them to appreciate Blessed
Nicholas’ devotion to the Blessed
Sacrament; for they could think of
no resting-place more dear to him
than that close to the dwelling
of his Lord. Tender piety, too,
prompted the offerings; but no votive
tablets recorded their stories, as
in the little church at Kaltbad, and
we longed in vain to know their
histories. The orders alone, we
discovered, had been won in different
countries by his descendants,
and have been offered up by them,
as well as various swords and trophies
by other Unterwaldeners, in
thanksgiving for the prayers and
protection of the saintly hermit.
A striking example of the enduring
value of a noble, self-denying, God-fearing
character it is thus to see
the aid of this simple peasant still
sought and the influence of his
memory so powerful on the minds
and better natures even of this
material age. It was impossible
not to pray that he may now more
than ever watch over his beloved
fellow-countrymen, and obtain for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_840" id="Page_840">[840]</a></span>
them that steadfastness in their
faith and principles which they so
sorely need during the terrible
struggle they are now passing
through. There is little else belonging
to Blessed Nicholas to be
seen&mdash;for was he not a hermit, and
the poorest of saints?&mdash;but in a case
near the wall the old clerk displayed
his rosary and another habit,
which we liked to fancy might
have been made from the piece of
stuff presented to him by the town
of Freyburg after his successful intervention
at the diet of Stanz.</p>

<p>Our thoughts now turned to his
hermitage at Ranft, but only to
meet with severe disappointment.
It was too far for “ladies to walk,”
said every one, and no horses could
be had without previous orders, of
which no one had once thought.
Had we only slept here, instead of
stopping at Sarnen, all would have
been easy, and we should, moreover,
have been able to have heard
Mass at the shrine. The “Engel”
of Sachslen was larger than, though
scarcely so inviting as, the “Golden
Eagle” of Sarnen, yet he would
at least have watched over our spiritual
interests; and “when one
undertakes a pilgrimage,” exclaimed
George, “ladies should despise
comforts.”</p>

<p>“It was Herr H&mdash;&mdash;’s plan,” retorted
Caroline, determined that we
should not be blamed, “and <em>we</em>
should not be ungrateful; for remember
that he had also to think
of us Protestants! All we can now
do is to warn other pilgrims, and
advise them to come on here
straight.”</p>

<p>It was provoking beyond measure
to be thus deprived by mismanagement
of this point in our
visit. But Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; and George
were determined not to give it up;
they would go on foot, and report
all to us, if only we would wait
patiently for a few hours. Where
was the use of further grumbling?
Like good children, we cried out,
“What can’t be cured must be endured,”
and, summoning all the
piety we could command to our
aid, we offered up the disappointment
in the spirit of true pilgrims
in honor of “Bruder Klaus,” and
bade our friends “God speed” and
depart.</p>

<p>Anna and the two young ladies,
soon discovering pretty points of
view, settled themselves to sketch,
while Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; and I took a ramble
through the village. Though
without any pretension to an Alpine
character, none is more genuinely
Swiss than Sachslen. Leaving
the square, we wandered among
the detached houses, scattered here
and there in the most capricious
manner on the slope of a hill that
rises gently behind, and which, dotted
with timber throughout its fresh
pastures, forms a most beautiful
background to the picture. The
wood-work, delicately, nay elaborately,
carved, the windows glazed
in many instances with bull’s-eye
glass, the low rooms with heavy
cross-beams, are all many centuries
old, perhaps from the very days of
Blessed Nicholas; but beyond all
doubt the “Holy Cross,” “Engel,”
and other hostelries, of which the
place is chiefly composed, owe their
origin to his memory. Photographs
of the church and the hermitage
hung in the window of the “library”
of the village, which was opened
for us, after some delay, by an
active, tidy matron. “These are
quiet days and few purchasers,” she
said in an apologetic tone. “But
the ladies would find it very different
on feast days; on the 21st of
March above all. Then ten and
twelve thousand people often come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_841" id="Page_841">[841]</a></span>
from all quarters; every house far
and near is full, stalls are erected
in the square, and the church is
crowded from morning till night.
This is the <cite>Litany</cite> chanted during
the processions,” she added, handing
us a small book, which also
contained “Prayers by Brother
Klaus,” collected from old writings
by a priest. Nothing could be
more beautiful or simple than the
latter; but the <cite>Litany</cite> in particular
was a pre-eminently striking composition,
every sentence showing
that remarkable union of patriotism
and piety which runs through the
whole being of every Swiss Catholic.
It begins by invoking the hermit,
simply as “Blessed Brother
Klaus,” to “Pray for us,” and, going
on through every phase of his
life, implores his intercession in a
more emphatic manner wherever
his love of country or of justice
had been most conspicuous. And
here it must be remembered that
Blessed Nicholas has as yet only
been beatified. Hence those who
style him “saint” transgress the
proper limits, which are never forgotten
by the Swiss themselves.
For this reason it is that in no
prayer is he ever addressed except
as “Blessed Nicholas,” and in popular
parlance ranks no higher than
their “dear Bruder Klaus.” But
that he may some day be canonized
is the fond hope of every Swiss
Catholic, and one, it is said, which
can be justified by many miracles.</p>

<p>Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; and I carried off the
<cite>Litany</cite>, etc., and, sitting down on a
bench near the church, drew out
other books we had with us, determined
to refresh our memories regarding
this great servant of our
Lord.</p>

<p>Of these, two small documents,
written during his lifetime, are the
most interesting. One is a <cite>Memoir</cite>
by John von Waldheim, a gentleman
from Halle in Germany, giving
an account of his visit to Brother
Nicholas in February, 1474,
and found in the Wolfenbüttel
Library; the other a similar report
of his pilgrimage to the Hermit of
Ranft, addressed to the clergy and
magistrates of the town of Nuremberg,
by Albert von Bonstetten,
canon of Einsiedeln, whom the historian,
J. von Müller, calls “the
most learned Swiss of his age,” and
found in the archives of the town
of Nuremberg in 1861, and wherein
he states that, “as so many fables
had been circulated about the hermit,
he felt convinced they would
be glad to know what he had himself
seen.” Other contemporaries
also allude to their visits; but
these two, though short, bear such
internal evidence of truth in the
quaint freshness of their style and
language, place us so completely
face to face with all concerned, give
such a picture of Blessed Nicholas’
humility and unsophisticated nature,
and such an insight into the
habits of thought of that period,
that no others equal them, and we
can only regret that space does not
permit of more than merely a passing
quotation.</p>

<p>All authorities agree that Blessed
Nicholas was born in this then obscure
hamlet on March 21, 1417.
Zschokke, however, alone mentions
that his family name was
Löwenbrugger&mdash;a fact ignored by
others, so completely had “Von
der Flüe,” or “of the Rocks,” become
his own, even during his
lifetime. Yet all his biographers
begin by explaining that this cognomen
“came from his living at the
rocks of Ranft.” Bonstetten also
naïvely asks “how any inhabitant
of this region can avoid coming
into the world except under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_842" id="Page_842">[842]</a></span>
some one rock or another.” His
parents were very poor, and Nicholas
labored hard, in the fields especially,
from his tenderest years.
Grown to manhood, he married
young, had ten children, and became
distinguished above his fellows,
in his public and private
capacity, as “a model son, husband,
father, and citizen.” He even served
as soldier, like others, in the
Thurgau war, where he was equally
noted for deeds of valor and for
compassion towards the sick and
wounded. So high was his reputation
amongst his neighbors that
they several times elected him
Landamman and resorted to him
as arbitrator in their disputes.
“The virtues he displayed to all
around him,” writes Bonstetten,
“were quite marvellous. For a long
time he continued to lead this
honorable existence, considerate,
affectionate, true to every one, importunate
to none.” At length a
yearning for greater perfection became
stronger than all else, and at
fifty years of age he determined to
seek for closer union with his Lord.
Several of his children were already
married and settled in the neighborhood.
To those that remained
and to his wife he handed over the
house that he had built and the
fields he had cultivated from early
youth upwards, and, taking leave
of his family and of all that he held
most dear, he left his home for
ever. Von Waldheim states that he
at first intended merely to wander
as a pilgrim from one holy place to
another, but that, “on reaching
Basel, he had a revelation, which
made him choose a hermit’s life in
preference, and in consequence of
which he turned back to Unterwalden
and to his own house. He
did not, however, allow himself to
be seen by wife, children, or any
one, but, passing the night in his
stables, he started again at dawn,
penetrated for about a quarter of a
mile into the forest behind Sachslen,
gathered some branches of
trees, roofed them with leaves, and
there took up his abode.” At all
events, it was in this spot, known as
“the solitude of Ranft,” at the
opening of the Melchthal, that he
passed the remaining twenty years
of his saintly life.</p>

<p>But although <em>he</em> had withdrawn
from the world, that world soon
followed him. Before long the
fame of his sanctity spread abroad;
above all, rumors were circulated
that he never tasted earthly food,
and that his life was sustained solely
by the Blessed Eucharist, which
some authorities say he received
once a month, others on every
Friday. This celestial favor, however,
was at first the cause of great
suffering to Blessed Nicholas. Calumnies
were heaped upon him,
insults offered. Still, he remained
impassive, taking no heed of men.
Some would not doubt him. “Why
should they suppose that a man
who had so long lived amongst
them, whose honor had been so
well tried and recognized, and who
had abandoned the world merely to
lead a hard life in the desert, would
now try to deceive them?” But
others declared that he only wanted
to impose on the vulgar, and that
he had food brought to him secretly.
“What did the landamman and
elders do,” says Bonstetten, “in
order to prevent their being accused
of playing the part of dupes?
They selected trusty men, made
them take an oath to speak the
truth, and placed them as guards
round the hermitage, to watch
whether food was brought to Nicholas
from any quarter, or whether
he procured any for himself.” For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_843" id="Page_843">[843]</a></span>
a whole month this severe surveillance
was maintained; but in the
end it only proved in a most convincing
manner that the hermit
neither ate nor drank anything except
that nourishment with which
our Lord himself provided him.
Two Protestant writers, J. von
Müller and Bullinger, give details
of this inquiry, of which they raise
no doubt; and some years after it
took place, during the lifetime of
Blessed Nicholas, the following entry
was made in the public archives
of Sachslen:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Be it known to all Christians, that
in the year 1417 was born at Sachslen,
Nicholas von der Flüe; that, brought up
in the same parish, he quitted father,
mother, brother, wife, and children to
come to live in the solitude called
Ranft; that there he has been sustained
by the aid of God, without taking any
food, for the last eighteen years, enjoying
all his faculties at this moment of our
writing, and leading a most holy life.
This we have ourselves seen, and this
we here affirm in all truth. Let us, then,
pray the Lord to give him eternal life
whenever he shall deign to call him from
this world.”</p>

</div>

<p>As a natural consequence of this
investigation, a strong reaction at
once occurred. The villagers built
him a chapel with a cell adjoining,
and soon the Bishop of Constance
came to consecrate it.</p>

<p>But the bishop was also determined
to test the fact of his total
abstinence, and ordered him to eat
in his presence. Various are the
versions concerning this event, the
majority asserting that Blessed Nicholas
was seized with convulsions
the instant he swallowed the first
mouthful. But J. von Waldheim,
who seems to have experienced no
difficulty in asking direct questions,
gives us the hermit’s own words
on the subject, brimful of truthfulness
and humility. After stating
that he had been entertaining Nicholas
by an account of his own
pilgrimages to holy places, and
amongst others to the sanctuary of
Blessed Mary Magdalen, in whose
honor the Ranft chapel was dedicated,
and having brought tears
into the eyes of the venerable hermit
by the beautiful legends regarding
her which he told him, Waldheim
proceeds:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I said: ‘Dear Brother Nicholas! in
my own country, as well as here, I have
heard it maintained that you have neither
eaten nor drunk anything for many years
past. What may I believe?’ ‘God
knows it!’ he answered, and then continued:
‘Certain folk asserted that the
life I lead proceeds not from God, but
from the evil spirit. In consequence my
Lord the Bishop of Constance blessed
three pieces of bread and a drop of wine,
and then presented them to me. If I
could eat or drink, he thought I should
be justified; if not, there could no longer
be any doubt that I was under the
influence of the devil. Then my Lord
the Bishop of Constance asked me what
thing I considered the most estimable
and meritorious in Christianity. ‘Holy
obedience,’ I answered. Then he replied:
‘If obedience be the most estimable
and meritorious thing, then I
command you, in the name of that holy
virtue, to eat these three pieces of bread
and to drink this wine.’ I besought my
lord to dispense me from this, because
this act would grieve me to excess. I
implored him several times, but he continued
inflexible, and I was obliged to
obey, to eat and to drink.’ I then asked
Brother Nicholas,” continued Waldheim:
‘And since that time you have
neither eaten nor drunk any thing?’ But
I could extract no other answer from
him save the three words, ‘God knows
it.’”</p>

</div>

<p>Numberless were the reports concerning
his mysterious ways. He
often went to Einsiedeln, yet it was
said that no one ever met him on
the road!</p>

<p>“How does he get there?” asks
Waldheim. “God alone knows.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_844" id="Page_844">[844]</a></span>
His appearance, too, was said to be
unearthly.</p>

<p>Waldheim had heard, too, that
his body was emaciated and devoid
of natural warmth, his hands icy,
and his aspect like that of a corpse.
He lays particular stress, therefore,
on the fact that Nicholas possessed
a natural bodily heat, like
any other man, “in his hands especially,
which I and my valet
Kunz touched several times. His
complexion was neither yellow nor
pale, but that of one in excellent
health; his humor pleasant, his
conversation, acts, and gestures
those of an affable, communicative,
sociable, gay being looking at every
thing from the bright side. His
hair is brown, his features regular,
his skin good, his face thin, his
figure straight and slight, his German
agreeable to listen to.”</p>

<p>A few years later Père Bonstetten
heightens this picture by a
minuteness that rivals the <i lang="fr">signalements</i>
of old-fashioned passports.
He describes Brother Nicholas as
being “of fine stature, extremely
thin, and of a brown complexion,
covered with freckles; his dark
hair tinged with gray, and, though
not abundant, falling in disorder
on his shoulders; his beard in like
manner, and about an inch long;
his eyes not remarkable, except that
the white is in due proportion; his
teeth white and regular; and his
nose in harmony with the rest of
his face.”</p>

<p>And as we read this clear description,
Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; and I could
not help regretting that posterity
had not been satisfied with such
a recollection, without having endeavored
by emeralds and precious
stones to fill up the voids which
nature had since created; but when
the motives had been so pure and
loving, it was not for us to find
fault with the manner of their reverence,
nor do more than admire its
earnestness and simplicity.</p>

<p>There seems to have been a certain
difficulty in obtaining admittance
to the hermit; for even Père
Bonstetten had to be introduced
by the landamman, and Von Waldheim
took with him the Curé
of Kerns. Brother Nicholas, it
must be remembered, though an
anchorite, was still not ordained;
hence a priest was to him always a
welcome visitor. His family, too,
seem at all times to have had free
access to him. Both writers commenced
their visits by hearing
Mass in his little chapel, where
Brother Nicholas knelt behind a
grating; but after their introduction
he let them into his adjoining cell.
Here he impressed them deeply by
his humility, politeness, and gentleness,
and both remark his sweet-toned
voice and his kindliness in
shaking hands with every one, “not
forgetting a single person.” Père
Bonstetten, more than Waldheim,
seems to have retained his self-possession;
for he says: “I kept my
eyes wide open, looking right and
left around the room, attentively
considering everything. The cell
was not half warm. It had two
small windows, but no sleeping
place, unless a raised portion at
one end may be used for that purpose.”
Nor could he see a table,
nor furniture of any kind, nor sign
even of a mattress on which this
servant of God could ever repose.
But he dwells with emphasis on his
simplicity and truthfulness, saying
that he answered his many questions,
“not in the fashion of a hypocrite,
but simply as became an unlettered
man.”</p>

<p>And like these visitors came others
from every quarter to see and
consult him&mdash;magistrates to ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_845" id="Page_845">[845]</a></span>
the advice of one who, in the words
of the <cite>Litany</cite>, had been like that
“just judge whose decisions were
altogether dictated by conscience
and justice,” and that “wise statesman
who administered his offices
solely for the honor of God and
the good of his fellow-men”; soldiers
to see the “brave warrior who
took up arms for God and fatherland,
and was a model of virtue to
the army”; those in affliction to beg
the prayers of that “most perfect
follower of Jesus, who, by meditation
on the life and sufferings of
our Lord, had been so like unto
him”; sinners to implore that
“pious hermit, who left the world
from desire of greater perfection,”
to teach them how to subdue their
passions. For all and each he had
some word of comfort and exhortation.
One of these pilgrims was
so captivated by his heavenly admonitions
that he resolved to remain
near Blessed Nicholas and
lead the same life. He built himself
a chapel and cell close by, and
soon became remarkable for his
sanctity; but his antecedents are
veiled in mystery, and he has descended
to posterity simply as
“Brother Ulrich, once a Bavarian
gentleman.” Blessed Nicholas,
however, evidently held him in
high regard; for, after praising him
warmly, he urged both Waldheim
and Père Bonstetten to visit him
before leaving Ranft. The naïve
Waldheim takes no pains to conceal
that he was prejudiced against
poor Ulrich by reason of the mystery
surrounding him; although “he
is educated,” he says,“whereas
Brother Nicholas is a simple layman
who does not know how to
read.” The learned monk of Einsiedeln,
on the contrary, is at once
prepossessed in his favor by the
tincture of culture which he quickly
detects. He notes that Ulrich
“talks more and shows less dislike
for the society of men than
Brother Nicholas. No doubt,”
he adds, “because he is more instructed.
He is somewhat of a
Latin scholar. At the same time,
his books are in German. He
showed them to me. I think that
I perceived the <cite>Gospels</cite> and the
<cite>Lives of the Fathers</cite> translated into
German”&mdash;a fact which we may
further note as a remarkable proof
that such translations of the Gospels
into the vernacular, mentioned
thus incidentally by Père Bonstetten,
were common before the days
of printing, in the very midst of the
so-called “dark ages.”</p>

<p>Amongst the many traits for
which Blessed Nicholas was distinguished,
Père Bonstetten records
that conformity to the will of God
and love of peace were pre-eminent.
“He preaches submission
and peace&mdash;that peace which he
never ceases to recommend to the
confederates.” And a time was
coming when all his power and influence
would be needed to preserve
it. Some years after these
two accounts were written, and
while Blessed Nicholas and Brother
Ulrich were praying and fasting in
their “solitude at Ranft,” great
deeds were being done in other
parts of Switzerland. The battles
of Grandson and Morat were fought
and won, Charles the Bold driven
back into Burgundy, and the rich
spoils of his army became the property
of the Swiss. But what union
and heroism had gained victory
and prosperity well-nigh destroyed.
Soleure and Freyburg, in virtue of
their hard fighting, claimed admission
into the confederacy, which
claim the older states disdainfully
rejected; while the enormous Burgundian
booty likewise became a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_846" id="Page_846">[846]</a></span>
fruitful source of discord. Numerous
diets were held, without avail,
for the settlement of these questions,
each only increasing the trouble.
At length a diet assembled at Stanz
purposely in order to come to a
final decision; but the disputes
reached such a pitch that the deputies
were about to separate, although
the return to their homes would
have been the signal for civil war.
Blessed Nicholas, though so near,
knew nothing of these proceedings
until one morning, when one of his
oldest and most esteemed friends
unexpectedly arrived at the hermitage.
It was the curé of Stanz;
a worthy priest and a true patriot,
who, in despair at the state of affairs,
and mindful of Nicholas’ patriotism
and love of peace, came to implore
his help. Without an instant’s
delay the hermit took up his staff,
walked across the paths he knew so
well, and marched straight into the
hall at Stanz where the deputies
were assembled. Zschokke, the
Protestant writer, thus describes
the scene:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All with one accord rose from their
seats as they beheld in their midst this
old man of emaciated aspect, yet full of
youthful vigor, and deeply venerated by
every one. He spoke to them with the
dignity of a messenger from heaven, and
in the name of that God who had given
so many victories to them and to their
fathers, he preached peace and concord.
‘You have become strong,’ he said,
‘through the might of united arms. Will
you now separate them for the sake of
miserable booty? Never let surrounding
countries hear of this! Ye towns! do
not grieve the older confederates by insisting
on the rights of citizens. Rural
cantons! remember that Soleure and
Freyburg have fought hard beside you,
and receive them into fellowship. Confederates!
take care, on the other hand,
not to enlarge your boundaries unduly!
Avoid all transactions with foreigners!
Beware of divisions! Far be it from you
ever to prefer money to the fatherland.’
This and much more did Nicholas von
der Flüe say, and all hearts were so
deeply touched, so stirred, by the words
of the mighty hermit, that in one single
hour every disputed point was settled.
Soleure and Freyburg were that day admitted
into the confederacy; old treaties
and compacts were renewed; and at the
suggestion of the pious Nicholas it was
decided that in future all conquered territory
should be distributed amongst the
cantons, but booty divided amongst individuals!
This done,” continues Zschokke,
“the hermit returned to his wilderness,
each deputy to his canton. Joy abounded
everywhere. From all the church-towers
of the land festive peals announced
the glad tidings, from the furthest
Alps even unto the Jura.”</p>

</div>

<p>The cantons vied with each other
in the effort to express their gratitude
to Blessed Nicholas. But in
vain; he would take nothing from
them except a few ornaments for
his small chapel. Freyburg alone
was favored by his acceptance of
a piece of stuff to repair his worn-out
habit, which was then in shreds;
and this it was which we liked to
think identical with the relic shown to
us by the old sacristan in the church
at Sachslen. Bern, in a spirit widely
different from that of its degenerate
posterity, presented him with
a chalice, which elicited from him
a letter full of patriotism and tender
Christian feeling: “Be careful,”
he writes in answer, “to maintain
peace and concord amongst you;
for you know how acceptable this
is to Him from whom all good proceeds.
He who leads a godly life
always preserves peace; nay, more,
God is that sovereign peace in
whom all can repose. Protect the
widows and orphans, as you have
hitherto done. If you prosper in
this world, return thanks to God,
and pray that he may grant you a
continuance of the same happiness
in the next. Repress public vice
and be just to all. Deeply imprint
in your hearts the remembrance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_847" id="Page_847">[847]</a></span>
the Passion of our Lord Jesus
Christ. It will console and strengthen
you in the hour of adversity.”
Then, as if in prophetic strain to
the proud town, he adds: “Many
people in our day, tempted by the
devil, are troubled with doubts on
faith. But why have any doubts?
The faith is the same to-day that it
ever has been.”</p>

<p>What wonder, after all this, that,
in spite of himself, Blessed Nicholas
became the arbiter of Switzerland
during the few remaining years of
his life? Every dispute was referred
to him, and, as one writer
adds, “In that solitude, where he
thought only of serving God, by
the simple fact of his sanctity he became
of all his compatriots the most
pleasing to God and the most useful
to his neighbor.” At length
the holy hermit lay down on the
bare ground, which had so long
been his couch, and, full of years
and honor, he “fell asleep in the
Lord” on the 21st of March, 1487&mdash;on
the very day that he had fulfilled
seventy years of his most spotless
and saintly life.</p>

<p>We had just reached this point,
when, looking up, we beheld Mr.
C&mdash;&mdash; and George advancing and exclaiming:
“Such a pity you did not
come&mdash;such a pity!” Breathlessly
they told us that the distance had
proved trifling; they found horses,
too, on the way, and everything had
been deeply interesting. The road
had passed near “Bruder Klaus’”
fields, crossed the rushing stream
mentioned by Von Waldheim; and
not only had they visited the
chapel and cell of Blessed Nicholas,
but also that of Brother Ulrich,
exactly as described by the two
mediæval pilgrims. The stone
used by Blessed Nicholas as his
pillow is there preserved; both
places, kept in excellent repair and
attended by a priest who resides on
the spot, are much frequented and
full of votive offerings of various
kinds. At once it became a question
of our starting thither, even at
that advanced hour. Had Anna
and I been alone, we should have
upset all previous arrangements for
this purpose; but charity and forbearance
are the virtues most needed
and most frequently brought
into play when travelling with a
large party. Smothering our annoyance,
therefore, a second time,
as best we could, and making a
mental resolve to return some future
day and see with our own
eyes what our friends so vividly described,
we adjourned to the Engel,
and did full justice to the meal
which its pleasant-faced hostess had
prepared for us. In another hour
we were on the road back to Stanz,
but this time across the hills.
Kerns, now speaking to our minds
of Von Waldheim and Père Bonstetten,
was first passed, succeeded
before long by St. Jacob and its
plain, the scene of the terrible battle
with the French in 1798; and in
two and a half hours the comfortable
cottages of Nidwalden had
gradually developed into, and terminated
in, the pretty houses of its
capital, Stanz. Here we now halted,
in order to repair our omission
of yesterday by a visit to the Rathhaus.
It was opened for us after
some delay by a bluff Nidwaldener,
whose German was as unintelligible
as that of the Sachslen clerk.
But, in like manner, he supplied the
defect by pointing to two curious
and very ancient paintings which
hung in the entrance lobby, one
representing Blessed Nicholas taking
leave of his wife and family before
he went to Ranft, the other his
appearance at the diet here. The
deputies in the painting have all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_848" id="Page_848">[848]</a></span>
risen, whilst the emaciated hermit
is addressing them boldly and earnestly.
As we proceeded into the
hall close by, it required no stretch
of imagination to fancy that the
scene had but just occurred in that
spot, so exactly is the room of the
same shape, the chairs and table of
the same pattern, and all placed in
the same position as in the old picture.
Though not the same building,
one may well believe that the
present is only a reproduction of
the former town-hall, simple and
unpretending as it is, and yet invested
with such deep interest.
Three sides of the hall are hung
with portraits of the landammans
since 1521, and the fourth is decorated
by various banners won on
different patriotic occasions. Of
these, we notice one that was taken
at the battle of Kappel, where
Zwingle met his death; another
sent to the Unterwaldeners by
Pope Julius II.; and a third recently
presented by Zschokke, a native
of these parts, representing William
Tell shooting the apple off his son’s
head&mdash;thus giving the sanction of
this grave and graphic historian to
the story we all so much love.
Long did we linger in the hall, full
of the day’s impressions; but the
light was waning, and it was necessary
to depart. Ere we reached
Buochs the sun had set; it was dark
when the steamer came up to the
quay; and night had closed when
we arrived at Brunnen and entered
the brilliantly-lighted hall of the
Walstätter Hof.</p>

<h3>THE SCIENTIFIC GOBLIN.</h3>

<p>By one of those freaks of fortune
rare even in fairyland, the small
people known as the Odomites had,
in order to escape being devoured
by a strolling giant named Googloom,
made him their king. This
ogre was of so wonderful an ugliness
that babes died at the sight
of him, and men and maids had
gone into convulsions of merriment;
but the majority of the Odomites,
blessed with a wholesome fear, dared
no more than laugh in their
sleeves at bare memory of his face,
avoiding as much as they could to
see him. However, to make sure
that all his people were as sober as
himself, King Googloom issued an
edict defining laughter as treason,
under any pretext to be punished
with death by slow torture. In
cases of young and pretty maids
this sentence was varied by the fact
that the giant himself ate them up.
Yet, spite of the terrors of his decree,
hundreds of his subjects perished
for want of self-control; and
one man, whose fate became renowned
as that of a voluntary martyr
to free expression, died laughing
involuntarily, notwithstanding
his tortures, the giant Googloom
being a witness of his execution.</p>

<p>When the realm of Odom was
thus rid of all rebellion in the shape
of quips, jokes, pranks, tricks, antics,
capers, smiles, laughs, caricatures,
chuckles, grimaces, Googloom
yawned and rolled his eyes in
a manner fearful to see, and, leaving
his throne, made a tour through
his dominions. Not a soul dared
so much as smile in obeisance to
him. Though he made his ugliest
faces, to such a degree that the passing
ravens were scared, not a single
Odomite lifted up his head to grin
for a moment. Over all the land
reigned the shadow of funlessness.
Googloom had become a dreadful
chimera, a nightmare. Hardly
knowing it, his people grew lean
and pined away.</p>

<p>Googloom himself began to be
weary of the prevailing dulness,
even while he boasted that the land
was never so sober and its population
so orderly. “When will the
old times return,” asked his sages
of themselves, “when the land
laughed and grew fat?” Googloom
eyed with contempt the bones
of the children that were served up
at his banquets; and one day, seeing
that the leanness of his people
had extended to their crops, and
yet unwilling to alter his decrees,
mockingly proclaimed that anybody
who could make him laugh
at his own expense, or make anybody
else laugh on the same terms,
should have the privilege of laughing
whenever he pleased.</p>

<p>There was at this time living in
one of the mountains of Odom a
famous goblin named Gigag. His
exceeding knowledge and invention,
assisted by good-nature, had made
him famous in the country round
about; and notwithstanding the
prejudices of some of the Od people,
he was permitted to benefit
them in various ways. For instance,
he made them a stove which gave
them both heat and light; an instrument
that produced exquisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_850" id="Page_850">[850]</a></span>
melodies whether you could play it
or not; an accordeon that invented
tunes of its own accord, for the help
of composers; a portable bridge to
be flung over chasms at pleasure;
a drink that gave men’s eyes the
power of microscopes, and another
that inspired them with the capacity
of telescopes; a fertilizer that
brought up crops in seven days
with care; a flying-machine to save
all who laughed; and a pill to cure
headache, heartache, rheumatism,
dropsy, palsy, dyspepsia, epilepsy,
consumption&mdash;everything short of
death itself&mdash;and to cause lost hair,
eyes, teeth, legs, and arms to grow
again. There was also rumor that
the goblin Gigag had tunnelled the
whole kingdom through, and that
goblin steeds and people could now
travel at will an underground thoroughfare.
But, for all these things,
the Odomites were no better than
before. Their taste in music was
bad; they were blind as bats to
their interests; they tumbled over
precipices; they neglected their
crops, and were too stupid to fly, if
not too dull to laugh; and headaches,
heartaches, and palsies were
much the same as ever, because
they disliked to take a pill that was
not sugar-coated. In the end the
scientific Gigag was thought to be
a goblin of genius&mdash;one of those
fine spirits who are always doing
magnificent things to no purpose.
Had he relied upon the effect of his
mechanical or chemical exploits to
make his way in the world, the
well-meaning goblin would certainly
have made a mistake. What,
then, was the secret of that extraordinary
power which the goblin
Gigag exercised over the minds of
those who came in contact with
him? It was his expression.</p>

<p>All the variety of which the goblin
countenance is susceptible seemed
to be concentrated in that of
Gigag. But its peculiarity was
this: that his eyes grew piercing
and dazzling at will, while his teeth
enlarged, his mouth curved, and
his nose elongated and turned at
pleasure. It may well be supposed
that no Odomite could resist a
smile or survive the scorn of a
countenance so effective; and we
can only ascribe it to Gigag’s known
forbearance that the so-called anticachination
laws of Googloom were
not a thousand times violated. But
patience has its bounds. The national
dulness which made Googloom
yawn and sneer made Gigag
almost swear. The reigning condition
must be put an end to,
or science itself would be powerless
at length to amuse or to cure.
Accordingly, he sped through his
underground road, and came up at
court by a secret path. Wearing a
long, conical hat and a fanciful
jacket, with doublet and hose, and
elongating his features while he
stretched himself to his full height,
he stepped into the presence of the
king, knocking down by the way a few
insolent attendants who had excited
his gaze. Bristling the few hairs of
his upper lip, which resembled the
mustache of Grimalkin, and bowing
with the most obsequious of
smiles, the goblin Gigag stood before
the giant Googloom.</p>

<p>Never had that ogre seen a figure
at once so lean and long, and a
face so bright and cunning. He
would have ordered it at once to
his darkest dungeons, were it not
for an unaccountable fascination
which forced him to listen to Gigag
while he proposed not only to make
Googloom laugh at his own expense,
but to make everybody else
laugh at him on the same terms,
and to solve the problem of perpetual
motion by making the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_851" id="Page_851">[851]</a></span>
of Odom merry ever afterwards.
“I presume,” said he, “you have
heard the story of the pig’s fiddle”;
and he proceeded to tell a tale
which for wit and fun would have
made a thousand unicorns die laughing.
But on the giant it had either
no effect at all or had only raised
his spirits to the point of being
serious. Gigag clearly saw that he
had failed by trusting to the merits
of his story instead of using his
great weapon of expression. “This
is no ordinary case,” said the goblin
to himself. “The problem is
to make an immense creature laugh
who has nothing of the sort in him.
Perhaps the best thing to do is to
torture him till he laughs in despair.”
Spite of the giant’s disposition
to put his visitor at once to
the torture, he agreed that the accomplished
goblin should call next
day, and make him laugh, or else
die by slow boiling. This the goblin
heard with a mixture of scorn
and amusement, curling his nose
and showing his teeth in an aristocratic
manner.</p>

<p>As the cunning Gigag left the
king’s chamber to go to his quarters
in a corner of the great palace,
he took good care to scatter about
two scientifically-prepared powders,
one of which dissolved in the air,
producing sleep, and the other by a
similar change entered the nostrils,
producing throughout the body
tickling sensations and a disposition
to low chuckling. When Gigag
again came before Googloom, it was
seen that none of the royal guards
were fit for duty, and that throughout
the palace and its grounds the
disposition among courtiers, retainers,
servants, pages, to laugh in
their sleeves at the smallest incitement,
was unmistakable. Even the
kitchen cats had caught the infection,
and mewed dispersedly.</p>

<p>“Now, O great Googloom!” said
Gigag when all the court had assembled,
“let me in three acts
essay to complete that transformation
by which thy people’s despair
shall be turned to joy, and thy
laughing face shall behold its own
merriment.” At this moment the
giant shook like one who is tickled
all over, but cannot laugh, experiencing
the greatest tortures without
knowing what to make of them. To
divert him the goblin related his
favorite story of the merry owl,
with such catcalls, crowing, mincing,
and mewing, and withal such
unearthly jest, that a thousand dogs
would have died if they did not
laugh. What wonder, then, that
long before the witty Gigag had
concluded a favorite page was so
wrought upon by chuckling that,
bursting his buttons, at length he
laughed right out, which had such
an effect upon all assembled that
they chuckled, and then roared.
“Ho, guards!” cried Googloom;
but Gigag easily drew his attention
to the second part of the programme&mdash;for
the goblin had actually
brought the giant to the point
of complacency. “I propose now,”
he said, “to show you the most
ridiculous countenance that was
ever seen, except one.” Hereupon
he diminished and heightened his
figure at intervals, while he curved
his nose by degrees, lengthened his
teeth as he pleased, and put upon
his mouth such an expression of
maddening humor that his spectators
gasped with laughing, to the
vast confusion of the helpless giant,
who vowed with a feeble smile that
the gifted Gigag was certainly the
most ingenious man he ever knew.</p>

<p>“Nothing will serve you, I perceive,
O beautiful Googloom! except
the light of science; and now
I will show you the face of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_852" id="Page_852">[852]</a></span>
most ridiculous man that ever was
born.” Accordingly, by means of
an instrument which he had invented,
Gigag reflected upon a
large canvas the features of Googloom!
Unwittingly the giant
smiled, for he had never seen so
preposterous a face before; and
the more he smiled, the more ridiculous
it grew, till at last, after
the giant himself had given way
to laughter, it was so horribly funny
that the whole court shrieked
and shrieked again, and Googloom,
losing all control, roared
with such a volume and power
of merriment that he toppled off
his throne, and was crushed under
its ruins. The people, seeing the
faces of the courtiers and of each
other, caught an infectious laughter,
which prevailed throughout all
Odom, and did not by any means
cease when the goblin Gigag was
called to the throne, and the reign
of science began.</p>

Modernes.</span> Par l’Abbé François
Chesnel, Vicaire-Général de Quimper.

</div>

<p>Every age has its special errors and its
special manifestations of the truth precisely
opposite to those errors. The
special errors of the present age may be
well summed up under one formula,
which we find on p. 335 of the Abbé
Chesnel’s work bearing the title placed
at the head of this notice: “The pretended
incompetence of God and his representatives
in the order of human
things, whether scientific or social.” The
system which springs from this fundamental
notion has received the name of
Liberalism. In contradiction to it, the
authority of God and the church over
those matters which are included in the
order of human things, is the truth
which in our day has been the special
object of inculcation, definition, explanation,
and defence on the part of the Catholic
Church and her most enlightened
advocates. A great number of the very
finest productions of our contemporary
Catholic writers in books, pamphlets,
and periodicals, treat of themes and
topics connected with this branch of the
great controversy between Catholic truth
and universal error. The volume just
published by the Abbé Chesnel is particularly
remarkable among these for
simplicity, lucidity, and moderation in
its statements, and for its adaptation to
the understanding of the great mass of
intelligent and educated readers, who are
unable to profit by any treatises presupposing
a great amount of knowledge and
thought on abstruse matters. The form
of dialogue helps the author and the
reader very much in respect to the
facility and simplicity of the work of
giving and receiving elementary instruction
on the subjects contained within the
volume. The other topics besides the
particular one we are about to mention
are handled very much in the
same manner by M. Chesnel as by
other sound and able writers, and
require no special remark. Thank
God! our instructed American Catholics
are not inclined to bury themselves in
what the author happily styles “the fog of
liberalism,” in so far as this confuses the
view of the rights of the church and the
Holy See in respect to the usurpations of
the civil power and the rebellions of private
judgment. We have turned with a
more particular interest to that part of the
volume which treats of the nature, origin,
acquisition, and loss of sovereign rights
by the possessors of political power in
the state. This is one of the most difficult
topics in the department of ethics,
and one seldom handled, in our opinion,
so well as by our author. To a certain
extent sound Catholic writers agree, and
the principles maintained are proved with
ease to the satisfaction of right-minded
students. That political power is from
God, that human rights are from God,
that an authority certainly legitimate
cannot be resisted within its lawful domain
without sin, are so many first principles
universally accepted and easily
proved. But when the sources and criteria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_856" id="Page_856">[856]</a></span>
of legitimacy are in question, there
is far less agreement even among those
who reject liberalism, and much less facility
of laying down and proving propositions
in a satisfactory manner. The
ingenious and learned Dr. Laing, in his
little book entitled <cite>Whence do Kings Derive
the Right to Rule?</cite> in our opinion
sustains most extravagant theories regarding
the divine right of monarchs.
On the other hand, we are not entirely
satisfied with the reasonings of the very
able and brilliant Dublin Reviewer on
the principles of legitimacy. In fact, we
have not seen the subject handled in a
perfectly thorough and satisfactory manner
by any author writing in the English
language. M. Chesnel is not exhaustive,
but, so far as his scope in writing permits
him to develop his subject, he seems to us
remarkably clear and judicious. The beginning
of sovereignty he traces to the
parental expanding into the patriarchal
authority. Acquisition of lawful sovereignty
he refers to inheritance, election,
and just conquest. The rehabilitation
of a sovereignty unjustly acquired
he refers to the accession of the right of
a nation to the possession of the goods
which have become dependent on the
peaceable maintenance of a <i lang="la">de facto</i> sovereignty,
sanctioned by a common consent.
The possessor who has been unjustly
despoiled of his sovereignty <i lang="la">de jure</i>
by one who has become sovereign <i lang="la">de facto</i>
evidently loses his right as soon as it is
transferred lawfully to this spoliator or
his heirs in the manner indicated. The
author, as we think unnecessarily, resorts
to the supposition that he is supposed to
cede it, because he cannot reasonably
maintain it. He adds, however, that
if he does not cede it he nevertheless
loses it, which seems to us to make his
cession or non-cession wholly irrelevant
and without effect. It is lost by the prevalence
of a higher right on the part of
the nation. Nevertheless, we think that
until a permanent and stable union of
the welfare of the nation with the right
of the new dynasty is effected, the former
sovereign right may in certain cases remain
in abeyance, and therefore revive
again in the future. This appears to us to
be exemplified in the case of the rights
of Don Carlos to the throne of Spain, and
of the Comte de Chambord to the throne
of France. Strictly, in themselves, their
rights have been in abeyance, and remain
imperfect, until the national welfare, sustained
by a sound and powerful part of
the body politic, demands their restitution
and actually effects the same. In
such cases there is always more or less
doubt about the real sense of the better
and sounder part of the nation, and about
the best settlement of conflicting claims
for the common good. And hence it is
that the best men may differ, and conscientiously
espouse opposite sides, when
a nation is in an unsettled and divided
state respecting its sovereignty.</p>

<p>In respect to the relation of the state
to the church, the author has some very
just and sagacious remarks on the peculiar
condition of things in our own republic,
quite in accordance with the views
which have been expressed by our soundest
American Catholic writers. We conclude
our criticism by quoting a few
passages:</p>

<p>“The religious system existing in the
United States does not resemble, either
in its origin or in its applications, that
which the liberal sect imposes on the
Catholic peoples of Europe. The American
population, the progeny of colonists
driven from England by persecution,
never possessed religious unity. When
Presbyterians, Episcopalians, and Catholics,
who had all fought in common for
independence, assembled in Congress
and formed their constitution, they recognized
the variety of worships as an antecedent
fact, and endeavored to accommodate
themselves to it in the best way they
could. No false political theory disturbed
the good sense of these legislators.
Governed by a necessity manifestly
invincible, and which still continues, they
secured to each worship a complete liberty;
proclaimed that which is a just
consequence from this principle: that the
state should have only a very restricted
agency&mdash;that is, no more than what is
necessary for reconciling the liberty of
each one with that of all others. In fact,
when separated from the true church,
the state is reduced to pure naturalism,
and in this condition the action of the
state, separated from the church, ought
to be reduced to the minimum” (p. 179).</p>

war, and with infinite frankness&mdash;not
stopping with facts, and dates, and figures,
but detailing his remembrance of
conversations, frankly offering his opinion
of motives and his judgment of
character, as well adverse as favorable&mdash;as
readily giving names of those deserving
blame as of those worthy of praise.
No wonder, therefore, that these <cite>Memoirs</cite>
have set the whole country to thinking
about the war, and all the newspapers to
discussing it. We have already had
scores of explanations and defences of
those attacked, or of friends in their behalf,
and we are promised the Memoirs,
Recollections, and Narratives of many
of the more prominent generals; so that
we shall shortly be supplied with testimony
as to all the events of the late war,
given by the actors themselves or by eye-witnesses.</p>

<p>The first six chapters are occupied
with General Sherman’s life from the beginning
of the Mexican war till the outbreak
of the civil war. They are intensely
interesting. Many of those who
afterwards became leaders of great armies
are introduced to the reader as simple
captains or lieutenants in the old army.
Little incidents illustrative of their characters
are continually related, and the
writer’s own impressions, with his unflinching
candor, continually offered,
every page glowing with good-humor
and sparkling with entertaining anecdotes.
The domestic archives of more
than one household of Lancaster, Ohio,
must have been well ransacked to get
the letters written home by the young
artillery lieutenant, in order to secure
such exactness in date, and place, and
conversation. One learns from these
chapters about all that was done in
California during the Mexican war, and
who did it; graphic descriptions of
many of the natural wonders of that
country, and a very interesting account
of the early gold excitement. Gen.
Sherman was on the staff of Col. Mason,
commanding United States forces in
California, when gold was found in Sutter’s
mill-race; was present when Sutter’s
messenger showed it to Col. Mason and
asked for a patent to the land; went to
Sutter’s place, and saw the first miners
at work there; wrote (August 17, 1848)
the official despatch of Col. Mason to
the Adjutant-General which gave the
world the first authentic information that
gold could be had in California for the
digging.</p>

<p>After peace was concluded with Mexico,
the author of the <cite>Memoirs</cite> returned to
the States; but soon resigned his commission,
went back to California, and
opened a banking office in San Francisco&mdash;a
branch of a well-known house
in St. Louis. His statement of the events
of the year 1856 in San Francisco is most
interesting, throwing much light on the
history of the famous Vigilance Committee.
He was Militia General at the time,
and, in conjunction with the Governor,
treated with the leaders of the Committee,
whom he undertakes to convict of
falsehood, positively asserting that, had
Gen. Wool given him the arms, he was
prepared to fight the Vigilantes with
militia, and would have suppressed them.
Hard times induced him shortly after to
wind up his banking business and return
to the States, and in the autumn of
1860, after trying and giving up various
undertakings, he had organized and was
president of a flourishing military school,
under the patronage of the State of
Louisiana. When that State seceded,
Sherman at once resigned and went
North, and when war broke out was
commissioned colonel in the regular
army, rising gradually in rank till finally
half the army and country was subject
to his command.</p>

<p>Now begins his story of the war. To
the most timid civilian there is an intense
fascination in that war&mdash;a deep interest
in every true narrative of it. Gen. Sherman
takes us through some of its most
exciting scenes, and so frankly and so
familiarly that you feel as if you were
some invited stranger, sharing his mess,
discussing his plans, participating in his
hopes and fears, and rejoicing with him
in his nearly uniform success. His first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_858" id="Page_858">[858]</a></span>
battle was Bull Run, in which he commanded
a brigade. Shortly after this he
was transferred to the West, where he
remained until in the winter of 1864-5,
when, having fought and conquered his
way from Chattanooga to Atlanta, then
through Georgia and South Carolina, he
found himself in North Carolina, in command
of a large army, and upon the communications
of Richmond. The General’s
narrative of these four years is
intensely interesting. Every description
of battle or march is intelligible and
vivid, every statement of plans is clear.
The battle of Shiloh is wonderfully well
described; so are the battles which were
fought around Atlanta. The same may
be said of the storming of Fort McAllister&mdash;one
of the most gallant deeds of the
war. Thousands of ex-soldiers will fight
their battles over again with this book&mdash;will
lose themselves in the great mass
of the army&mdash;will struggle once more
against that sickening sensation which
their sense of honor overcame as the first
bullet whistled by, the first pale, senseless
form was borne to the rear on the
bloody stretcher&mdash;will tingle again in
every nerve at the first sight of the
Southerners&mdash;will feel the sudden thrill
of the fearful excitement of the rush, or
of the stubborn defence, or the ecstasy
of victory. Many a one will once more
feel the terrible fatigue of the march, the
pangs of hunger and thirst, the weariness
of sleepless nights on picket, the tedious,
painful weeks spent in hospital. And
every soldier will once more feel sad as
he reads of the places and scenes of the
death of his comrades, and will repeat
for the thousandth time that it was always
the best men who were killed.</p>

<p>The charges of cruelty and barbarity
made during and after the war against
Gen. Sherman are indignantly denied.
The depopulation of the town of Atlanta
is justified in so far as the General clearly
shows the purity of his motives and can
cite the approval of both the civil and
military authorities; yet the ugly fact remains
that it was done not for the instant
safety of his army or the immediate injury
of the enemy’s, but thousands of women
and children were driven among strangers
and their homes abandoned to the
chances of a civil war to secure a temporary
convenience. As to the unauthorized
foraging of the troops generally,
the General condemned and often reproved
and condemned it; though his
correspondence shows a secret satisfaction
at the devastation committed in
South Carolina, except where it might
result in permanent injury to private property.
His defence against Secretary
Stanton’s charges of usurping civil powers
in treating with Gen. Jos. Johnston
is simply complete. Gen. Sherman here
had the honor to be the first after the
war to suffer abuse and persecution because
a kind heart and chivalrous sympathy
with a gallant and beaten foe roused
the hatred and fear of a class of politicians
as malicious and vindictive as they
were ambitious.</p>

<p>The last chapter, “Military Lessons of
the War,” is extremely interesting, especially
to military men. It contains some
very important conclusions; for example,
that infantry must hereafter fight in
skirmishing order; that cavalry can no
longer be used against organized infantry;
that every night’s camp in an enemy’s
vicinity should be covered by light
works; and that good troops with the rifle
can beat off from trenches double their
numbers. All this and nearly all the
other opinions advanced in this chapter
had become truisms to even the common
soldier in our war, and the late Franco-German
war has made them such for the
whole world. But Gen. Sherman’s modesty
has hindered him from showing
that his own persistent adherence to this
new science not only gained him Atlanta,
but left him an intact and veteran army
with which to crush through the heart of
the South; and that Gen. Grant’s neglect
of it, and his adopting the “hammering-away”
method instead, not only did not
conquer Lee and take Richmond, but
positively buried the old gallant Army
of the Potomac between the Rapidan and
the Appomattox.</p>

<p>It is a great injustice to the Army of
the Cumberland and its General to say so
glibly that at Chickamauga “Bragg had
completely driven Rosecrans’ army into
Chattanooga”; it is notorious that at the
battle itself the key of the position was
never given up, and that the whole army
offered battle defiantly at Rossville before
retiring to Chattanooga. Such a
mistake as this throws discredit upon
Gen. Sherman’s statements of other
events of which he was not an eye-witness.
It is also much to be regretted
that in matters wholly private he should
not have reserved the names of persons
whose conduct was reprehensible. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_859" id="Page_859">[859]</a></span>
it adds nothing to the interest of his narrative
to give the <em>name</em> of the officer of
the ship whose incorrect reckoning so
inconvenienced the passengers on the
author’s first voyage to California; or to
give the <em>name</em> of the lawyer who swindled
him out of the proceeds of a note given
him to collect; wife and children and
friends should not be made to share
public disgrace for private acts of which
they themselves are entirely guiltless.</p>

<p>In spite of the confident assurance
which every loyal Catholic has that
the rule of Rome, both temporal and
spiritual, is not, never has been, nor
ever will be, a despotism, it cannot
be denied that but few are well acquainted
with the facts of history which
prove that the Papal power has been the
only interpreter, defender, and protector
of their rights which the people ever had,
and that all the liberties nations now enjoy
are the result of the preaching and
defence of the doctrines which lie at the
basis of all civilization by the popes,
bishops, and priests of the Catholic
Church.</p>

<p>Just new the old howl against Rome is
being renewed&mdash;the howl of the wolves
against the shepherd; and the sheep now
and again think it necessary to apologize
to the wolves for the care their ever-watchful
guardian keeps over them, and
also try to make them understand that it
is both convenient and necessary that he
should keep a dog and carry a crook.
It is little wonder that the wolves bark
and snarl in reply to the apologies, and
see no force in our argument for either
the dog or crook. But the sheep of the
true fold, and also the “other sheep”
who are not yet of it, need, rather, plain,
straightforward instruction, which, by
the grace of God, they will receive to
their profit. Such is the essay before us,
which we heartily welcome as most opportune,
and, although far from being exhaustive
of the subject, is both pertinent
and forcible. We commend it as an excellent
pamphlet to be freely distributed
both among Catholics and honest-minded
American non-Catholics.</p>

<p>This is the thirteenth volume of the admirable
Quarterly Series edited by the
Jesuit fathers in London. The “Story”
is a brief one, but full of interest. We
confess that S. Stanislaus has always
seemed to us more charming than even
S. Aloysius. Both “angelic youths” are
among the greatest glories of the Catholic
Church and the Society of Jesus.</p>

<p>Father Coleridge tells us that the present
work was at first intended to be a
simple translation from the Italian of
Father Boero, but that he has taken the
pains to prepare an original narrative
instead. All who know his style will be
grateful for the exchange. He has also
confined himself to a narration of facts,
without digressing into “religious and
moral reflections.” We think this, too,
makes the volume more attractive, particularly
to the young.</p>

<p>It is somewhat aggravating to those
familiar with the larger biographical dictionaries
to take up a compilation like
this. One is reminded of the poet who
sent his MSS. to a learned editor to prepare
them for publication, and, after
hearing the judgment passed by the
critic, insisted that he had thrown out
the best pieces and retained the only
trash in the collection. The reader must
try to put himself in the place of the compiler
who undertakes the invidious task
of determining who to speak of and what
to say in a book of the kind. Almost
inevitably, each reader has to regret the
absence of some subjects by him deemed
important. But, at least, the work will
serve as an introduction to more exhaustive
ones, and Catholics have an
assurance in the editor that the stale assertions
against cherished names, lay or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_860" id="Page_860">[860]</a></span>

New York: The Catholic Publication
Society, 9 Warren St. 1875.</p>

</div>

<p>This is the last volume of the Young
Catholic’s Illustrated Series of Readers.
We have read it with considerable care,
and are of the opinion that it is the best
book of the kind in the English language.
The selections, which embrace
a wide range of subjects, all bearing
more or less directly upon the mission
and work of woman, have been made
with discernment and taste. The most
important lessons are here taught in the
most agreeable style and in the pleasantest
manner. It is a treatise on the duties
of Christian women without any of the
dulness of the moral essay.</p>

<p>We admire especially the biographical
sketches of the foundresses of religious
orders which are scattered here
and there through the book. Whatever
the vocation of a young girl may be, she
will be all the truer and nobler woman
for having been taught to reverence and
love the religious life.</p>

<p>The perusal of the several Readers of
the Young Catholic’s Series has shown
us, in a light in which we have never
seen it before, the great educational
value of such books. We are not surprised
at the favorable manner in which
these Readers have been received, nor
shall we be astonished to hear of their
superseding all others in our Catholic
Schools.</p>

sed quod talem haberet, ut, si appareret, insolitum
et incongruum aversaretur sensus meus, et conturbaretur
infirmitas hominis. Verum illud quod cogitabam,
non privatione omnis formæ, sed comparatione
formosiorum erat informe: et suadebat vera
ratio ut omnis formæ qualescumque reliquias omnino
detraherem, si vellem prorsus informe cogitare;
et non poteram. Citius enim non esse censebam
quod omni forma privaretur, quam cogitabam quiddam
inter formatum et nihil, nec formatum, nec
nihil, informe prope nihil. Et cessavit mens mea
interrogare hinc spiritum meum plenum imaginibus
formatorum corporum et eas pro arbitrio mutantem

res mutabiles. Et hæc quid est? Numquid

are substantially those of Mr. D. F. MacCarthy,
whose works have been noticed before. We cannot
refrain from again expressing our admiration and
wonder at the successful manner in which he has
overcome difficulties almost insuperable, and which
no one can appreciate until he has himself attempted
to translate Spanish <i lang="es">asonantes</i> into corresponding
English verse.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_56" id="Footnote_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56"><span class="label">[56]</span></a> We have already spoken of Spanish <i lang="es">asonante</i>
rhyme and the difficulty of its translation into corresponding
English verse.</p>

<p>For those who are unacquainted with Spanish
prosody the following explanation of what the
<i lang="es">asonante</i> is may not be amiss.</p>

<p>Assonance consists simply in the similarity of the
final, or last two vowels in the line, <i>e. g.</i>, <i lang="es">luna</i>, <i lang="es">juzoa</i>,
<i lang="es">culpas</i>, <i lang="es">gula</i>, <i lang="es">suma</i>. These all are considered to
rhyme because they have the same vowels, <em>u-a</em>;
<i lang="es">honor</i>, <i lang="es">sol</i>, <i lang="es">hoy</i>, <i lang="es">dió</i>, <i lang="es">cuatro</i>, are examples of single
<i lang="es">asonantes</i> in <em>o</em>.</p>

<p>Dean Trench calls this the “ghost and shadow of
a rhyme.” How well Mr. MacCarthy has succeeded
in reproducing it the reader can see in the above
extract. The <i lang="es">asonantes</i> in the original are <em>u-a</em>, for
which Mr. MacCarthy has substituted <em>u-e</em>.</p>

man, but also a peripatetic at heart, candidly confesses
that the peripatetic view of generation has
never been substantiated. “Depend upon it,” says
he, “either no sound argument can be adduced in
proof of the peripatetic system, and we must, accordingly,
simply postulate it; or, if any proof can be
adduced, it consists in the sole argument from authority.”
Crede mihi; vel solidi nihil afferri potest
pro systemate peripatetico adstruendo, adeoque simpliciter
erit postulandum; vel unico a nobis allecto
argumento (auctoritatis) satis est roboris ad ipsum
confirmandum.&mdash;<cite>Phil. Mentis et Sensuum</cite>, diss 8,
phys. gen. concl. 2. And speaking of the argument
drawn from substantial changes, he declares it to be
a mere sophism: Est mera petitio principii, et
æquivocatio inter materiam primam ab omnibus philosophis
admissam, et materiam primam Aristotelicam.&mdash;<cite>Ibid.</cite>

Jones, and such as he, have had much to do with
bringing about this magnificent result. Their
course of treatment of the unfortunate children committed
to their care is sufficiently well known to
many of our readers. Here is a picture of Mr.
Jones and his associate reformers, painted by his own
hand, and exhibited to the public gaze in a court of
justice. It occurred during the trial of Justus Dunn,
an inmate of the Institution for the Reformation of
Juvenile Delinquents, for the killing of Samuel Calvert,
one of the keepers. In his cross-examination
Mr Jones testified respecting various modes of
punishment used in the institution. One was as
follows: “I know of Ward being tied up by the
thumbs. (The witness described this mode of
punishment.) In the tailor’s shop there is an iron
column five inches in diameter; around the top of
that was placed a small cord, and another small cord
was run through it, and dropped down; <em>the boys’
thumbs were put into the ends and drawn up until
the arms were extended</em>, but their feet were
not moved.</p>

<p>“By Judge Bedford: How long were they kept in
that position? A. From three, perhaps to eight
minutes. To Mr Howe: I tried the effect upon
myself; it was an idea that struck me to deal with
that particular class of boys. I think seven, not to
exceed eight, boys were punished in this way. I was
present during the punishment of one of the boys
part of the time. I went out of the room.</p>

<p>“By Judge Bedford: You do not know of your
own knowledge whether they were raised from the
ground? A. Not of my own knowledge.</p>

<p>“By Mr. Howe: You saw the boys put up by this
small whip-cord? A. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>“Q. And you would leave the room when they
were spliced up? A. Yes, sir; I stepped out of
the room once or twice. I have seen boys beaten
with a rattan, but not so severely as to be able to
count the welts by the blood.”</p>

<p>There is much more of the same character, but
the extract given is enough to show the means adopted
in this estimable institution and by this eminently
pious superintendent for the reformation of juvenile
delinquents. It is like reading again the pages
of another but an earlier Reformation.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_96" id="Footnote_96"></a><a href="#FNanchor_96"><span class="label">[96]</span></a> During the residence of the popes at Avignon,
and afterwards until about the time of the Council
of Trent, it was usual to call cardinals by the name
of their native places or of their dioceses, as the Cardinal
of Gaeta (Cajetan), the Cardinal of Toledo.
This was the case at first possibly because the cardinals
were not very familiar with their titles on the
banks of the Tiber, which many of them never saw,
and may have been kept up afterwards when the
popes returned to Rome, in some degree by that
love of grand nomenclature which characterized the
age of the revival of letters. It requires sometimes
no little search to discover the <em>real</em> name
of one who is called in history, for instance, the Cardinal
of S. Chrysogonus (Cardinalis Sancti Chrysogoni)
or the Cardinal of Pavia (Cardinalis Papiensis).</p>

<p>The present style has long been to call cardinals
by their family names; but if these be ancient or
memorable ones, there is a recognized form of Latinization
not to be departed from. Thus, to give an
example, the late Cardinal Prince Altieri was in
Latin Cardinalis de Alteriis.</p>

space, but only the intervals or distances (which are
relations in space) that are really mensurable, as we
shall see in our next article. Yet, as the phrase was
used in the objection, we kept it in our answer, on
the ground that, although absolute space is not formally
mensurable in itself, it is the reason of the mensurability
of all intervals arising from its extrinsic
terminations.</p>

<p>“S. Felix received a remarkable favor from the
Blessed Virgin Mother. All the brethren remaining
asleep, and, by the disposition of God, not rising
for the celebration of Matins, which were to have
been recited at midnight on the Vigil of the Blessed
Mother’s Nativity, Felix awoke, as was his custom,
and entering into the choir before the time, found
there the Blessed Virgin herself, clothed in a habit
marked with the cross of the order, and in company
with a number of angels habited in the same manner.
Felix, taking his place amongst them, sang
through and finished the entire Office, the Blessed
Mother herself acting the part of precentor.”&mdash;<cite>Breviarium

<p><a name="Footnote_143" id="Footnote_143"></a><a href="#FNanchor_143"><span class="label">[143]</span></a> Mgr. Parisis continues: “My dear friends and
brethren, we have ourselves never precisely seen
these sweet days of the faith; but in our very early
youth we seem to have caught, as it were, their
last twilight; we well remember that the sounds
which first caught our ear were the sweet melodies
of the Liturgy, and during that Reign of Terror
when they were banished from the churches, we
bless God with all our heart on recollecting the
holiday evenings when we were rewarded by being
allowed to sing with the family the touching
mysteries of the Divine Son of Mary, at one time
in the language of the Church, at another in the
well-known tongue of our religious ancestors.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_144" id="Footnote_144"></a><a href="#FNanchor_144"><span class="label">[144]</span></a> It is a fashion to despise <em>unison singing</em>; yet
the highest authorities in the church have given it
their decided preference. The Pontiffs John XXII.
and Benedict XIV. have recommended unison singing
to the whole church as the fittest; Abbot Gerbert
and Cardinal Bona recognize its superiority;
Mgr. Parisis says, “We speak here exclusively of
<em>unison singing, because it is this that best suits
the church</em>.” Conceit and fashion may be and
most probably are at the bottom of such a feeling
of contempt; and of course where the singing is
confined to a limited number, individuals will naturally
wish for an opportunity of displaying their
own little talent. “Omnium hominum,” is Guido
of Arezzi’s experience, “fatuissimi cantores.” S.
Bernard says: “That new canticle, which it will
be given to virgins alone to sing in the kingdom of
God, there is no one who doubts but that the Queen
of Virgins herself will be the first to sing; and I

which is common to her with others, she will delight
the city of God with some still sweeter and
more beautiful song, the exquisite melody of which
no other virgin will be found worthy to sing, save
her only who may boast of having given birth, and
that to God” (II. Homily on <cite>Missus est Gabriel</cite>).

<p><a name="Footnote_176" id="Footnote_176"></a><a href="#FNanchor_176"><span class="label">[176]</span></a> We quote at length the remarkable passage from
which these words are quoted. It occurs in an allocution
of the Holy Father to the cardinals, delivered
in the Secret Consistory, Sept. 5, 1851, in which
his Holiness announces the concordat which had recently
been concluded with the Spanish government
“The great object of our solicitude was to
secure the integrity of our holy religion and to provide
for the spiritual wants of the church. Now,
you will see, the concordat arranges that the Catholic
religion, with all the rights it enjoys by virtue
of its divine institution, and of rules established by
the sacred canons, should be exclusively dominant
in that kingdom; every other religion will be openly
banished from it and forbidden. It is, consequently,
settled that the manner of educating and
instructing the youth in all the universities, colleges
or seminaries, in all the public and private
schools, will be in full conformity with the doctrine
of the Catholic religion. The bishops and heads
of dioceses, who, by virtue of their office, are bound
to labor with all their might to protect the purity
of Catholic teaching, to propagate it, to watch that
the youth receive a Christian education, will find
no obstacle to the accomplishment of those duties;
they will be able, without meeting the least hindrance,
to exercise the most attentive superintendence
over the schools, even the public ones, and to
discharge freely, in all its plenitude, their office of
pastor.” Is not this, in exact terms, the thesis here
defended?</p>

written the 15th of March, 1820, by Father Fenwick
to the author of this notice: “I hope that this
will find you in good health and on the point of returning
to America. It will be a great pleasure for
me to see you again and to hear from your lips the
particulars of your trip. If possible, bring me home
some pictures. With gratitude would I receive
some for the altars of the Blessed Virgin and S. Joseph,
as also any other church furniture or books,
such as the lives of the saints of the Order of S.
Dominic by Father Touron, the history of the
miracles of the holy fathers, or any other works on
those subjects. If you saw my relative, M. J. F., I
flatter myself sufficiently to hope that you remembered
me to him, and that you laid before him the
needs of my mission. We have built three churches,
and only for one of these three do we possess sufficient
ornaments and other articles necessary for
divine service.”</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_190" id="Footnote_190"></a><a href="#FNanchor_190"><span class="label">[190]</span></a> We have to-day in the United States five bishops
of French origin: Bishop Maréchal, born at
Ingré, in the Diocese of Orleans, third archbishop of
Baltimore; Bishop Cheverus, of Paris, first bishop
of Boston; Bishop Flaget, born in Auvergne, bishop
of Kentucky, and Bishop David, of the Diocese
of Nantes, his coadjutor; and, finally, Bishop Dubourg,
bishop of Louisiana and the Floridas, who
resides in St. Louis on the Mississippi, in the State
of Missouri. The see of Philadelphia became vacant
by the death of Bishop Egan, and that of New
York is occupied by Bishop Connelly, an Irishman
of the Order of S. Dominic. The number of
American bishops is continually increasing. New
Orleans and the Floridas are too far from St. Louis;
the Dioceses of Baltimore and Bardstown are too extensive;
and, moreover, the number of Catholics is
daily increasing, in consequence of the immigrations
from Europe and from conversions.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_191" id="Footnote_191"></a><a href="#FNanchor_191"><span class="label">[191]</span></a> By his writings you can judge the man; and we
can give you no better idea of the mildness, humility,
and modesty of the Bishop of Bardstown than by
inserting here extracts from several letters which he
wrote from Baltimore to his vicar-general in Kentucky.
His zeal, his disinterestedness, and his self-abnegation
are equalled only by his confidence in
divine Providence: “God be my witness that I do
not desire riches; and I would a thousand times
rather die than be attacked by this craving. The
less we possess, the less worried will we be with regard
to it; but there are some things necessary, and
it is upon you that I depend to procure them for
me. I must rely upon the friendship which you
have for me to ask you, my dear M. Badin, henceforth
to provide for my wants. After all, you desired
it; for if it had not been for you, I would never
have been made bishop. We will have eight or nine
trunks filled with books and other articles. The distance
is great and transportation very high; the
trip and the transportation will cost more than 4,000
francs, and we have not a cent. We can only wait
until Providence comes to our rescue. To lessen my
expenses I will leave the servant who offers me his
services in Baltimore; and I would even leave my
books there, did I not consider them essential to our
establishment. In order not to increase your expenses
I will only bring with me M. David, and we
will both be but too happy to share your mode of
life, however humble it may be. If the bishopric
had only presented difficulties of this nature, I
would not have hesitated so long before accepting
it. Providence calls me to it despite myself, and it was
useless for me to travel over land and sea in order to
evade this charge. All my trouble was lost. God
seems to exact it of me that I bow my head to this
weighty yoke, even though it should crush me.
Alas! should I stop sufficiently long to consider my
weakness and my troubles, I would fall into despair,
and hardly would I dare take one step in the vast
career that is opening before me. To reassure myself
it is necessary that I frequently recall to mind
that I did not install myself in this important post,
and that all my earthly superiors in a manner forced
me to accept it.”</p>

<p>From Baltimore, where he had more than one
hundred miles by land and three hundred miles by
water over which to travel to arrive at Bardstown,
he writes thus: “Remember that for the use of
seven or eight we have but one horse, which I destine
for M. David, as he is the least active among
us. For myself and the other gentlemen, we will go
on foot with the greatest pleasure, if there is the
least difficulty in travelling otherwise. This pilgrimage
will please me exceedingly, and I do not
think it derogatory to my dignity. I leave it all to
your judgment, and I would be very glad to have
sufficient money to join you at Louisville; the remainder
of the journey will be entirely at your expense.
That the will of God be done, I would a
thousand times prefer going on foot rather than to
cause the slightest murmur; and you did very well
to recall the subscription which had been started for
my benefit, as it would only have tended to alienate
people from me. It was, however, but right that
people anxious to have a bishop among them should
furnish him means to reach them. There is nothing
I would not do for the sanctification of my flock.
My time, my work, my life even, is consecrated to
it; and, finally, it will only remain for me to say that
I am ‘an unprofitable servant, having done only that
which I ought to do.’”</p>

<p>Divine Providence, whose intervention he had
merited by his zeal and his resignation, supplied, as
if by miracle, in some invisible way, the needs of the
prelate, who on the 11th of June, 1811, arrived at St.
Etienne, the residence of M. Badin, with two priests
and four scholastics. There he found the faithful
on their knees singing holy canticles, the women
nearly all robed in white, and some of them still fasting,
although it was then four o’clock in the afternoon,
as they hoped to assist at his Mass and receive
Holy Communion from his hands that very day. An
altar had been erected under some shrubbery to afford
a shade where the bishop might rest himself.
After the Asperges he was conducted in procession
to the chapel, the Litany of the Blessed Virgin
being sung meanwhile; and then followed the
ceremonies and prayers prescribed in the Pontifical
for such an occasion. M. Badin lived in a little
frame house, and, in consequence of the expenses incurred
to rebuild the burned monastery of which we
have already spoken, he with difficulty was able to
build two miserable little huts, sixteen feet square, for
his illustrious friend and the ecclesiastics who accompanied
him. Finally, one of the missionaries slept on
a mattress in the attic of this whitewashed episcopal
palace, whose sole furniture consisted of one bed,
six chairs, two tables, and the shelves for a library.
The bishop resided here one year, and he considered
himself happy to live thus in the midst of apostolic
poverty.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_192" id="Footnote_192"></a><a href="#FNanchor_192"><span class="label">[192]</span></a> The Dominican Fathers, assisted by their novices,
with their own hands performed a great deal
of the work on their monastery and the beautiful
church of S. Rose. Like them, the scholastics afterwards
made bricks and lime, cut the wood, etc., to
build that of S. Thomas, the seminary, and convent
of Nazareth. The poverty of our establishment
forces them to devote their hours of recreation to
this work. Every day they spend three hours in
gardening, in working in the fields or in the woods.
Nothing could be more frugal than their table,
and that of the two bishops is no better; pure
water from a spring is their ordinary drink. Neither
could anything be more humble than their clothing&mdash;imagine
fifty poor scholastics who are obliged to
cover themselves with rags, and to borrow decent
clothes with which to appear in the town.</p>

<p>Bishop Flaget hopes that pious and charitable
persons who are not able to send him money for his
cathedral will endeavor to send clothes or books
necessary for the studies and the clothing of his
beloved scholastics.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
